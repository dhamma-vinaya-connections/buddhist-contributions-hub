# Welcome to the Buddhist Contributions Hub

The **Buddhist Contributions Hub** is an offline, all-in-one workspace built with **Obsidian** for exploring, studying, and taking notes on **Early Buddhist texts**.

It brings together canonical texts (suttas and vinaya) with community-contributed materials—so you can **study deeply on your own**, while also **benefiting from and contributing to shared insights**.

No internet connection is required once everything is set up.

## Purpose

The core aim of this project is to **interconnect Early Buddhist texts in a meaningful and practical way**.

This hub allows:

- Suttas and Vinaya texts to be linked to each other
    
- Study guides, essays, books, Maps of Content (MOCs), and articles to reference suttas directly
    
- Readers to move easily between teachings, explanations, and reflections
    

By opening the project to public contributions, we support **kalyāṇamittas (spiritual friends)** in sharing insights that may help others on the path.

## How This Works

This repository is designed to be used **together with** the main text collection:

**Early Buddhist Connections**  
[https://github.com/dhamma-vinaya-connections/early-buddhist-connections](https://github.com/dhamma-vinaya-connections/early-buddhist-connections)

### Setup (Step by Step)

1. **Install Obsidian**  
    [https://obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md)
    
2. **Download the canonical texts**  
    From the _Early Buddhist Connections_ releases page:  
    [https://github.com/dhamma-vinaya-connections/early-buddhist-connections/releases](https://github.com/dhamma-vinaya-connections/early-buddhist-connections/releases)
    
3. **Download the latest contributions**  
    From this repository’s releases page:  
    [https://github.com/dhamma-vinaya-connections/buddhist-contributions-hub/releases](https://github.com/dhamma-vinaya-connections/buddhist-contributions-hub/releases)
    
4. **Unzip both downloads**
    
5. **Copy the contributions folder**  
    Place it inside the main _Early Buddhist Connections_ folder.
    
6. **Open the main folder in Obsidian**
    

That’s it—you’re ready to explore.

## Taking Your Own Notes

You’re encouraged to create your own notes inside the vault.

A simple way to do this:

- Create a personal notes folder
    
- Tag your notes with `#mynotes`
    
- Link your reflections to relevant suttas or Vinaya texts
    

This keeps your work personal while still fully connected to the wider system.

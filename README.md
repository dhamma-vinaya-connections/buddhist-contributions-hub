# Buddhist Contributions Hub

The Buddhist Contributions Hub is an offline, Obsidian-based workspace for studying Early Buddhist texts alongside community-contributed materials.

Once set up, everything works fully offline.

## 🌏 What This Project Is

This hub brings together:

Canonical suttas and Vinaya

Essays, books, and study guides

Maps of Content (MOCs)

This allows:

Direct linking between suttas and Vinaya texts

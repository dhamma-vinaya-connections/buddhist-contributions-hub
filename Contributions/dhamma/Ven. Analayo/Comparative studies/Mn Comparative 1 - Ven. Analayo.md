Dharma Drum Buddhist College Series


In 1994, Master Sheng Yen (1931–2009), the founder of Dharma Drum Buddhist
College, began publishing the Series of the Chung-Hwa Institute of Buddhist Studies.
The purposes of publishing this series were: to provide a venue for academic research
in Buddhist Studies supported by scholarships from the Chung-Hwa Institute of Buddhist Studies; to encourage top-quality Buddhist research; and to cultivate an interest in
Buddhist research among the readership of the series. Moreover, by encouraging cooperation with international research institutions, he hoped to promote the domestic
status of the academic study of Buddhism.
In keeping with Master Sheng Yen’s vision, in order to promote different aspects of
exchange in academic research, we at Dharma Drum Buddhist College have begun to
publish three educational series:

Dharma Drum Buddhist College Research Series (DDBC-RS),
Dharma Drum Buddhist College Translation Series (DDBC-TS)
Dharma Drum Buddhist College Special Series (DDBC-SS)

The Research Series (DDBC-RS) is primarily intended as a venue for academic research in the field of Buddhist Studies in general and of Chinese Buddhism in particular. The Translation Series (DDBC-TS) will present English renditions of Chinese canonical works as well as other important works, or else Chinese translations of academic publications on Buddhism that have appeared in European languages or Japanese, etc. The Special Series (DDBC-SS) will accommodate works which require special publication formats.
Among our future goals is the extensive development of Buddhist digital publishing
and information to adapt to the interactive and hyper-connective environment of the
Web 2.0 age. This will allow research outcomes to be quickly shared and evaluated
through the participation of individual users, through such media as blogs, shared tagging, wikis, social networks and so on. Our hope is to work towards developing an
open environment for academic studies (perhaps called Science 2.0) on Buddhist culture that will be more collaborative and efficient than traditional academic studies. In
this way, Dharma Drum Buddhist College will continue to help foster the availability
of digital resources for Buddhist Studies.

Foreword

This book presents a comparative study of the discourses that make up the Pāli Majjhima-nikāya, alongside their known parallels transmitted in other reciter traditions and
preserved in various languages, mainly in Chinese translations.
The field of comparative Nikāya-Āgama studies dates back a century to the groundbreaking work of Anesaki Masaharu. [1] It has recently entered a period of rapid growth,
and in the present book the venerable Anālayo contributes substantially to this newly
invigorated branch of Buddhist Studies. The only real forerunner to this study is The
Chinese Madhyama Āgama and the Pāli Majjhima Nikāya, by Thich Minh Chau. [2]
Whereas Minh Chau’s book is organised according to the Chinese Madhyama-āgama,
the present study is organised according to the Pāli Majjhima-nikāya. It differs further
in dealing with all the Majjhima-nikāya discourses and in taking account of a maximally wide range of known parallel discourses. These include not only discourses contained in the Chinese Āgamas, but also individual Chinese translations, Tibetan translations, fragmentary Sanskrit remains, and some quotations found in later texts - together
with full or partial parallels from within the Pāli Tipi�aka. Thus, the present work, despite having a broadly similar objective to Minh Chau’s study, differs from it significantly in covering an entire Nikāya in light of all its known parallels.
The main bulk of the book is made up of chapters 1 to 15, which correspond to the
fifteen vaggas of the Majjhima-nikāya. In these chapters, each of the discourses making up those vaggas is examined alongside its parallel(s), with regard to structure, contents, and other essential features. Generally, this comparison reveals broad agreement
among the different versions, but often enough it brings to light significant differences
in detail. Such differences are then discussed in terms of their possible historical causes:
sectarian doctrinal slant, the vicissitudes of oral transmission, insertion of commentarial material, translation errors, and so on. Where possible, a judgement is then made
on which of the versions is most likely to have accurately preserved this or that component of the message.
Such analytical procedures raise some crucial issues of methodology, which are duly
discussed in the book’s Preface. There the author draws attention to the traditional
criterion of coherence and consistency, which is invoked repeatedly in the Buddha’s discourses. With good reason he adopts this criterion as a basic methodological principle
for the study. Any perceived instance of incoherence in the texts being studied (for example, mutually contradictory statements within a discourse or between versions of a
discourse) is deemed to require explanation in terms of faulty oral transmission or some
other historical process. At the same time, the author acknowledges the difficulty of
deciding what constitutes an instance of incoherence or inconsistency; for example,
statements that seem to contradict each other could instead be complementing each other.

xx   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


Explanation in terms of transmission errors requires at least a preliminary concept of
how the discourses might have been committed to memory and then passed on within
the Sa�gha. The author provides the basis for such a concept by discussing characteristics of oral transmission within Buddhist traditions.
Having initiated this discussion of oral transmission in the Introduction, the author
subsequently develops it in the Conclusion. He also brings into consideration outcomes
of relevant psychological research. An example is the proposition that, whereas the
Vedic style of memorization would have been conducive to accurate verbatim replication, the Buddhist style would have been conducive to inference-drawing and consequent restructuring of the memorized material. Such observations reveal a characteristic of the oral transmission that has not previously received due recognition: not all of
the variations between different versions of a discourse can be attributed to conscious
editing. By thus drawing attention to the role of the reciters, this section incidentally
provides a welcome human context for the findings of the text-comparative side of the
project.
Particularly instructive is the discussion of the probable role of commentary in
modifying memorized discourses. Here the author examines how the distinction between discourse and commentary appears to have become blurred. The examples cited
demonstrate how a discrepancy between a Pāli sutta and its Chinese parallel can be
explained in terms of unconscious incorporation of commentarial material.
The Conclusion, and with it the entire work, finishes up with a simple but significant
observation: the study has revealed no evidence that any particular line of transmission
has preserved the discourses more faithfully than the others. An implication of this is
that the researcher should not rely exclusively on any one version of the Nikāyas/Āgamas. In particular, study of the Pāli Nikāyas alone can yield only a partial and imperfect picture. For a maximally complete and clear picture, the Pāli suttas must be compared with their available Chinese and other parallels.
In carrying out this project, the venerable Anālayo has established a challenging precedent. It is to be hoped that this book will inspire the production of similarly comprehensive studies based on the remaining Pāli Nikāyas and their Chinese counterparts.

Preface: Research Scope and Purpose

The present work is a revised version of my habilitation research, conducted under
Professor Michael Hahn at the University of Marburg, which had as its point of departure my wish to come to a better understanding of the discourses found in the Majjhima-nikāya. I had earlier undertaken a study of the Satipa��hāna-sutta found in the Majjhima-nikāya for my PhD, during the course of which the significance of the parallels
to this discourse preserved in Chinese had become increasingly evident to me. The
successful conclusion of my PhD in 2000 afforded me the time to learn Chinese (and
eventually Tibetan), equipped with which it was only natural to embark on a comparative study of the Satipa��hāna-sutta, followed by extending this research and examining to the other discourses found in the same collection in the light of their parallels
preserved by other reciter traditions, extant mainly in Chinese, Sanskrit, and Tibetan. [3]
In what follows, I present the results of these studies in the sequence in which the respective discourses occur in the Majjhima-nikāya, thereby providing a kind of modern
commentary to each of the Pāli discourses. [4]
My examination of differences between various versions of a discourse is undertaken
not only from the perspective of textual transmission, but also from the viewpoint of
their implications for doctrinal aspects of early Buddhism, thus combining a textual
study with a study of the thought world of early Buddhism. [5] However, my main focus

3 While my study is deeply indebted to Minh Chau 1964/1991, it differs in that I take into account all discourses in the Majjhima-nikāya and examine them in the light not only of their Madhyama-āgama parallels, but also take into accout parallels found in the other three Chinese Āgamas, in individual Chinese
translations, in Sanskrit fragments and Tibetan texts, and in a few instances in parallels preserved in
other languages. Although drawing mainly on the early discourses, I have at times taken into account
relevant material from the Vinayas, and from works of the jātaka or avadāna type, whenever possible.
With a few exceptions, I have not consulted discourse quotations found in later works and treatises. To
attempt to do so in a comprehensive way would have stretched the scope of my research beyond the
bounds of feasibility. In those instances where I have been able to include relevant instances, for works
like the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya or the Yogācārabhūmi I usually add references to the Chinese version(s)
alongside the Sanskrit text, but not to the Tibetan.
4 The decision to take a Pāli discourse collection as my starting point does not intend to present a value
judgement of the Pāli Nikāyas as such. Instead, it simply reflects the fact that the Pāli Nikāyas have preserved the most complete body of texts representative of early Buddhist literature that has been transmitted by a single Buddhist school. Since my study is based on a Pāli discourse collection, I have decided to use Pāli terminology (except for anglicized terms like Dharma and the term Nirvā�a) in my discussion and when translating from Chinese, etc. (without in each case marking such usage with a *), at
times even when referring to sources that are originally in Sanskrit. With this I do not intend to present
Pāli terminology as being in principle preferable. Rather, my decision is simply guided by the wish to
make reading easier through introducing some degree of consistency in the use of proper names and to
facilitate comparison with the Pāli discourses. By using Pāli terms, I also do not intend to take a position
on the Indic original on which the Chinese or other translations were based. For transcribing Chinese
characters I use the pīn-yīn ( system, for Romanizing Tibetan the system devised by Wylie 1959.
On my use of the notion of a “parallel” cf. below p. 1035.

is on those formal differences and textual characteristics that can contribute to an understanding of the early discourses as testimonies of the early Buddhist oral tradition.
This focus on an understanding of the early Buddhist oral tradition naturally leads me
to an emphasis on the Pāli Nikāyas and the Chinese Āgamas, since these are entire collections of texts transmitted by particular reciter traditions. In order to reach a maximum degree of comprehensiveness and to fully explore the potential of the discourse
material preserved in Chinese, [6] in addition to these collections I have also tried to take
into account parallels to a particular Majjhima-nikāya discourse found outside of the
Āgamas. Thus my comparative studies also cover a number of individual Chinese
translations, discourses that have been translated “individually” or singly, in as much
as I have been aware of their paralleling a Majjhima-nikāya discourse.
Some of these individual Chinese translations date back to the very beginnings of organized translation activity in the second century AD and are thus fascinating testimonies to the endeavour and the struggles of the Chinese translators, who stood at the beginning of a translation enterprise that produced one of the most extensive collections
of translated material in the history of mankind. The gap they had to bridge could not
have been wider, as they had to come to grips with the thoroughly structured grammar
of Sanskrit and Middle Indic languages, even though their native language knew no equivalent to these. [7] The difficulties involved in bridging this gap have inevitably influenced


much as these were known and available to me. The broad scope of my work has prevented me from
undertaking a more exhaustive survey of relevant publications, hence my references are only meant to
provide a starting point for further bibliographical research by those interested in following up a particular topic. I also need to mention that limitations of space and time have not made it possible for me to
discuss various theories or propositions advanced in some of these secondary publications. Thus often I
just refer to a comment or a proposition that seems to me significant and worthwhile quoting, without
thereby necessarily agreeing with points made elsewhere in the same publication. Another shortcoming I
would like to put on record is that my ignorance of Japanese has prevented me from taking into account
research published in that language (except for editions of Sanskrit texts).
6 Regarding the potential and importance of the material preserved in Chinese, de Jong 1968: 15 comments that “no student of Buddhism, even if he is interested only in Indian Buddhism, can neglect the
enormous corpus of Chinese translations”; cf. also de Jong 1974: 76-78. As Lancaster 1979: 224-226
points out, “in the Chinese canon we have an invaluable source of evidence ... with some assurance that
those translators knew their craft and practiced it with vigour and accuracy”. He notes that “writing was
of necessity the skill of a learned person ... important manuscripts were given to the most educated and
skilled calligraphers for copying ... the result of the Chinese scribal procedure has been great accuracy in
the transmission of the texts”. Carrithers 1983a: 8 sums up that “though the Pali texts are still the single
most useful source ... in many respects they can be corrected and improved by readings from the Central
Asian finds or from Tibetan and Chinese. Certainly the Tibetan and Chinese sources are indispensable
for establishing what the oldest sources are”.
7 Link 1961: 283-284 notes that the early Chinese Buddhists lacked “both the terminology and even the
conceptual framework for handling formal linguistic and grammatical problems”, in fact “the very notion
of what constitutes a ‘word’ led to enormous difficulties”, as “Chinese has no inflectional morphology”,
so that “a word was a logograph, a ‘character’” and “as such it was felt by the Chinese to be immutable”.
Moreover, “gender (unknown in Chinese) seems to have impressed Chinese Buddhist philologists as
something quite strange”. Besides, there were “the difficulties of grasping an alphabetic, as opposed to a

the quality of the translations undertaken during this period, so that the Chinese of such
individual translations can at times be cryptic and difficult to understand, and translation errors have inevitably left their impact on the present shape of these discourses.
Nevertheless, at times they offer interesting perspectives on a particular passage. [8]
My studies in the following pages are mainly based on reporting and examining differences that to me seem relevant from the viewpoint of the respective Majjhima-nikāya discourse. [9] When comparing different versions of a discourse, one is inevitably


logographic, writing system”. Nattier 1990: 208 explains that “it would be difficult to find two more dissimilar languages than Chinese and Sanskrit (or Prakrit). The language families to which they belong are
totally unrelated, their grammars are a study in contrasts, and they shared (at least prior to the arrival of
Buddhism in China) virtually no vocabulary in common”; cf. also von Humboldt 1836/2003: 138.
8 A proper understanding of such discourses requires a detailed study of and familiarity with the translation terminology of the respective translator(s), whose identity often needs first of all to be ascertained
(cf., e.g., the survey in Nattier 2008). Since I lack such specialist knowledge, my studies of these individual translations remain to some degree provisional and I had to rest content with simply giving the identity of the translator as recorded in the Taishō edition, without attempting to ascertain the probability of
such identifications or trying to determine the precise time of translation. The broad scope of my research has made such more detailed investigations impossible.
9 In regard to translation terminology, in general I just follow the established renderings. Thus while in
Anālayo 2003a I used “cognition” for saññā, now I follow the example of Skilling 1997a: 477 note 31
and adopt the more frequently used rendering “perception”, although perhaps “(conceptual) identification”
(cf. Potter 1996: 128) would best convey the implications of the term. Key terms where I depart from the
standard renderings are bodhi, dukkha, and satipa��hāna. By rendering bodhi as “awakening”, instead of
“enlightenment”, I follow suggestions made by Migot 1952: 450 and Norman 1990: 26, cf. also Collins
1998: 213. They point out that √budh means to “wake up” or “awaken”, and does not bear a relation to
light, cf., e.g., [[MN54]] at MN I 365,31, where pa�ibuddho describes someone who wakes up from sleep.
In fact, although [[MN4]] at MN I 23,26 presents the Buddha’s awakening as the overcoming of the darkness of ignorance, avijjā vihatā ... tamo vihato, and [[AN7.89]] at AN II 140,2 speaks of wisdom as a supreme light, paññobhāso, [[AN5.75]] at AN I 236,17, [[AN7.3]] at AN IV 3,9, and Th 906 compare the experience of Nirvā�a, equivalent to bodhi, to the extinction of a light, instead of the appearance of a light.
Even the expression āloko udapādi, used in relation to the Buddha’s awakening in [[SN56.11]] at SN V
422,5, does not seem to refer to the arising of “light”, but rather to the arising of “clarity” (cf. also the
definition of ālokasaññī in Vibh 254,13, and the point made by Gokhale 1989: 6 that any manifestation
of the element fire, teja, would be absent from the Nibbānic experience, e.g., [[UD8.1]] at [[UD80.11]]).
Gimello 2004: 50 comments that “those who are attentive to the more literal meaning of the Indic original tend to translate bodhi in English as ‘awakening’, and this is to be recommended”. In regard to dukkha, although this term at times stands for “pain” as a felt experience, in other contexts it covers all types
of feeling, instances where a translation as “suffering” runs the risk of being misleading (cf. also, e.g.,
Collins 1998: 140, Gowans 2003: 120-121, Malalasekera 1968: 72, and Werner 2007: 13; on the different nuances covered by dukkha cf. Hoffman 1987/1992: 27-45 and Schmithausen 1977). Thus, for
such contexts, it would be better to render dukkha as “unsatisfactory”, although I generally tend to simply use the Pāli term, without translating it (in fact Bailey 2003: 32 concludes that “dukkha is an untranslatable word connoting unsatisfactoriness, disillusionment, anxiety, physical pain and insecurity in every
possible modulation and dimension”). In regard to satipa��hāna, I understand this term to refer to the
“establishing of mindfulness”, deriving it from sati + upa��hāna; for a more detailed discussion cf. Anālayo 2003a: 29; cf. also Klaus 1993: 78, who translates satipa��hāna as “the standing near of attention”,
and [[AN4.202]] at AN II 218,29: attanā ca upa��hitasati hoti, parañ ca satipa��hāne samādapeti, which, as

confronted with the need to choose which details merit explicit treatment, in fact, nothing short of a complete translation of all versions could do full justice to all the similarities and variations found between the different versions of a discourse.
Ideally, a comparative study of the different versions of a discourse should proceed
by establishing a critical edition of all texts involved, followed by preparing synoptic
translations. In view of the broad scope of my study and the considerable number of
texts taken into consideration, to provide such critical editions and synoptic translations would require a lifetime of work and result in a publication of a size exceeding a
translation of the four Pāli Nikāyas. [10] Due to the restrictions that naturally result from
the compass of my research, the following pages can only give a first survey of the
material, an overview that is in need of being supplemented by more detailed studies of
each individual discourse.
Moreover, the original research on which the present publication is based was undertaken as an academic project that had to be completed within three years. This inevitably led to a number of errors and slips, caused by working on a large number of texts in
various languages within a short period of time. In the years that have passed since the
successful completion of this tour de force in 2007, I have revised my studies and hopefully been able to redress most of these errors, although time has not permitted me to
redo the whole research completely from the outset, hence it is to be expected that some
slips will have escaped me.
As part of the process of revision, I have also published a range of articles in which I
provide translations of selected discourses that, during the course of my research, had
attracted my attention. [11] Such studies provide a more precise picture of the particular
discourse in question than possible within the context of my present survey of a whole
collection in the light of its parallels.


Kuan 2008: 104 points out, provides a good basis for understanding the etymology of satipa��hāna, as in
this passage “satipa��hāna is evidently rephrasing upa��hitasati”; cf. also the Śrāvakabhūmi, ŚSG 2007:
180,13 (or Shukla 1973: 293,16): yā sūpasthitasm�titā, idam ucyate sm�ter upasthānam.
10 Although the scope of my research has made it impossible to establish a critical edition of each text,
when quoting passages from the Pāli discourses in a footnote I have attempted to note some of the variations (except for such variations as, e.g., between b and v) that are found in the Burmese (B [e] ), Ceylonese
(C [e] ), and Siamese (S [e] ) editions, in comparison with the PTS edition, on which I base myself. I did not
consult the Nā�andā edition, since according to Hamm 1962: 359 this mainly reproduces the Burmese
edition, with some additional variant readings. In regard to Chinese texts, I base myself on the CBETA
edition of the Taishō ( ). For Āgama discourses, I also consulted the Fó-guāng ( ) edition, which,
although being based on the Taishō, has the advantage of a superior punctuation and rich footnotes. In
the case of Sanskrit texts such as the Divyāvadāna or the Lalitavistara, etc., I provide references to the
early editions by Cowell, Lefmann, etc., and also to the new editions, in the hope that this will facilitate
quick finding of the relevant passage in whichever edition is more easily available to the reader (for the
same reason, for works of art I list several publications that at times have the same image). For Tibetan
texts, I have consulted the Derge (D) and the Peking (Q) editions. When quoting various text editions, I
have at times standardized, adjusted punctuation, etc., for the sake of conformity and better readability.

Preface   •   xxv


In sum, I am afraid that my work will not be able to satisfy high standards of precision, as it is not based on the in-depth understanding that results from translating all of
the consulted texts. Hence my study cannot replace, and is certainly not intended to replace, more detailed studies of each single discourse, which alone will be able to clarify the finer points and differences.
What my research does offer, however, could be compared to a picture taken with a
wide-angle lens. A wide-angle lens picture provides a comprehensive vision, yet at the
same time it has the inevitable drawback that smaller details do not stand out with the
clarity and precision that would result from a close-up. To use yet another image, my
present research is somewhat like fishing with a big meshed net. Even though smaller
‘fish’ will inevitably escape me, the big ‘fish’ that I bring home hopefully justify my
approach.
My research falls into the field of textual studies in early canonical Buddhism, in the
sense that it presents a comparative study of the legacy of discourse material preserved
by the reciters, the bhā�akas. [12] It is their presentation of the teachings that I am investigating, [13] based on considering their legacy as source material for early Buddhist thought
that deserves to be taken seriously. [14]


12 In order to reflect the oral nature of the discourses that are the objects of my study, I employ the term
“reciter” (bhā�aka) to refer to those who were responsible for their production and transmission. It seems
to me that, just as we would not refer to the Majjhima-nikāya as a “book” or to its discourses as “papers”,
similarly it would be preferable to avoid terms like “editors” or “redactors”. The discourses of the Majjhima-nikāya are not the final product of an editorial process of the type we are familiar with, or of the
activities of one or several redactors or authors, comparable to what we know from our modern day
publishing or reading experiences. Instead, these discourses came into being orally, their subsequent
function was within an entirely oral setting, and their transmission took place for centuries just by oral
means; cf. also the discussion in chapter 16.
13 Thus when using expressions such as, for example, ‘the Buddha said to Brahmā’, I certainly do not intend to convey that the historical Buddha certainly said so, nor do I postulate the existence of Brahmā.
Instead, I only intend to indicate that the reciters of the discourses report the Buddha to have spoken in a
certain way to Brahmā. It would become cumbersome reading if in every such instance I were to mention explicitly that I only represent the point of view of the discourses.
14 Bronkhorst 1998a: 12 suggests that “rather than rejecting beforehand the whole canon ... I propose ...

[that] in principle the canon preserves the teachings of the Buddha, but in practice certain ideas and
practices presented in it have to be discarded for specifiable reasons”. De Jong 1993: 21 and 25 explains
that “the fact that these texts were transmitted for centuries before being written down ... makes them ...
unreliable witnesses to historical events ... but they give us much information about the teachings of
early Buddhism”. According to him, “it would be hypercritical to assert that nothing can be said about
the doctrine of earliest Buddhism ... the basic ideas of Buddhism as found in the canonical writings
could very well have been proclaimed by him [the Buddha], transmitted and developed by his disciples
and, finally, codified in fixed formulas”. Frauwallner 1953: 465 voices his disagreement with those who
treat the canonical texts as totally unreliable, believing that nothing certain can be said about the teachings of the Buddha (“ebenso wenig kann ich mich aber auch der Auffassung anschließen, welche die
kanonische Überlieferung des Buddhismus für vollkommen unglaubwürdig hält und ... meint, daß es
aussichtslos sei, über die Lehre des Buddha selbst irgendetwas Sicheres ermitteln zu wollen”). He suggests that the transmitted texts are not unreliable merely because they are not confirmed by external


xxvi   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


In my attempt to comprehend early Buddhist thought, I approach the discourses on
their own terms. Here a key aspect seems to me to be that, in the thought world of the
early discourses, the principle of coherence is a central argument in debate situations. [15]
As soon as it can be shown that an earlier statement is not consistent with a later proposition, a position becomes untenable. [16]
Taking a lead from the principle of coherence evident in such contexts as a basic
element of early Buddhist thought, my present exploration is based on applying this
principle of coherence to the early discourses themselves. That is, inconsistencies
between various discourses or between different versions of a discourse are in need of
explanation, or else point to some problem in textual transmission. [17]
To approach the early discourses in this manner would be in accordance with the four
great standards (mahāpadesa) that the discourses themselves present as a means for
scriptural verification. [18] According to these four great standards, the consistency of a
particular text with other texts regarded as canonical is the criterion to be used to determine if this text can be considered as authentic. [19]


proofs (“überliefertes Quellenmaterial ist noch nicht unglaubwürdig, wenn die äußere Bezeugung fehlt”).
Those who nevertheless wish to reject the value of such material would according to him also have the
duty to explain and establish how this material has come into being (“wer sie [die kanonischen Texte]
aber trotzdem verwirft, darf sich nicht auf die bloße Verneinung beschränken, sondern hat die Pflicht,
auch ihr Zustandekommen zu erklären und zu begründen”). A more detailed discussion of the historical
value of the Pāli discourses will be forthcoming in Anālayo 2012e.
15 Jayatilleke 1963/1980: 334 points out that “in the Nikāyas, consistency is regarded as a criterion of
truth”, and Vetter 1988: ix sees no “reason for accepting ... inconsistency as a characteristic of” ancient
Buddhism; cf. also Watanabe 1983/1996: 74-75.
16 E.g., [[MN56]] at MN I 377,10: “your earlier [statement] does not fit with your later [statement], nor does
your later [statement] fit with your earlier [statement],” na kho te sandhīyati purimena vā pacchima�
pacchimena vā purima�, and its parallel [[MA133]] at T I 629b29: “[in regard to] what you said, the earlier deviates from the later, and the later deviates from the earlier, there is thus no correspondence,”
.
17 This would be in line with the methodological observations by Bronkhorst 2000b: 32 (or id. 2009: 8),
who suggests that contradictory positions need to be examined in order to see if one of them could be
due to the influence of external or later developments (although my criteria for considering something as
contradictory are not necessarily the same as his, cf. also the remark by Gethin 2004a: 209 that at times
“focusing on the divergent and incompatible in the early Buddhist accounts of the path and goal is a classic
instance of a failure to see the wood for the trees”). Reat 1996: 34 recommends that one should “assume
that the historical Buddha’s teaching were coherent, if not perhaps rigidly systematic, when they were
given. Therefore any reconstruction of these teachings should reveal a coherent framework of doctrine”.
Therefore, according to Schmithausen 1981: 200, “when there are instances of incoherence, they will
汝之所說, have to be taken seriously and will need to be explained (e.g., by reference to textual history ...) 前與後違, 後與前違, 則不相應 ”.
18 In the Pāli discourses, these four great standards are described in [[DN16]] at DN II 123,30 and [[AN4.180]]
at AN II 167,31; for a comparative study of these four cf. Lamotte 1947.
19 Tilakaratne 2000b: 14 explains that the delivery of the mahāpadesas is based on the premise “that what
is called Dhamma and Vinaya is characterised by internal consistence and coherence”; on the significance of the mahāpadesas cf. also, e.g., [[AN2002]]/2003, Cousins 1983: 2-3, Nimanong 2006: 82, and
Wynne 2004: 100-104, just to mention a few out of the range of publications on this topic.


Preface   •   xxvii


Ideas of coherence or consistency are, however, time- and culture-bound. Here I
think it is of relevance that ancient Indian thought knows a so-called ‘four-fold logic’,
the tetralemma. The four alternatives of this tetralemma are a recurrent feature in the
early Buddhist discourses, where they frequently occur in analytical expositions. Thus,
for example, four types of person are distinguished into those that:

 - torment themselves,

 - torment others,

 - torment both,

 - torment neither.
Another example is when four modes of action are treated under the headings of being:

 - dark action,

 - bright action,

 - dark-and-bright action,

 - neither-dark-nor-bright action. [20]
When applying ideas of coherence or consistency to early Buddhist thought, I think
this four-fold approach needs to be kept in mind. Of particular relevance is the third
possibility envisaged by the tetralemma, according to which differences need not always be contradictory, but can also be complementary. That is, propositions that at first
sight seem to conflict with each other might on closer inspection turn out to tally. [21]
Another aspect of considerable importance for a proper assessment of the early discourses is the oral nature of their transmission. In order to provide some background to
this oral nature, in what follows I survey oral aspects of the Majjhima-nikāya and of its
discourses. I come back to the theme of oral transmission in the concluding chapter of
my study, where based on the findings of modern psychological research on textual
memory I attempt to develop a clearer idea of the dynamics of the early Buddhist oral
tradition and of the processes that appear to have been responsible for the variations
found between different versions of a discourse.


20 [[MN51]] at MN I 341,2 and [[MN57]] at MN I 389,21, cf. below pp. 309 and 333; cf. also the discussion in,
e.g., Hoffman 1982 and Sturm 1996: 53-63.
21 To allow for this possibility might offer a helpful perspective on some of the ‘problems’ of early Buddhist philosophy. A case in point would be the much-discussed variants to the twelve-link presentation
of dependent arising, pa�icca samuppāda, that involve less than twelve links. Instead of considering
these as problematic, perhaps such variants could just be seen as different applications of the same basic
principle of dependent arising (cf. [[SN12.20]] at SN II 26,4), which can express itself ‘in terms of’ the
twelve links and ‘not in terms of’ the twelve-links. The result of applying the third possibility from the
tetralemma scheme in this way would be in line with a conclusion arrived at by Jones 2009a: 34 in his
recent research on the early Buddhist doctrine of dependent arising, which according to him “may have
been understood as consisting not in a definite number of dependently-arisen terms, but as a flexible
mode of presentation using five, nine, ten or twelve links”. Therefore, “rather than asking how the
twelve-fold formulation came to be constituted from smaller units, the historical problem should be reframed as that of explaining how it came to be regarded as standard”.


Introduction: The Majjhima-nikāya

The Majjhima-nikāya, the “middle [length] collection”, takes its name from the intermediate length of nearly all of the discourses collected in this second of the four Pāli Nikāyas. [22] The Majjhima-nikāya assembles its one-hundred-fifty-two discourses in fifteen
chapters, grouped into three main subdivisions, three sets of “fifty”. While fourteen out
of these fifteen chapters have ten discourses each, one chapter has twelve discourses.
Due to this chapter with twelve discourses, the last of these three main subdivisions has
fifty-two discourses, even though its title is uparipa��āsa, “final fifty”. [23]
Regarding these three “fifties”, although their contents cannot be neatly set apart from
each other, a closer investigation reveals some differences among them. [24] Thus in the first
set of fifty, a monk or a group of monks make up the audience in over seventy per cent
of the discourses, and in the final fifty the same is the case for close to ninety per cent of
the discourses (including one discourse spoken to nuns). In the middle fifty, only about
twenty-five per cent of the discourses are addressed to a monk or a group of monks, even
though one of the five subdivisions of this fifty is a “chapter on monks”, Bhikkhu-vagga,
entirely spoken to monks.
In the first set of fifty, Sāriputta is the author of most of the discourses spoken by disciples, followed by Mahāmoggallāna. [25] In the middle fifty, Ānanda is the most prominent
speaker of discourses spoken by disciples, followed by Sāriputta. [26] In the final fifty, Sāriputta and Ānanda are the speakers of the same number of discourses. [27] While in the first

number of discourses found in the present collection. However, the “long collection”, Dīgha-nikāya, counts
only thirty-four discourses, so that on this interpretation the “long” collection should rather be called the
“short” collection, as it has the least number of discourses. Moreover, the other two Nikāyas receive their
name from the type of discourse they contain, this being either discourses collected according to topic
(sa�yutta) or according to numerical principles (a�guttara), titles not related to the quantity of discourses
these collections contain.

into account discourses that are attributed as a whole to a particular monk, not discourses where a monk
plays a secondary role by making a shorter remark or asking a question, etc., Mahāmoggallāna’s role in
[[MN37]] seems to be rather central.

set of fifty Ānanda never features as the author of a discourse, Mahāmoggallāna does not
appear as the speaker of any of the discourses among the middle and final fifties.
A to some degree distinct character of each of the three fifties is also reflected in their
respective settings. In the first set of fifty, the Jeta’s Grove monologue given by the Buddha to an unspecified number of monks is by far the most frequent type of setting, [28] whereas the same is completely absent from the middle fifty, whose discourses almost entirely
consist of dialogues. [29] In the final fifty the Jeta’s Grove monologue given by the Buddha
to the monks recurs again with almost the same frequency as in the first set of fifty. [30]
The middle fifty also stands out for containing more verse material than the other two
fifties. [31] The chapter headings of the middle fifty further set it apart from the other two
fifties, as in the middle fifty each chapter is consistently named after the type of audience
to which its discourses are spoken. Thus the chapters of the middle fifty are on:

 - householders,

 - monks,

 - wanderers,

 - kings,

 - Brahmins. [32]
In contrast, the chapter headings in the first fifty and in the final fifty vary, being based
on one of the following principles:

 - the discourse that stands at the beginning of the chapter, [33]

 - a particular theme treated in this chapter, [34]

 - the grouping principle applied in the chapter. [35]

31 Although the number of discourses in which verses are found is distributed in an ascending manner over
the three fifties, with six discourses in the first fifty that contain verse ([[MN7]] [[MN12]] [[MN26]] [[MN34]]
[[MN49]] and [[MN50]]), eight discourses in the middle fifty ([[MN53]] [[MN56]] [[MN75]] [[MN82]] [[MN86]] [[MN91]] [[MN92]] and [[MN98]]), and nine discourses in the final fifty ([[MN116]] [[MN128]] [[MN130]] [[MN131]] [[MN132]] [[MN133]] [[MN134]] [[MN142]] and [[MN143]]), the verse sections in the middle fifty are rather long, so
that in terms of overall percentage the middle fifty has about 53% of the verse material found in the Majjhima-nikāya as a whole, while the first fifty has about 14% and the final fifty about 33%. For a concordance of Majjhima-nikāya verses cf. Franke 1912.
32 These are the Gahapati-vagga (6th chapter), the Bhikkhu-vagga (7th), the Paribbājaka-vagga (8th), the
Rāja-vagga (9 [th] ), and the Brāhma�a-vagga (10 [th] ).
33 The Mūlapariyāya-vagga (1st chapter), the Sīhanāda-vagga (2nd), the Devadaha-vagga (11th), the Anupada-vagga (12 [th] ), and the Suññata-vagga (13 [th] ) appear to take their title from the first discourse found in
each chapter. Von Hinüber 1998: 108 notes that the same principle is also found frequently in the Jātaka
collection, where vaggas tend to be titled after the first tale that occurs in them.
34 The Sa�āyatana-vagga (15th chapter) appears to take its title from the theme treated in the discourses collected under this heading.


Introduction   •   3


The different character of the three fifties can also be seen by surveying the way some
themes are treated in them. While among the first set of fifty comprehensive instructions
on mindfulness can be found in the Satipa��hāna-sutta, [36] the final fifty takes up aspects
of satipa��hāna practice – mindfulness of breathing, mindfulness of the body, and the
four noble truths – and dedicates a whole discourse to exploring each of these three aspects in additional detail. [37]
Again, while discourses in the first set of fifty offer autobiographical information on
the Buddha’s pre-awakening experiences as a bodhisattva, [38] the second set of fifty takes
up the same from a broader temporal perspective, as it includes canonical Jātakas, descriptions of the bodhisattva’s previous lives. [39]
A progression from basic instructions to a more detailed presentation can to some extent also be discerned in relation to teachings on insight. [40] Prominent among the range of
insight-related instructions found in the first set of fifty are the treatments of the senses
and of perceptual experience provided in the Mūlapariyāya-sutta and in the Madhupi��ika-sutta. [41] The theme broached by these two discourses is examined in more detail in a
set of ten discourses dedicated to the sense-spheres and found in the Sa�āyatana-vagga,
the last chapter in the Majjhima-nikāya.
Another progression can be seen in the description of the conduct of a monk. [42] Several
discourses in the first set of fifty tackle this theme by indicating how a monk can become
a true heir of the Dharma; how a monk should overcome blemishes or practise efface
35 A grouping principle appears to be responsible for the title of the Opamma-vagga (3rd chapter, adopting
the chapter title found in the Burmese, Ceylonese, and Siamese editions, while the PTS edition reads Tatiya-vagga), Mahāyamaka-vagga (4 [th] ), Cū�ayamaka-vagga (5 [th] ), and of the Vibha�ga-vagga (14 [th] ).

40 The importance of insight-related topics throughout the Majjhima-nikāya is reflected in Ps V 109,6, which
in its concluding remark speaks of the whole collection as mahāvipassanā nāmāyan ti vutto.
41 [[MN1]] and [[MN18]]
42 The frequent discussions of the conduct of a monk seem to reflect an overall emphasis in the Majjhimanikāya collection on monastic training. Bailey 2003: 131 notes that Majjhima-nikāya discourses “convey a
highly didactic Buddhism ... these are teachings extending far beyond the understanding or interest of all
but the most highly sophisticated devotee”. Franke 1915 draws attention to the considerably more frequent
use of terminology related to vi + √nī or √sikkh in Majjhima-nikāya discourses, compared to Dīgha-nikāya
discourses. Manné 1990: 79-81 explains that while the Dīgha-nikāya collection appears to serve the function of gaining converts and lay supporters (cf. also Franke 1913b: 201, who qualifies the Dīgha-nikāya as
a propaganda text, “Propagandaschrift”), the purpose of the Majjhima-nikāya appears to be “the integration of new monks into the community and into the practice”, as “all of the technicalities of the Teaching
appear here in detail” and a number of “sermons on problems connected with the practice and its difficulty” can be found. Thus, while the Dīgha-nikāya is more a “collection of publicity material” for the purpose of conversion, the Majjhima-nikāya provides the converts “with the fundamentals of the Teaching
and the Practice”. Marasinghe 2002a: 565 also observes that “the majority of the discourses of this collection are ... either directly addressed to the ordained disciples ... or are otherwise intended for them”.

ment; what makes a monk easy to admonish; under what conditions a monk should remain in a particular place; and what makes a monk a true recluse. [43] The theme of the
conduct of a monk recurs in the second and third sets of fifty from a more detailed and
Vinaya-related perspective, with three discourses among the middle fifty dedicated to the
regulation on eating only at the allowable time, [44] and two discourses among the final
fifty laying down procedures to ensure communal harmony after the Buddha’s demise. [45]
In sum, the discourses collected in the first set of fifty appear to have a predominantly
foundational role, those found in the middle fifty seem to be more narrative, and a number of discourses found in the final fifty are more analytical. Although these are mere
tendencies and not organisational principles strictly carried out, the net result is that to
some extent the three fifties seem to follow a pattern in which each subdivision builds
upon the material that precedes it. [46]
This pattern could be due to the exigencies of oral transmission. According to the Visuddhimagga, the three fifties were the three main units for memorization of the Majjhima-nikāya and were to be learnt by a prospective reciter one after the other in succession.
That is, the reciters would at first memorize the first fifty, and only when this was accomplished would they turn to the middle fifty, and only when these had been successfully committed to memory would they learn the final fifty. [47] According to the commentary on the Vinaya, a monk who wants to become a reciter of the Majjhima-nikāya needs
to memorize at the very least the first set of fifty. [48] From this it would follow that the first
set of fifty is the minimum that needs to be learned, to which then the middle and the
final fifty could be added. Although these descriptions stem from commentarial works,
they may well reflect ancient patterns among reciters.
The subdivision into three fifties could then be understood to reflect differences in the
memory skills of those who wish to become reciters of the Majjhima-nikāya. Reciters of
limited talent in memorization may only learn the first fifty, as suggested in the Vinaya
commentary. In view of this it would only be natural for the first set of fifty to collect
discourses that cover the most essential themes required for a monk’s training and practice, in order to ensure that even those who learn only the first fifty will be provided with
expositions on the most important matters.

Reciters with more abilities might then continue and learn also the second fifty. Having
learned two fifties would enable them to take up preaching on a broader scale. This might
be the underlying rationale for the five chapters assembled in the second fifty, which
collect discourses spoken to householders, monks, wanderers, kings, and Brahmins.
These five groups are the types of audience that a reciter would address when preaching,
so that learning this second set of fifty would provide a selection of discourses related to
each of these groups, as occasion demands.
Reciters who train further and become full-fledged Majjhima-nikāya-bhā�akas, in the
sense of memorizing all one-hundred-and-fifty-two discourses, would also have at their
disposal the more detailed treatments on meditation practice and insight provided in the
discourses collected under the third fifty. This would enable such a reciter to be not only
a popular preacher, but also to act as a teacher for more advanced disciples and guide
them in their practice. In this way, the division into three fifties appears to be well suited
to the exigencies of oral transmission.
The pattern that appears to underlie the division of the Majjhima-nikāya into three parts
could have been the outcome of a gradual growth and shaping of this collection and need
not have been the ground plan of the collection right from the outset. In fact, some degree
of gradual evolution of the Majjhima-nikāya collection can be seen in the distribution of
discourses over the various chapters.
Closer inspection shows that the principle of distribution into chapters according to
topic has not been adopted throughout the Majjhima-nikāya in a consistent way. Even
though the fourth and fifth chapters (the Mahāyamaka-vagga and the Cū�ayamaka-vagga)
are devoted to “pairs”, the final part of the fifth chapter no longer contains pairs. [49] Yet,
among the remaining discourses in the Majjhima-nikāya a considerable number of pairs
can be found, so that there would have been enough material to fill this chapter with
pairs and make its content agree with its title. [50]
Concerning these pairs, it is also notable that they do not occur in a standard sequence,
since out of seventeen pairs found in the Majjhima-nikāya, nine pairs have the cū�a-version first, [51] while the other eight pairs list first the respective mahā-version. [52]


49 The first two discourses, the Sāleyyaka-sutta ([[MN41]]) and the Verañjaka-sutta ([[MN42]]), are so similar in
content that they can also be reckoned as a pair, but the final four discourses, the Vīma�saka-sutta ([[MN47]]), the Kosambiya-sutta ([[MN48]]), the Brahmanimanta�ika-sutta ([[MN49]]), and the Māratajjanīya-sutta
([[MN50]]) do not constitute “pairs”.
50 Other pairs in the Majjhima-nikāya are the Cū�asīhanāda-sutta ([[MN11]]) and the Mahāsīhanāda-sutta ([[MN12]]), the Mahādukkhakkhandha-sutta ([[MN13]]) and the Cū�adukkhakkhandha-sutta ([[MN14]]), the Cū�ahatthipadopama-sutta ([[MN27]]) and the Mahāhatthipadopama-sutta ([[MN28]]), the Mahāsāropama-sutta
([[MN29]]) and the Cū�asāropama-sutta ([[MN30]]), the Mahārāhulovāda-sutta ([[MN62]]) and the Cū�arāhulovāda-sutta ([[MN147]]), the Cū�amālu�kya-sutta ([[MN63]]) and the Mahāmālu�kya-sutta ([[MN64]]), the
Mahāsakuludāyi-sutta ([[MN77]]) and the Cū�asakuludāyi-sutta ([[MN79]]), the Mahāpu��ama-sutta ([[MN109]]) and the Cū�apu��ama-sutta ([[MN110]]), the Cū�asuññata-sutta ([[MN121]]) and the Mahāsuññata-sutta
([[MN122]]), and the Cū�akammavibha�ga-sutta ([[MN135]]) and the Mahākammavibha�ga-sutta ([[MN136]]).

The sixth chapter on householders (Gahapati-vagga) contains a discourse spoken to
ascetics, the Kukkuravatika-sutta, which does not seem to bear any relation to householders. [53] The same discourse could have found a better placing in the chapter on wanderers (Paribbājaka-vagga), which at present contains a discourse spoken to a householder (who had just come from meeting a wanderer), the Sama�ama��ikā-sutta. [54] Here
a simple exchange of the two discourses would have done better justice to the respective
chapter headings.
In the same sixth chapter on householders (Gahapati-vagga) one also finds a discourse
spoken to a prince, the Abhayarājakumāra-sutta. [55] This discourse could have found a
more suitable placing in the chapter on kings (Rāja-vagga), which already has another
discourse addressed to a prince, the Bodhirājakumāra-sutta. [56] The chapter on kings also
has a discourse whose main protagonist is a householder, the Gha�īkāra-sutta. [57] Hence in
this case, too, an exchange of the two discourses, by placing the Abhayarājakumāra-sutta in the chapter on kings and the Gha�īkāra-sutta in the chapter on householders, would
have better suited the respective chapter headings.
Even the allocation of discourses to the Majjhima-nikāya does not seem to invariably
follow a strict principle. Some discourses, such as the Mahāsīhanāda-sutta and the Mahāsakuludāyi-sutta, are rather long and could well have found a suitable placing in the
Dīgha-nikāya. [58] On the other hand, the discourses collected in the final chapter of the
Majjhima-nikāya are quite brief when compared to the average length of a middle long
discourse. As they all deal with the sense-spheres, it almost seems as if this chapter were
an extract from the Salāyatana-vagga of the Sa�yutta-nikāya. [59]
The examples surveyed so far do not give the impression that the arrangement of discourses in the Majjhima-nikāya is the result of a preconceived fixed plan that was carried
out with thorough precision. Instead, this arrangement appears more likely to be the outcome of a gradual process of development.
The impression of a gradual process of development becomes even more prominent
when the Majjhima-nikāya is compared with its counterpart in the Madhyama-āgama. [60]
This Madhyama-āgama collection was translated towards the end of the fourth century
into Chinese by the Kashmirian monk Gautama Sa�ghadeva, [61] a translation based on a
written Indic original read out by another Kashmirian monk and carried out in coopera

tion with three Chinese collaborators. [62] The Indic original used for this translation appears to have been in a Prākrit, [63] and is generally held to be stemming from a Sarvāstivāda line of transmission. [64]
The Madhyama-āgama contains more discourses than the Majjhima-nikāya, namely
two-hundred-and-twenty-two, which are assigned to eighteen chapters. Each of these
chapters includes a minimum of ten discourses, although a few chapters have considerably more. Regarding the chapter division in the two collections, the Madhyamaāgama and the Majjhima-nikāya have only the following four chapters in common:

 - on kings,

 - on Brahmins,

 - on pairs,

 - on analyses (vibha�ga).
These chapters occur, however, at different places in the two collections. [65] The contents of these four chapters also differ considerably in the respective collections. As il
62 The colophon to the Madhyama-āgama collection at T I 809b26 (cf. also Chen 2005: 612, T 2145 at T LV
64a13, and for Uighur fragments corresponding to this colophon Kudara 1990: 144-145) reports that the
Kashmirian monk Sa�gharak�a read out the original text, Sa�ghadeva translated it, and the monk Dàocí
acted as the scribe with the assistance of Lĭbăo and Kānghuà from the Wú state,
(with a variant reading for
the last as ). On the implications of the expression, literally “receiving with the pen”, cf. T 2131
at T LIV 1067c15, Fuchs 1930: 88, Shih 1968: 90: 167, and Zacchetti 2006: 166 note 41; regarding the reference to the original as, cf. the discussion by Boucher 2000. Zacchetti 1996: 352 notes that Chinese
translations undertaken during this period were the outcome of a tripartite group effort that involved a
principal translator, an interpreter, and redactor(s). Regarding the characteristics of such translation teams,
Hrdličková 1958: 134 explains that “the translator – a foreigner – usually translated the original text into
Chinese orally, while Chinese scribes corrected his Chinese and put down his translation into writing”.

explains that the Madhyama-āgama 胡本 translated into Chinese probably represents the earliest of three versions of this collection, the second of the three being the version partly preserved in some Central Asian
Sanskrit fragments, and the third version being reflected in discourse quotations in later works. For a survey of some features of the Madhyama-āgama cf. also Anālayo 2007b, id. 2008a, and id. 2009B.
65 The “chapter on kings” (Rāja-vagga) forms the ninth chapter in the Majjhima-nikāya, while in the Madhyama-āgama it occurs as the sixth chapter ( ). The “chapter on Brahmins” (Brāhma�a-vagga) is the
tenth chapter in the Majjhima-nikāya, while in the Madhyama-āgama it constitutes the twelfth chapter
( ). The Majjhima-nikāya has two “chapters on pairs” (Mahā- and Cū�ayamaka-vagga), which are
its fourth and fifth chapters respectively, while the Madhyama-āgama has only one “chapter on pairs”
( ), which occurs in this collection as the fifteenth chapter. The “chapter on analyses” (Vibha�ga-vagga) is the fourteenth chapter in the Majjhima-nikāya, while in the Madhyama-āgama it occurs as the thirteenth ( ); cf. also Yìnshùn 1971/1983: 707. In addition to these, the third chapter of the Majjhima-nikāya, which in the Burmese, Ceylonese and Siamese editions is entitled “chapter on similes”

In fact, most of the discourses in the Majjhima-nikāya and in the Madhyama-āgama
are arranged in rather different ways. These differences support the impression that the
location of the discourses was the outcome of a process specific to each of the two collections, although the similarities shown in table 0.1 above could be the remnants of a
common starting-point. [66]
The same argument applies not only to the Madhyama-āgama parallels to Majjhimanikāya discourses, but also to the Chinese parallels to the Majjhima-nikāya found in the
other Āgamas. A number of such parallels to Majjhima-nikāya discourses occur in the
Sa�yukta-āgama, which was translated in the fifth century into Chinese by Bǎoyún (
), based on what seems to have been a (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda text recited by the Indian
monk Gu�abhadra, a text that may have been brought to China from Sri Lanka by Fǎxiǎn
( ). [67] An even more prominent source for parallels to Majjhima-nikāya discourses is

ples” or “illustrations” ( ), although the two do not share any discourse in common. Anesaki 1934a: 284
sums up that “the methods of division into chapters and the order of successive dialogues are quite different” in the two collections.
66 In a similar vein, in regard to the Sa�yutta-nikāya and Sa�yukta-āgama collections Glass 2007: 27 comes
to the conclusion that while the “shared principle of arrangement is likely to be very old, important differ- 寶
雲 ences between the content and arrangement of the extant versions show that they followed separate developments”. Norman 1984/1992: 40 explains that “the sects ... had the same names for the groups of texts,
but were not yet in general agreement about their contents, or the order of the contents”.

the Ekottarika-āgama, a collection apparently translated by Zhú Fóniàn ( ) from
what seems to have been a Prākrit original of so far undetermined school affiliation transmitted by the Tocharian monk Dharmanandī. [68]
Of these Āgamas, the majority of full parallels to Majjhima-nikāya discourses are
found in the Madhyama-āgama, which has ninety-six parallels and therewith more parallels than the other main Āgamas together. [69] The Ekottarika-āgama has thirty-six full
parallels, [70] followed by the Sa�yukta-āgama (T 99) with twenty-five full parallels, [71]

Ceylon cf. Bechert 1982, id. 1998: 3, Gunawardana 1966: 66, Kalupahana 1970: 190, and Witanachchi
2005c: 578. I use the somewhat cumbersome expression “(Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda” to reflect my uncertainty
regarding this tradition’s relationship to, or perhaps identity with, the Sarvāstivāda tradition; for a recent
contribution to this theme cf. Enomoto 2000, cf. also Skilling 2002: 374-376, with a reply in Wynne 2008.
68 For a more detailed discussion of the somewhat complex issue of the translator and school affiliation of
the Ekottarika-āgama cf. Anālayo 2009A; cf. also Nattier 2010 for a revealing study of Zhú Fóniàn (
), the probable translator of this collection (on this attribution cf. Matsumura 1989: 361-367; cf. also,
e.g., Anālayo 2006e: 146, Legittimo 2010: 256, and Nattier 2007: 195 note 48). Regarding the title of this
Āgama, Allon 2001: 11 lists several occurrences of the term Ekottarika-āgama in Sanskrit sources, cf. also
Baums 2009: 513, whereas the alternative expression Ekottara-āgama does not seem to be attested, which
makes me prefer the term “Ekottarika-āgama” for rendering .

such parallels are as important as other Āgama discourses when it comes to studying a particular Pāli discourse in the light of its counterparts, the fact that this collection is not preserved in full makes it impossible to assess how many parallels it would have had to Majjhima-nikāya discourses.

while the Dīrgha-āgama has only a single parallel. [72] Among these one-hundred-fiftyeight full parallels to discourses of the Majjhima-nikāya found in the main Chinese
Āgamas, a considerable degree of overlap occurs, in that at times two or even three
Āgama parallels to a single Pāli discourse can be found, while some Majjhima-nikāya
discourses do not have any full parallel in the Chinese Āgamas (though they may have
partial parallels in a Chinese Āgamas discourses or counterparts in discourses that have
been translated individually into Chinese). [73]
While the Majjhima-nikāya has only a single parallel in the Chinese Dīrgha-āgama, a
collection translated by Zhú Fóniàn ( ) based on a text recited by Buddhayaśas during the early fifth century from what seems to have been a Prākrit original transmitted by
the Dharmaguptaka tradition, [74] the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Dīrgha-āgama preserved in Sanskrit fragments appears to have had ten parallels to the Majjhima-nikāya. [75] For such dif

72 [[DA30]].4 (though the relevant portion is part of a larger discourse, from the perspective of the Majjhima-nikāya it is a full parallel to [[MN130]]).
73 For a survey of the parallels to each Majjhima-nikāya discourse and a brief discussion of the distinction
between partial and full parallels cf. below p. 1037.
74 On the school affiliation of the Dīrgha-āgama 竺佛念 cf., eg., Bareau 1966: 50, Brough 1962/2001: 50, Demiéville 1951: 252-253, Enomoto 1986: 25, Lü 1963: 242, Mayeda 1985: 97, Oberlies 2003: 44, Prasad 1993:
50, Salomon 1999: 173, and Yìnshùn 1971/1983: 720, cf. also Anālayo 2009o: 229 note 65; on its original
language cf. Brough 1962/2001: 50-54, Karashima 1994, and Waldschmidt 1980a: 137. Regarding translation activities associated with Buddhayaśas cf. Bagchi 1927: 203; on his probable role during translation
cf. Silk 2006: 81-82; on the translators cf., e.g., T I 1b10, T 2059 at T L 334b20 (translated in Shih 1968:
90), and T 2145 at T LV 11b1. Forte 1984: 316 comments that every translation was “registered under the
name of a single person, usually the actual guarantor of the text, either because he had brought the Sanskrit
text to China or else because he knew it by heart ... This need to make one person responsible often meant
that the actual contribution of other members of the team tended to be unacknowledged”; cf. also Boucher
1998: 500 note 121. The need for a guarantor of the translated text is quite understandable in view of the
fact that, as Lancaster 1999: 519 and 523 points out, “instead of a previously arranged canon, the Chinese
received one text after another ... in a piecemeal fashion”, “there was no list of texts, universally recognized by the arriving missionary monks, which could be used by the early Chinese Buddhist community as
a formal canon”. Thus, as summed up by Nattier 2008: 19 “in many cases a scripture is credited not to the
actual translator, but to the foreign participant in the translation process, even if that person’s only role ...
was to provide a written text and/or to recite the scripture aloud”.
75 Besides what I have been able to consult of these recently discovered Dīrgha-āgama fragments, for my
comparative studies I have also drawn on a number of other Sanskrit fragments that parallel at times
smaller and at times large sections of Majjhima-nikāya discourses. In general, the school affiliation of
such Sanskrit fragment parallels is uncertain, although the possibility that they stem from the Sarvāstivāda/
(Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda traditions could be considered the most probable option, cf. also Hartmann 1999:
119. Another important source of parallels is Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya
(on this work cf. also Mejor 1991: 63-64 and Skilling 2005: 699), a discourse anthology extant in Tibetan
translation and stemming from the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda tradition, this being the standard school affiliation
of texts preserved in Tibetan, cf. Bu ston’s “History of Buddhism” in Obermiller 1932/1986: 197 and, e.g.,
Grönbold 1984: 14 or Ruegg 1985: 121. This work contains a number of partial and full parallels to Majjhima-nikāya discourses, where the relevant passages can conveniently be located thanks to Honjō 1984,
with Pāsādika 1989a providing a survey of quotations in the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya.


Introduction   •   11


ferences to manifest, the distribution of discourses over different collections must have
fluctuated for quite some time during oral transmission, so that various reciter traditions
felt free to adapt it to their personal needs and preferences. [76]
Thus the positioning of discourses (and of chapters) in the Majjhima-nikāya clearly differs from its Chinese parallel. Another aspect of the same collection is the order of its
discourses, which at times appears to follow an underlying rationale that expresses the
exigencies of oral transmission.
A closer inspection of the sequence of discourses in the Majjhima-nikāya reveals that a
preceding discourse tends to have some aspect in common with the next discourse, thereby providing a link that makes it easy for the reciters to remember which discourse comes
next. Such linking or “concatenation” can take various forms and involve content as well
as form. [77]
The working mechanics of such concatenation can be illustrated with the example of
the first ten discourses in the Majjhima-nikāya. [78] The first and second discourses, the
Mūlapariyāya-sutta ([[MN1]]) and the Sabbāsava-sutta ([[MN2]]), both begin their respective
treatment by examining the case of the untaught ordinary worldling, [79] and proceed from
this to the liberated monk who has gone beyond the influxes and fetters, a similarity in
pattern that easily provides a relation between the two discourses. [80]
The Sabbāsava-sutta ([[MN2]]) instructs how to eradicate the influxes, a topic that recurs
right away at the beginning of the third discourse in the Majjhima-nikāya, the Dhamma
76 Cf. also below p. 864.
77 Von Hinüber 1999a: 20 (cf. also id. 1996/1997: 12) notes as an example for concatenation the sequence of
pācittiya rules of the pātimokkha, where rule 4 refers to teaching recitation to someone who has not been
fully ordained, anupasampanna�; rule 5 takes up the issue of lying down in the presence of someone who
has not been fully ordained, anupasampannena ... sahaseyya� kapeyya; rule 6 then turns to lying down in
the presence of a woman, mātugāmena sahaseyya� kappeyya; rule 7 then turns to teaching the Dharma to
women, mātugāmassa (cf., e.g., Ñā�adassana 1993: 31). Thus in each case a particular expression found in
the earlier rule is taken up in the subsequent rule. On concatenation between discourses cf. also Allon 2001:
18-22.
78 My exposition takes its inspiration from a study of the interrelation between Majjhima-nikāya discourses in
Franke 1914a, which covers the remaining discourses up to [[MN76]] (on [[MN92]] and [[MN98]] cf. Franke
1914c; for similar patterns in the Dīgha-nikāya cf. Franke 1913c). Extracts of the present discussion already appeared in Anālayo 2010m.

sabbāsavasa�varasa�vuto ... vāvattayi sa�yojana� (B [e] -MN I 15,7 and S [e] -MN I 20,12: vivattayi). Another link between the two discourses could be that [[MN1]] at MN I 6,13 describes the penetrative vision of
the Tathāgata that goes beyond a worldling’s conceivings by proclaiming sabbaso ta�hāna� khayā ... anuttara� sammāsambodhi� abhisambuddho, thereby broaching the theme of the proper vision of phenomena that comes about with full awakening, a theme taken up at the beginning of [[MN2]] at MN I 7,4 in terms
of the need to develop knowledge and vision for being able to reach full awakening, jānato ... passato āsavāna� khaya� vadāmi. To develop such knowledge and vision, [[MN2]] recommends yoniso manasikāra,
the very opposite of the worldling’s conceivings mentioned in [[MN1]]


12   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


dāyāda-sutta ([[MN3]]), which criticizes monks who do not eradicate those things that their
teacher told them to eradicate. [81]
Another aspect of proper conduct highlighted in the Dhammadāyāda-sutta ([[MN3]]) is
the need to dwell in seclusion, [82] a topic that forms the central theme of the next discourse,
the Bhayabherava-sutta ([[MN4]]), which expounds the difficulties of living in seclusion.
The interrelation between the two discourses is further strengthened by the circumstance
that in the Dhammadāyāda-sutta ([[MN3]]) the monks who practise seclusion function as a
shining example, [83] just as in the Bhayabherava-sutta ([[MN4]]) the Buddha’s practice of seclusion functions as a shining example for his disciples. [84]
In the context of its examination of the difficulties of living in seclusion, the Bhayabherava-sutta ([[MN4]]) describes the obstructive effect of various evil mental qualities, a
theme continued in the next discourse, the Ana�gana-sutta ([[MN5]]), by examining various evil mental qualities of a monk. The relationship between the two discourses is further strengthened by the fact that several evil qualities mentioned in the Bhayabheravasutta ([[MN4]]) recur in the description of evil monks given at the conclusion of the Ana�gana-sutta ([[MN5]]). [85]
The Ana�gana-sutta ([[MN5]]) examines unworthy wishes of a monk and highlights the
importance of making an effort to overcome them. The next discourse, the Āka�kheyyasutta ([[MN6]]), takes up the same theme from the complementary perspective of the
worthy wishes of a monk, explaining how effort should be directed in order for such
wishes to come to fulfilment. The two treatments even have a partial overlap, as both
take up the case of a monk who wishes to obtain food and clothing, etc. [86]


81 [[MN2]] at MN I 7,10 presents seven modes how the influxes should be eradicated, āsavā pahātabbā. [[MN3]]
at MN I 14,14 then continues this theme with yesañ ca dhammāna� satthā pahānam āha, te ca dhamme
nappajahanti. [[MN3]] at MN I 15,25 develops the idea of eradication by describing that the noble eightfold
path leads to the eradication of various mental defilements, lobhassa ca pahānāya dosassa ca pahānāya
atthi majjhima pa�ipadā ... ayam eva ariyo a��ha�giko maggo. By referring to the noble eightfold path,
[[MN3]] continues the theme of the path to the eradication of dukkha mentioned in [[MN2]] at MN I 9,19: aya�
dukkhanirodhagāminī pa�ipadā, where this path is also related to eradication, as it occurs in the exposition
of influxes to be eradicated through vision, āsavā dassanā pahātabbā.
82 [[MN3]] at MN I 14,2 contrasts disciples who do not follow their teacher’s example and do not practise seclusion, satthu pavivittassa viharato, sāvakā viveka� nānusikkhanti, with disciples who follow the example of their teacher, sāvakā vivekam anusikkhanti.
83 [[MN3]] at MN I 15,4: paviveke pubba�gamā.
84 [[MN4]] at MN I 16,22: gotamo pubba�gamo. The two discourses also have in common that they mention
the Buddha’s compassion, [[MN3]] at MN I 12,15: atthi me tumhesu anukampā, and [[MN4]] at MN I 23,35:
pacchimañ ca janata� anukampamāno.

Introduction   •   13


The series of worthy wishes in the Āka�kheyya-sutta ([[MN6]]) leads from going beyond
unwholesome states of mind, via the attainment of stream-entry, to the attainment of full
awakening. The next discourse, the Vatthūpama-sutta ([[MN7]]), takes up the same topics,
as it first treats a series of unwholesome mental states, then refers to the attainment of
stream-entry, and finally culminates in the attainment of the destruction of the influxes.
The Vatthūpama-sutta ([[MN7]]), moreover, completes the topic of requisites that was already a theme in the two preceding discourses. While the Ana�gana-sutta ([[MN5]]) describes a monk’s wish for superior food and clothing, etc., and the Āka�kheyya-sutta
([[MN6]]) shows how a monk’s wish for food and clothing can be fulfilled, the Vatthūpama-sutta ([[MN7]]) concludes this topic by indicating that for one who has developed the
path, even superior type of food will not be an obstruction. [87]
The Vatthūpama-sutta ([[MN7]]) and the next discourse, the Sallekha-sutta ([[MN8]]), base
their respective expositions on what needs to be overcome in order to progress on the path.
The relationship between these two discourses is so close in this respect that they both
list the same mental defilements. [88]
The Sallekha-sutta ([[MN8]]) takes up the transcendence of views, [89] a theme the next discourse, the Sammādi��hi-sutta ([[MN9]]), develops from its complementary perspective by
exploring various aspects of right view. This theme is already adumbrated in the Sallekha-sutta’s ([[MN8]]) reference to right view as the way to overcome wrong view. [90]
The Sammādi��hi-sutta’s ([[MN9]]) treatment revolves around various aspects that one
should “know”, pajānāti, in order to accomplish right view. The need to “know” is also
the theme of the next discourse, the Satipa��hāna-sutta ([[MN10]]), where the same activity
is mentioned again and again in the descriptions of how to develop the four satipa��hānas.
Both discourses thus share in common that they expound how one factor of the noble
eightfold path can be developed with the help of various aspects that one should “know”. [91]
These ways of interrelation show the degree to which the order of the discourses in this
part of the Majjhima-nikāya suits the requirements of oral transmission, where discourses
that have some aspect or other in common follow each other, thereby facilitating the reciter’s task to recall the whole group in the proper sequence and without omissions.
In sum, then, the structure of the Majjhima-nikāya and the order in which its discourses
are arranged appears to reflect the influence of oral transmission. The same can also be
seen in several aspects of its discourses, which I now survey in more detail.

14   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


The standard opening to a discourse in the Majjhima-nikāya reads “thus I have heard, at
one time”, [92] followed by noting the whereabouts of the Buddha at the time of the particular event or teaching recorded in the discourse. The opening “I have heard” quite explicitly draws attention to the oral nature of what is to follow. [93] According to the traditional
account, these words were spoken by Ānanda and stand for his oral reception and subsequent transmission of the teachings he had heard. [94] Not only the content, but also the
form of this formulaic beginning testifies to oral transmission. Already these first few
words, found at the beginning of each discourse, exhibit metrical and sound similarities
that recur throughout the discourses (see table 0.2 below). Such sound similarities can involve ‘alliteration’, repetition of an initial sound, ‘assonance’, repetition of a sound
found in the middle of a word, and ‘homoioteleuton’, repetition of the final sound. [95]
The two parts of the Pāli version of this standard opening to a discourse, eva� me suta� and eka� samaya�, each consist of five syllables. The first word in each part, eva�
and eka�, is closely similar, differing only in respect to their second consonant. The
words eva�, suta�, eka� and samaya� share the same -a� ending, [96] while the words
suta� and samaya� share the same initial consonant. [97] Thus, even though these few
words are merely a prose introduction to a discourse, a closer inspection reveals sound
similarities that occur with considerable frequency in other prose sections of the early
discourses, especially in listings of similar words or in formulaic expressions. [98]


92 In regard to this standard opening of a discourse, Brough 1950: 416 adduces the Tibetan version of this
opening, ’di skad bdag gis thos pa dus gcig na bcom ldan ’das, in support of taking eka� samaya� to
qualify eva� mayā śruta�, i.e. “at one time I heard: the Blessed One was staying at ... ” (a similar proposal had earlier been made by von Staël-Holstein 1933: iv, cf. also Tatz 1997). Yet, as Tola 1999: 54
points out, to use the qualification “at one time” in regard to the Buddha’s whereabouts is more meaningful than using the same qualification to indicate that the oral transmission of the discourse took place “at
one time”. Moreover, the phrase tena samayena that regularly introduces the next sentence in the standard
beginning part of a discourse obviously refers to the time when the events recorded in the discourse took
place, in view of which it would be more natural for the preceding eka� samaya� to refer to the same. For
critical remarks regarding Brough’s arguments cf. also, e.g., Galloway 1991, Klaus 2007, and Silk 1989
(for further references related to this topic cf. Bongard-Levin 1996: 90 note 1, to which now could be
added Nattier (forthcoming) and Sander 2007: 174-176). According to von Hinüber 1968: 85-86, in as
much as Pāli sources are concerned, no arguments can be found for assuming that eka� samaya� qualifies
eva� me suta�. Samtani 1964: 49 notes that Jain sūtras have a similar opening: suyam me. On the standard Chinese rendering of this beginning phrase cf., e.g., Qingzhi 2010: 494.
93 Cabezón 2004: 755 remarks that this standard opening signals “the oral/aural nature of the original transmission”. Levering 1989: 61 notes another function of this introductory formula, in that “teachings were
authenticated by the fact that ... they had been heard by a specific hearer, that he had heard the Buddha
teach them at a particular time and place”.

95 Extracts of the present discussion already appeared in Anālayo 2007e.
96 The choice of the accusative eka� samaya� instead of the locative ekasmi� samaye (cf. Wijesekera 1993:
56) might be related to the sound similarity this creates with the preceding eva� me suta�.
97 Allon 1997a: 195.

Another oral feature of the early discourses can be found in the frequent use of strings
of synonyms. Such a string of synonyms serves to safeguard against loss, since a whole
set of similar words stands much greater chance of being remembered than a single word
and also better impresses itself on the audience. [99] A closer look at such strings or clusters
of words brings to light that its members tend to occur in a metrical sequence that follows the principle of “waxing syllables”. [100] Table 0.3 below gives a few examples of this
principle, showing how a particular theme is treated by a series of terms, where the words
with fewer syllables are followed by words with an equal or greater number of syllables. [101] The same principle can also be applied to listings and enumerations whose members do not share the same meaning.
The crescendo effect that results from the application of this principle is a typical stylistic feature of the early discourses, further enhanced when word sequences arranged
according to the waxing syllable principle also share sound similarities. If a sequence of
words becomes relatively long, this principle is not applied to the sequence as a whole,
but to subunits within the sequence. [102] Such subunits can share a similar nuance of mean

99 Oldenberg 1917: 42 explains that the use of such strings of synonyms gives the impression of a childlike
insistence that ensures that all aspects of a particular matter find expression (“so ensteht eine gewisse
kindliche Nachdrücklichkeit, man sichert sich, daß keine Seite der Sache unausgedrückt bleibt”).
100 A brief survey of this principle can be found in Anālayo 2009v.
101 Examples are from [[MN12]] at MN I 82,26, [[MN16]] at MN I 101,7, [[MN35]] at MN I 231,37, [[MN50]] at MN I
334,23, [[MN53]] at MN I 354,36, [[MN66]] at MN I 450,34 (C [e] -MN II 196,7 reads da�iddo, S [e] -MN II 184,10:
da�iddo and anā�iyo), and [[MN66]] at MN I 451,36 (S [e] -MN II 186,6: addho), taking a lead from von Hinüber 1994b: 16-30 and Smith 1948: 35. Von Hinüber 1994b: 33 (cf. also id. 1999b: 152) draws attention
to similar formulas in Jain texts, such as na��ā, gīa, vāiya, corresponding to nacca, gīta, vādita found,
e.g., in [[MN27]] at MN I 180,6; cf. also Allon 1997a: 266 and Caillat 1965: 198.
102 Allon 1997b: 48 mentions the description of irrelevant talk as an example, found, e.g., in [[MN76]] at MN I
513,23: rājakatha� corakatha� mahāmattakatha�, 4+4+6, senākatha� bhayakatha� yuddhakatha�,
annakatha� pānakatha� vatthakatha� sayanakatha�, 4+4+4+4+4+4+5, mālākatha� gandhakatha�,
ñātikatha� yānakatha�, gāmakatha� nigamakatha� nagarakatha� janapadakatha�, 4+4+4+4+4+5
+5+6, itthikatha� sūrakatha� visikhākatha� kumbha��hānakatha� pubbapetakatha�, 4+4+5+6+6 (S [e]  MN II 288,13+14+15 does not have vatthakatha�, reads itthīkatha� and adds kumbhadāsikatha�, C [e] -MN
II 308,10+11 has yānakatha� earlier (after vatthakatha�) and adds purisakatha�). The division suggested
by the principle of waxing syllables would result in several subunits in this passage (following E [e] ), each
of which then can be seen to cover one or more topics: “kings, robbers, ministers”, then “armies, dangers,
battles” together with the essential requisites of “food, drink, clothing, beds”, then various aspects of
household life such as “garlands, perfumes, relatives, vehicles” together with a listing of localities “vil

ing or belong to the same category. The division into subunits might have the function of
setting a rhythm that allows the reciter to take a breath during recitation.

The oral nature of the early discourses also manifests in the frequent occurrence of
repetition. [103] When treating a particular topic in its positive and negative manifestations,
for example, it is a standard procedure in the discourses that the same passage is repeated
with precisely the same words and formulations used for the positive case, making only
the most minimal changes required to adjust these to the negative case. The same procedure becomes even more prominent when a series of different perspectives on a particular topic are explored. Thus an examination of four types of person or modes of
acting, for example, can use four times nearly the same text in order to achieve its aim.
In addition to the frequent occurrence of repetition within a single discourse, the early
discourses also make recurrent use of “pericopes”, formulaic expressions or standard
phrases that depict a recurrent situation or event and whose purpose is to facilitate memorization. [104] Whether it is a description of how someone approaches the Buddha or of how


lages, towns, cities, counties”, and finally a set of topics for gossip that comprises “women, heroes, streets,
wells, the dead”.
103 Demiéville in Renou 1953/2001: 333 notes that the frequent use of stereotyped formulas is characteristic
of the early discourses, “les sutta ont un style caractérisé pas l’emploi constant de formules stéréotypées”,
cf. also Gethin 2007 for a case study of repetitions in the Sa�yutta-nikāya, and Weeratunge 2004 for a
survey of various forms of repetition in Pāli discourses and of their predecessors in ancient Indian literature. Reat 1996: 17 comments that such “extensive verbatim repetition” indicates “that the Sutta Pi�aka is
a sincere attempt to record memorized versions of individual sermons rather than an edited compilation of
doctrine”; cf. also Yit 2004a, id. 2004b, and id. 2008.
104 Griffiths 1983: 58 explains that the use of pericopes is “a direct result of the methods by which sacred
material was preserved and handed on in the early Buddhist communities; the demands of mnemonic
convenience ... meant that the units of tradition ... had to be ... reduced to an easily memorized standard
form”. Von Simson 1965: 56 compares the function of such pericopes in Buddhist prose to the bones and
tendons in the human body, in that both provide stability and support for the other parts. Smith 1987: 598,
in an examination of modern oral literature in India, reports the finding that a Rajasthani epic that made
frequent use of pericopes (which he describes to involve that “every battle ... is the same battle, every


Introduction   •   17


someone attains liberation, pericopes will be employed with a fixed set of phrases and
expressions, with only the most minimal changes introduced to adapt these pericopes to
the individual occasion. These two features, the repetition of passages within a discourse
and the use of pericopes throughout a discourse collection, are responsible for the highly
repetitive nature of the early discourses. [105]
These oral characteristics of the Pāli discourses testify to the importance of verbatim
repetition in the early Buddhist oral tradition. [106] In this respect, the early Buddhist oral
tradition differs from oral traditions in general, where improvisation can be a prominent
feature. The performance of oral literature of an epic or narrative type demands innovation and improvisation from the performer, whose task is to present the main elements of
a tale in such a way as to best entertain the audience. This type of oral literature is thus
freely re-created every time it is told. [107] In contrast, the purpose of the early Buddhist
oral tradition was the preservation of sacred material, for which free improvisation is
inappropriate. [108] Moreover, recitation was often undertaken communally by the reciters,
which leaves little scope for free improvisation. [109]
The emphasis on verbatim transmission in the early Buddhist oral tradition can even be
detected in some transmission errors, where in otherwise closely similar Pāli and Sanskrit passages the counterpart to a particular term shows close phonetic similarity but has
a considerably different meaning. [110] In such cases, the reciters’ attempt at precise recall
has apparently preserved formal aspects, even though the meaning was lost.

journey is the same journey, every meeting the same meeting”) was transmitted with considerably greater
accuracy than other comparable epics. Smith 1977: 151 explains that the reason for the employment of
pericopes and the resulting greater accuracy “may lie in the fact that the epic is not merely sung for entertainment, but has a religious function”, a reason that would hold true also for the use of pericopes in the
oral transmission of the early Buddhist discourses. The employment of such formulaic expressions need
not invariably be a later feature, but could have been used to some extent already at the time of the original delivery of a discourse, cf. in more detail below p. 855.
105 In his detailed study of these features in a selected Dīgha-nikāya discourse, Allon 1997a: 359 comes to
the conclusion that about 87% of the text of this discourse involves some form of repetition. He concludes
(p. 360) that “repetition thus thoroughly permeates every dimension of this class of Buddhist literature”.
106 Allon 1997a: 252 explains that “it is surely easier to remember a sequence of words arranged ... according
to syllable length”, just as “it is easier to remember two different words when they share sound similarities
and have the same metrical pattern”.
107 Lord 1987: 71 describes that such oral transmission involves “never merely memorizing a fixed entity,
but ... ever re-creating a new version of older forms and stories”.
108 Bechert 1985: 21 points out that oral tradition in India had achieved a high degree of precision, so that, as
pointed out by Graham 1987: 138, the “oral transmission of scripture should not be confused with folk
oral tradition in which verbatim accuracy is not aspired to”, cf. also Winternitz 1908: 34.
109 Allon 1997b: 42 highlights that “communal or group recitation or performance requires fixed wording”
and would not allow for improvisation. According to Coward 1988: 146, “group listening to check for errors is still an accepted method of verification in rural India today”.
110 Von Simson 1965: 137-138 gives the following examples: vivattacchaddo – vighu��aśabdo, brahmujjuggatto – b�had�jugātro, muducitta� – muditacitta�, aññataro – ājñātavān, sammodi sammodanīya� –
sammukha� sammodanī�.


18   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


As is only to be expected of material that has been orally transmitted over longer periods of time, in spite of measures undertaken to ensure correct transmission, variations
between different versions of a discourse occur fairly often.
Notably, such differences not only manifest between texts that have been transmitted
by different Buddhist schools. They can even be found within the material handed on by
a single school, such as within the corpus of texts transmitted in Pāli by the Theravāda
tradition.
A difference in the use of pericopes can be seen, for example, between a discourse in
the Dīgha-nikāya and a discourse in the A�guttara-nikāya, both of which report the same
event, namely a visit paid by the minister Vassakāra to the Buddha. [111] While the Dīghanikāya version describes in detail how Vassakāra got his chariot ready, drove with the
chariot and then descended from the chariot to proceed on foot, [112] its A�guttara-nikāya
counterpart does not mention Vassakāra’s mode of arrival at all, but simply notes that he
approached the Buddha. [113]
Another case where the records of the same event differ in the detail in which they depict how someone approaches the Buddha can be found by comparing the four discourses
that record the last meeting between Māra and the Buddha. [114] While the Dīgha-nikāya
and the Udāna versions report that Māra approached the Buddha, stood at one side and
then addressed the Buddha, [115] the Sa�yutta-nikāya version of the same event does not
mention that he stood at one side, but only indicates that he approached the Buddha, [116]
and the A�guttara-nikāya version does not describe his approach at all. [117]

than the “chariot approach” pericope employed in the Dīgha-nikāya.

Pericopes also differ when it comes to describing the respectful attitude with which
someone listens to a sermon given by the Buddha or a monk after a meal. For such occasions, the Dīgha-nikāya, the Majjhima-nikāya, the Udāna, and the Sutta-nipāta employ a
pericope that describes how the listener(s) take(s) a low seat, an obvious expression of
respect. [118] Similar situations in the Vinaya and in the A�guttara-nikāya, however, do not
mention a low seat. [119] This difference is particularly notable in the case of a meal given
by Prince Bodhi, as the same meal is recorded in the Majjhima-nikāya and in the Vinaya,
so that in this case the same event is described once with and once without the taking of
the low seat. [120] Such differences suggest that during the process of oral transmission the
specialisation of reciter groups in particular discourse collections led to variations even
within the fold of a single school.
The relatively circumstantial differences noted so far may seem negligible, since they
do not affect essential matters. Not all such errors, however, are of such circumstantial
character. A somewhat more significant variation occurs in relation to the use of pericopes usually employed at the conclusion of a discourse, found between the Sa�yuttanikāya and the Sutta-nipāta versions of the Kasibhāradvāja-sutta. These two discourses
record the same event but differ in their conclusion, as according to the Sa�yutta-nikāya
account Kasibhāradvāja took refuge and declared himself a lay follower, while according
to the Sutta-nipāta version he requested ordination and became an arahant. [121]

118 The pericope of “taking of a low seat”, aññatara� nīca� āsana� gahetvā, leads from the pericope that
describes the giving of a meal, pa�ītena khādanīyena bhojanīyena sahatthā santappesi sampavāresi, to a

(= [[MN92]] at MN II 146). The same pericope can also be found regularly in the Madhyama-āgama, cf.,

ches), whereas in the Pāli version, [[MN82]] at MN II 64,23, the whole episode is not found. Sanskrit occurrences are, e.g., nīcataram āsana� g�hītvā in Dutt 1984a: 265,15, being a counterpart to [[SNP3.7]] at Sn p.

Once variations in the use of pericopes are found between different Pāli collections, it
is not surprising that such variations also occur between the Majjhima-nikāya and its
counterpart in the Madhyama-āgama collection.
In regard to the use of pericopes, discourses found in the Madhyama-āgama regularly
describe that a monk would fan the Buddha, [122] a circumstance noted only rarely in Majjhima-nikāya discourses. [123] On frequent occasions, Madhyama-āgama discourses also
mention the sitting mat, [124] one of the standard requisites of a monk, while their Pāli counterparts tend to refer to the same accessory only on very few occasions. [125]

assumes that differences in the degree to which the sitting mat is mentioned explicitly in Majjhima-nikāya
or Madhyama-āgama discourses respectively reflect actual differences in its use in the southern and
northern Buddhist traditions. Yet, the sitting mat is even nowadays in use among forest monks of the Theravāda tradition, in fact the different Vinayas consider the sitting mat as one of the basic requisites of a
monk, cf. the regulations on its proper size in the pācittiya or pātayantika rule 87 in the Dharmaguptaka
Vinaya, T 1428 at T XXII 694b25 (translated in Wieger 1951: 249), rule 87 in the Kāśyapīya Vinaya, T
1460 at T XXIV 663c12, rule 87 in the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya, T 1421 at T XXII 71a10, rule 86 in the Mahāsā�ghika Vinaya, T 1425 at T XXII 392c2, rule 87 in the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, T 1442 at T XXIII
895c23, rule 89 in the Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, T 1435 at T XXIII 130a28 (translated Rosen 1959: 214), and
rule 89 in the Theravāda Vinaya at Vin IV 170,29; cf. also a description of the use of the sitting mat in
seventh century India, provided by Yìjìng ( ), T 2125 at T LIV 221a8, translated in Takakusu 1966:
110-111. Given this general agreement, the absence of references to the sitting mat in Pāli discourses may
simply be due to the use of different pericopes and need not be taken as reflecting actual differences in its
use.

Introduction   •   21


Another standard pericope found in the Madhyama-āgama describes how a visitor or a
monk will depart from the presence of the Buddha by performing three circumambulations, while Majjhima-nikāya discourses mention only a single circumambulation. [126]
The two collections also differ in their descriptions of how listeners will express their
appreciation of the teachings. Whereas in a Majjhima-nikāya discourse such a person
will exclaim “excellent, excellent”, in a Madhyama-āgama discourse he (or she) will rather
inform the Buddha: “I understood, I realized”. [127]
Again, discourses in the Madhyama-āgama collection regularly describe that when
someone asks the Buddha or a monk a question, the actual question will be preceded by a
request for permission to put a question, [128] a pericope found only rarely in the Majjhimanikāya. [129]
Other pericopes are found only in the Majjhima-nikāya and are absent from the Madhyama-āgama. One example is the pericope employed regularly at the beginning of a
Majjhima-nikāya discourse, in which the Buddha addresses his disciples with “monks”,
and the monks reply “venerable sir”, after which the Buddha announces his topic and
proceeds to deliver the discourse. [130]
A closer inspection shows that this pericope stands in contrast to the remainder of the
discourses in which it occurs, in as much as the vocative “monks”, bhikkhavo, used in


126 Cf., e.g., [[MA132]] at T I 623b23:, and its parallel [[MN82]] at MN II 56,22: padakkhi�a� katvā; cf.
also [[MA133]] at T I 630c17 and [[MN56]] at MN I 380,16. The same pericope recurs in several Madhyamaāgama discourses in places where the corresponding Majjhima-nikāya version does not record any circumambulation at all, cf., e.g., [[MA28]] at T I 458c23, [[MA63]] at T I 500a12, [[MA79]] at T I 549b27, [[MA105]]
at T I 596a28, [[MA146]] at T I 656a22, [[MA151]] at T I 666b28, [[MA161]] at T I 686a18, [[MA165]] at T I 696c18,
[[MA167]] at T I 700a8, [[MA193]] at T I 744a20, [[MA195]] at T I 750b1, [[MA201]] at T I 767a4, [[MA212]] at T I
792c29, [[MA213]] at T I 796c4, and [[MA216]] at T I 801c7. A reference to three circumambulations can be
found in [[DN16]] at DN II 163,27, according to which Mahākassapa performed three circumambulations of
the Buddha’s funeral pyre, tikkhattu� citaka� padakkhi�a� katvā. Part of this pericope has also been
preserved in a Sanskrit fragment parallel to [[MA161]] at T I 686a18, cf. SHT V 1148R4: triprada(k�i�īk�tvā). Three circumambulations are also mentioned in Jain texts, cf. Hoernle 1885/1989: 9 note 17. 繞三匝
127 E.g., [[MN7]] at MN I 39,27: abhikkanta� ... abhikkanta�, and [[MA93]] at T I 576a10: ...
128 Cf., e.g., [[MA29]] at T I 461b28, [[MA34]] at T I 475a17, [[MA79]] at T I 549c26, [[MA144]] at T I 652a12, [[MA145]] at T I 654a5, [[MA150]] at T I 661a4, [[MA151]] at T I 664a12, [[MA152]] at T I 667a17, [[MA170]] at T I
704c18, [[MA171]] at T I 706b18, [[MA173]] at T I 710a10, [[MA198]] at T I 757a9, [[MA210]] at T I 788a19, [[MA211]] at T I 790b14, [[MA212]] at T I 793b15, [[MA214]] at T I 798a9, and [[MA217]] at T I 802a28 (listing only
Madhyama-āgama discourses that have a parallel in the Majjhima-nikāya).
129 Cf., e.g., [[MN35]] at MN I 229,35, [[MN109]] at MN III 15,23, and [[MN144]] at MN III 264,30. Notably, although none of these three Pāli discourses has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama, each has a parallel in
the Sa�yukta-āgama, where in each case this pericope is not found, cf. [[SA58]] at T II 14b17 (parallel to
[[MN109]]), [[SA110]] at T II 35c11 (parallel to [[MN35]]), and [[SA1266]] at T II 347c23 (parallel to [[MN144]]). A
Tibetan version of this pericope can be found in the parallel to [[MN90]] D (1) ’dul ba, 我已知 kha 88a1 我已解. or Q (1030)
ge 81a6, in which case it also occurs in the Madhyama-āgama parallel to the same discourse, [[MA212]] at
T I 793b15, but not in the Pāli version.
130 E.g., in [[MN1]] at MN I 1,3: bhikkhavo ti. bhadante ti te bhikkhū bhagavato paccassosu�; on the use of
this pericope cf. also Manné 1990: 33 and Meisig 1987a: 225.


22   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


this passage, differs from the vocative address “monks”, bhikkhave, used in all remaining
instances in the respective discourse. [131] Similarly, the first vocative “venerable sir”, bhadante, used by the monks, is not the same as the vocative “venerable sir”, bhante, found
in the remainder of the discourse. [132] While such different usages may be intended to convey a sense of emphasis, it could also be that this whole pericope was added at some point
during the transmission of the discourses. In fact, such a pericope is not found in the
Madhyama-āgama, although it does occur in an individual translation that stems from a
(no longer extant) Madhyama-āgama collection. [133]
To sum up, the standard opening of a discourse as “thus I have heard”, the occurrence
of metrical and sound similarities, the application of the principle of waxing syllables
and the recurrent use of repetition and pericopes testify to the emphasis on verbatim
recall in the early Buddhist oral tradition. At the same time, the use of pericopes varies
not only among discourses that belong to different reciter lineages, but also among reciters that belong to the same school. These two aspects, the attempt at precise recall and
the variations in oral transmission, stand at the background of my comparative study of
the Majjhima-nikāya discourses in the following pages.


131 [[MN1]] at MN I 1,5 continues with bhikkhave. On the vocative bhikkhave cf. Bechert 1980: 29, id. 1988:
131, or id. 1991: 11, and Lüders 1954: 13. Pind 2004: 512 explains that in such introductory sentences
“bhikkhavo is used as a marked emphatic voc. as opposed to bhikkhave, which is used as an enclitic unmarked vocative”; cf. also von Hinüber 1985/2001: 238, who notes that Sadd 190,6 offers an explanation
for the use of bhikkhave alongside bhikkhavo in certain contexts.
132 [[MN1]] at MN I 1,7 continues with bhante.
133 T 48 at T I 837c25: “the Buddha said: ‘monks!’, the monks replied: ‘yes, indeed!’, the monks listened to
the Buddha, the Buddha said ... ”,,, . According to the
introductory remark in T 48 at T I 837c21, this discourse belongs to a Madhyama-āgama collection,

## Chapter 1 Mūlapariyāya-vagga

### [[MN1]] Mūlapariyāya-sutta

The Mūlapariyāya-sutta, the “discourse on the root instruction”, [1] analyses the perceptual processes of different types of person. [2] This discourse has a Chinese parallel in the
Ekottarika-āgama. [3] Besides this parallel, a discourse from the Madhyama-āgama and an
individual Chinese translation found outside of the four Āgamas offer a similar presentation, although they differ to such an extent from the Majjhima-nikāya and Ekottarikaāgama versions as to make it probable that these two discourses go back to a different
original. [4]
The theme of the Mūlapariyāya-sutta and its Ekottarika-āgama parallel is the perceptual reaction to a variety of phenomena by four types of person:

 - a worldling,

 - a disciple in higher training (sekha),

 - an arahant,

 - a Tathāgata.
The other two Chinese discourses differ, as their presentation is based on taking up three
types of person:

 - recluses and Brahmins that fall prey to conceivings in regard to phenomena,


1 Premasiri 2003b: 52 explains the title Mūlapariyāya to imply that this discourse explores the “root of existence ... by a thorough analysis of the workings of the perceptual and cognitive processes of human beings
with a view to unravelling the psychological sources of human bondage”.
2 A somewhat similar exposition on penetrative knowledge in regard to the elements and various heavenly
beings occurs in [[MN49]] at MN I 329,12 and its parallel [[MA78]] at T I 548a3. A description of stages of conceiving by way of the accusative, locative and ablative cases, although in this case in relation to the six senses,
can also be found in [[SN35.30]] at SN IV 22,5.
3 The parallel is [[EA44.6]] at T II 766a-b. [[EA44.6]] at T II 766a7 gives the discourse’s title as “the root of all
dharmas”,, while the summary verse (uddāna) at T II 769b6 just reads . [[EA44.6]]
agrees with [[MN1]] in locating the discourse at Ukka��hā ( ), a town in the district of Kosala, situated
in the foothills of the Himālaya (cf. Malalasekera 1937/1995: 329). According to an account of the first
council in the, T 2026 at T XLIX 3a16, however, the present discourse was spoken
among the Sakyans. For a translation of [[EA44.6]] cf. Pāsādika 2008a: 142-145.
4 These two discourses are [[MA106]] at T I 596b-c and T 56 at T I 851a-b. Unlike [[MN1]] and [[EA44.6]] [[MA106]] and T 56 have Jeta’s Grove by Sāvatthī as their location. [[MA106]] has the title “discourse on perception”,, while T 56 has the title “discourse spoken by the Buddha on delighting in perception”,
. According to the information given in the Taishō edition, T 56 was translated by Dharmarak�a.
[[MA106]] has been examined and translated by Minh Chau 1964/1991: 34-35, 204, and 211-214. On the
problem of categorizing these two discourses as ‘parallels’ to [[MN1]] cf. also Anālayo 2008d: 11. Regarding 一切諸法之本 法之本
the qualification of T 56 as a discourse “spoken by the Buddha 優迦羅 ”,, this character couplet appears regularly in the titles of works in the Chinese canon, where in most cases it probably does not render an expression present in the original, but serves as a formula of authentication of the translated scripture. 撰集三藏及雜藏傳

     - recluses and Brahmins that do not fall prey to such conceivings,

     - the Buddha.
In regard to the worldling, [5] the Mūlapariyāya-sutta explains how perceiving earth
leads to conceiving “earth” in various ways, such as “earth”, “in earth”, and “from earth”,
followed by treating earth as “mine” and by delighting in earth. In this way, the Pāli discourse depicts a series of conceivings (maññanā), [6] which establish a relationship between
the perceiving subject and the perceived object by way of the accusative, locative, and
ablative cases, a series of conceivings that culminates in the arising of delight.
The Ekottarika-āgama discourse agrees with the Mūlapariyāya-sutta that the worldling
perceives earth as earth, which it follows up by indicating that the worldling then takes
earth to be really earth. [7]
The Madhyama-āgama discourse describes taking earth to be the self, or earth being
part of the self, or the self being part of earth. [8] The individual translation speaks of delighting in earth and identifying with it. [9]
The four discourses agree that such conceivings take place due to the absence of true
understanding. From the first example of conceiving earth, the four discourses apply
their respective treatments to various other phenomena, thereby demonstrating the comprehensive scope of such conceivings. The Pāli and Chinese versions differ on the phenomena covered in their respective expositions (see table 1.1). They agree, however, in
mentioning:

       - the four elements,

       - various heavenly beings,

       - the four immaterial spheres,

       - what is seen, heard, sensed, and cognised,

       - unity,

       - diversity,

       - all.

MN I 4  Of particular interest is that the Majjhima-nikāya version and its Ekottarika-āgama parallel include Nirvā�a in their respective lists. [10] The Mūlapariyāya-sutta’s presentation of


5 On the notion of a puthujjana cf., e.g., Kariyawasam 2005.
6 Ñā�avīra 1987/2001: 97 explains that “this tetrad of maññānā, of ‘conceivings’, represents four progressive
levels of explicitness in the basic structure of appropriation. The first, ‘he conceives X’, is so subtle that the
appropriation is simply implicit in the verb”.
7 [[EA44.6]] at T II 766a13: “this is earth, certainly like this is earth, truly like this is earth”,
. This passage on its own could also be taken to instruct how to properly contemplate earth, but
the remark made a little later that this happens because such a person “is one without knowledge”, [[EA44.6]]
at T II 766a26:, shows that a form of misconceiving is intended, as is the case in the corresponding
passage in [[MN1]]

8 [[MA106]] at T I 596b13: “in regard to earth he has the perception: ‘earth’, ‘earth now is the self’, ‘earth belongs to the self’, ‘the self belongs to earth’”, .
9 T 56 at T I 851a28: “in regard to earth he has the perception: ‘earth’, he delights in earth, he speculates that
earth is for me, and he declares: ‘earth is the self!’”, .

Nirvā�a as a phenomenon prone to lead to conceivings and to appropriation in terms of
‘mine’ should, according to the Pāli commentary, be understood to refer to wrong notions of Nirvā�a, held by those who mistake sensual enjoyment or attainment of a jhāna
to be the final goal. [11]

The commentarial explanation is not entirely convincing, since the Mūlapariyāya-sutta
instructs the disciple in higher training (sekha), someone who already has experienced at
least stream-entry and is ‘training’ for the attainment of full awakening, to avoid conceivings and delight in regard to Nirvā�a. [13] This instruction would make little sense if the
Nirvā�a the present discourse refers to were indeed a wrong notion of Nirvā�a. There
would be no need to advise a disciple in higher training, someone who has already experienced Nirvā�a, to avoid conceivings and delighting in regard to a mistaken notion of


10 [[MN1]] at MN I 4,3 and [[EA44.6]] at T II 766a25. Nirvā�a is not taken up in [[MA106]] or in T 56.
11 Ps I 38,27, translated in Jayawickrama 2004: 18. These correspond to the five claims to “ultimate Nirvā�a
here and now”, parama di��hadhamma nibbāna, listed in the Brahmajāla-sutta, [[DN1]] at DN I 36,17, and
found similarly in its Chinese parallel [[DA21]] at T I 93b15 and in its Tibetan parallel in Weller 1934: 56,36.
12 Here and elsewhere, the use of → in the tables shows which sections in the parallel version(s) correspond
to the Majjhima-nikāya presentation. In case sections from the Majjhima-nikāya discourse have no counterpart, I list these at the bottom of the table, marking them with ≠.
13 [[MN1]] at MN I 4,30.


26   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


Nirvā�a, since such conceivings and delight would not occur in the first place. [14] This
suggests that the instructions in the Mūlapariyāya-sutta and its Ekottarika-āgama parallel have the Buddhist conception of Nirvā�a in mind. [15]
The rationale behind the need to refrain from delighting, the Mūlapariyāya-sutta explains, is that delight is a root cause for the arising of dukkha. [16] In general, the expression
“to delight”, abhinandati, need not carry negative connotations. It recurs, for example, as
part of the standard conclusion to a discourse, according to which the monks “delight” in
what the Buddha has said.
In the present instance in the Mūlapariyāya-sutta, however, delight comes as the climax of a set of conceivings and imaginings, a climax immediately preceded by taking
Nirvā�a as “mine”. This indicates that the type of delight envisaged in this particular
context is related to craving and grasping, which explains why a disciple in higher training should better avoid such delight.
The corresponding passage in the Ekottarika-āgama version speaks of not “having
attachment” to Nirvā�a, instead of not “delighting” in it, which indicates that, from its
perspective, the attitude towards Nirvā�a in the present context clearly has unwholesome
connotations. Thus, the point made in both versions of the present discourse appears to
be highlighting the need to avoid developing any form of conceivings and attachment
even in relation to the final goal.

MN I 5  In regard to the stage of the arahant, the Majjhima-nikāya and Ekottarika-āgama versions agree in clarifying that the perceptual mastery of arahants is due to their eradication
of lust, anger, and delusion. [17] When taking up the Buddha’s perceptual mastery, the Mūlapariyāya-sutta and the Ekottarika-āgama version highlight his successful eradication of
craving and his transcendence of the dependent arising of birth, old age, and death.

MN I 6  Several editions of the Mūlapariyāya-sutta conclude by reporting that the monks were
not delighted with this discourse. [18] This rather unusual ending was also known to the Pāli


14 Ñā�ananda 2005: 282.
15 Gethin 1997b: 222 (in the context of an examination of right and wrong view) points out that the “Buddhist
tradition recognises that what is formally Buddhist theory can be grasped and held in a manner such that it
constitutes wrong view”. From this perspective, even a concept like Nirvā�a would have the potential of
leading to misguided conceivings and appropriations. This appears to have been an understanding of the
present passage held among the Pubbaseliyas, who according to Kv 404,15 referred to the Mūlapariyāyasutta in support of their opinion that the deathless (amata) as an object of the mind can become a fetter
(sa�yojana).
16 [[MN1]] at MN I 6,11: nandī dukkhassa mūla� (Ce-M I 18,4 and Se-M I 11,1: nandi).
17 [[MN1]] at MN I 5,4+16+28 and [[EA44.6]] at T II 766b10. Chaudhary 1994c: 71 notes that stanzas in the Bhagavad-gīta (cf. especially 2:56-58) offer a description of an accomplished saint that has several elements
in common with the present passage.
18 Be-MN I 8,19, Ce-MN I 18,9, and Se-MN I 11,6 record that the monks did not delight in what the Buddha
had said. Only E [e] at MN I 6,24 reports that the monks delighted in the discourse. According to [[EA44.6]] at
T II 766b15, “the monks did not accept that teaching”, . An extract from the present discussion already appeared in Anālayo 2008a: 9-10.

Chapter 1 Mūlapariyāya-vagga                                     -  27


commentators. They explain that the Buddha preached this discourse to humble a group
of five hundred monks, who had developed conceit on account of their intellectual mastery of the Buddha’s teaching. [19] Their lack of delight, the commentary explains, was because they had been unable to understand what the Buddha had taught them. [20]
The Ekottarika-āgama version agrees with the Pāli commentary in as much as it reports that the monks had been unable to grasp the teaching the Buddha had delivered to
them. It attributes their inability in this respect to the fact that their minds had been obstructed by Māra. [21]
Looking back on the Mūlapariyāya-sutta and its Ekottarika-āgama parallel, the close
similarity between these two discourses stands in marked contrast to the Madhyama-āgama discourse and the individual translation. [22] These two discourses vary from the Majjhima-nikāya and Ekottarika-āgama versions not only in regard to title and location, but
also in regard to the basic pattern adopted in their treatments: instead of taking up the
worldling, the disciple in higher training, the arahant and the Buddha, they discuss deluded recluses and Brahmins, their wiser counterparts, and the Buddha. These two versions, moreover, do not include Nirvā�a in their treatment, nor do they mention the unusual reaction of the listening monks.
These differences and the contrast provided by the similarity between the Mūlapariyāya-sutta and its Ekottarika-āgama parallel give the impression, mentioned at the outset
of the present study, in that the Madhyama-āgama discourse and the individual translation may go back to a different original.


19 Ps I 56,8; cf. also the introduction to the Mūlapariyāya-jātaka, Jā 245 at Jā II 259,14. A similar episode recurs in the Kāśyapaparivarta, which reports how a group of five hundred monks, being unable to appreciate a teaching given by the Buddha, get up and leave, cf. the Sanskrit text in Vorobyova-Desyatovskaya
2002: 48, folio 69v2-3 (§ 138), Chinese versions found in T 310.43 at T XI 637b13, T 350 at T XII 193b15,
T 351 at T XII 199b26, T 352 at T XII 214c21, T 659 at T XVI 282a7, a Khotanese version in Skjærvø
2003: 417 (§ 142), and a Tibetan version at D (87) dkon brtsegs, cha 146b6 or Q (760.43) ’i 132a3, with a
synoptic edition in von Staël-Holstein 1926: 200-201, and translations in Chang 1983/1991: 406-407,
Pāsādika 1980: 52, Weller 1966: 339, id. 1966/1967: 422, and id. 1970: 149.
20 According to an alternative interpretation suggested by Bodhi 1980/1992: 20, Ñā�ananda 2005: 286, and
Thanissaro 2002: 156, perhaps the very fact that the monks understood this discourse caused them to be
unable to delight in it.
21 [[EA44.6]] at T II 766b15. [[EA44.6]] continues after this explanation with the Buddha instructing the monks to
meditate and not be negligent, followed by the monks delighting in what the Buddha had said. According
to the commentarial explanation at Ps I 59,5, the group of monks who had been the audience of [[MN1]] received a short discourse by the Buddha on a later occasion, the Gotamaka-sutta, a discourse whose conclusion reports that this time the monks did delight in what the Buddha had taught to them, cf. [[AN3.123]] at
AN I 276,23. Ps I 59,18 explains that they all became arahants during the delivery of this discourse.
22 The suggestion by Minh Chau 1964/1991: 204, based on comparing [[MN1]] only with [[MA106]] that the Pāli
reciters could have added the negation na to the conclusion “to earmark its expunging from the Pāli Tipi�aka, but the later Pāli compilers forgot to do so”, needs to be revised in the light of [[EA44.6]] Thus already
the present study of the first discourse in the Majjhima-nikāya shows the importance of taking into account
all known parallels for a proper assessment of the Pāli version.

### [[MN2]] Sabbāsava-sutta
The Sabbāsava-sutta, the “discourse on all the influxes”, presents seven methods for
abandoning the influxes (āsava). [23] This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama,
another parallel in the Ekottarika-āgama, and a third parallel in an individual translation. [24] In addition to these parallels preserved in Chinese translation, a version of the present discourse can also be found as a discourse quotation in Śamathadeva’s commentary
on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya, extant in Tibetan. [25] Another discourse relevant to a com

23 Concerning the significance of the term āsava or āsrava (which in the parallel versions has its Chinese and
Tibetan equivalents in,, and zag pa), according to Alsdorf 1965: 4 the use of this term by the Buddhists need not be a case of a borrowing from the Jains, but could rather be due to both traditions drawing
on already existing ancient Indian notions. For a detailed discussion of the term cf. also Schmithausen
1992: 123-127. Hirakawa 1993/1998: 198 explains that “in Jainism the term is used with the sense of inflow because defilements are said to flow from the external world into the body, where they adhere to the
ātman”, while “in Buddhist texts this term is used in the sense of outflow because the mind’s defilements
move outward and affect other things”, presumably in the sense of verbal or physical behaviour that expresses itself outwardly. Norman 1997: 34, however, comments that while “the etymology of this word
(the preposition ā ‘towards’ + the root sru- ‘to flow’) implies something flowing in, and this suits the Jain
usage well, since there the āsavas are influences which flow into a person and discolour his soul”, in contrast, the same imagery 漏 “does not suit the Buddhist idea, where the 流 āsavas are not attributes which are capable of flowing into a person”. The nuance of “outflow” is evident in [[AN3.26]] at AN I 124,8, where āsava stands for the discharge from a festering sore. [[AN6.63]] at AN III 414,16, however, distinguishes between
āsavas that lead to rebirth in five different realms (cf. also [[MA111]] at T I 599c1 and T 57 at T I 852a6),
where the sense of “outflow” would not fit the context too well. Similarly, in the present context the sense
of the term āsava does not seem to be just about “outflow”, but at times describes how to avoid detrimental
“influences”, e.g., by restraining the sense-doors, by enduring or avoiding difficulties. In fact, according to
Schmithausen 1992: 125, “ās(r)ava may, in Buddhist texts ... also denote annoyances, trouble, suffering”,
adding (p. 126) that “in the case of ās(r)ava the most archaic meaning is ‘dangers’ or ‘disturbances’ rushing in or intruding upon the ascetic”; cf. also Wayman 1991 and below p. 382-383 notes 217 and 218.
24 The parallels are [[MA10]] at T I 431c-432c, entitled “discourse on the extinction of influxes”, ; [[EA40.6]] at T II 740a-741b, entitled “a teaching on purification from the influxes”, (cf. T II 740a27);
and T 31 at T I 813a-814b, entitled “discourse spoken by the Buddha on restraining the causes of all influxes”,, a discourse that according to the information given in the Taishō edition
was translated by the Parthian Ān Shìgāo ( ), an attribution that according to Zacchetti 2010a: 253
is probably correct. Char 1991: 45 notes that translations by Ān Shìgāo tend to be quite literal, in contrast
to the more polished and free renderings of later translators; on Ān Shìgāo cf. also, e.g., Forte 1995 and
Harrison 2004. The Sa�gītiparyāya, T 1536 at T XXVI 394c3, refers to the present discourse as the “discourse [giving] an analysis of [how to] restrain the influxes”, ; cf. also the similar reference
to the “discourse on [how to] restrain the influxes” in the *Mahāvibhā�ā, T 1545 at T XXVII

translated in Lamotte 1970a: 1590, refers to a discourse in which seven ways of restraining the influxes are 佛說一切流攝守因經

parative study of the Sabbāsava-sutta is the Āsava-sutta in the A�guttara-nikāya, a Pāli
discourse that takes up the same topic, although its exposition appears to stem from a different occasion. [26]
The Sabbāsava-sutta, its Madhyama-āgama parallel, the individual translation and
the Tibetan version begin by pointing out that the destruction of the influxes can be
reached only by way of knowing and seeing, for which purpose wise attention (yoniso
manasikāra) is of crucial importance. [27]
The Sabbāsava-sutta and its Chinese and Tibetan parallels describe an untaught worldling who does not understand that giving attention to unsuitable things and not giving attention to suitable things causes the arising and increase of the influxes.
For the purpose of abandoning the influxes, [28] the Sabbāsava-sutta and its Chinese and
Tibetan parallels then list seven methods, with some variations in the sequence of their
presentation (see table 1.2). [29] According to the Sabbāsava-sutta, these seven methods
comprise:

 - seeing (dassana),

 - restraining (sa�vara),

 - using (pa�isevana),

 - enduring (adhivāsana),

 - avoiding (parivajjana),

 - removing (vinodana),

 - developing (bhāvanā).
The other Pāli discourse from the A�guttara-nikāya, the Āsava-sutta, begins instead by
announcing that a monk endowed with six qualities is worthy of offerings and respect. [30]
These six qualities are the successful implementation of six out of the seven methods
mentioned in the Sabbāsava-sutta and its Chinese and Tibetan parallels for the purpose

course as zag pa gang dag gi skye ba, “the arising of all influxes”; cf. also the discourse quotation at Abhidh-k 2:49 in Pradhan 1967: 82,25, paralleling [[MN2]] at MN I 7,7, with its Chinese counterparts in T 1558 at

seems to be meant only as a temporary overcoming, since otherwise it would be difficult to understand
how practices such as proper use of requisites and avoiding dangerous animals could in themselves suffice
for a permanent “abandoning” of the three influxes of sensual desire, existence, and ignorance (to which in
later times the influx of views was added as fourth; cf. below p. 382 note 217). For a discourse quotation
of the reference to the seven methods in the context of a discussion on how these square with the notion of
three influxes cf. also the *Mahāvibhā�ā, T 1545 at T XXVII 246b14.
29 Notably, the two methods concerned with developing positive qualities (proper vision and developing the
factors of awakening) form the beginning and culmination point in all parallel versions, thus differences of
sequence affect only the order of the remaining five methods, which are concerned with various aspects of 斷
restraint.

of abandoning the influxes. The method not found in the Āsava-sutta is “seeing”, which
is the first method in the other versions (see table 1.2).

MN I 8 The Sabbāsava-sutta and its Chinese and Tibetan parallels explain the method of “seeing” with the example of speculations about oneself in relation to past, present and future
times. [31] Such speculations, according to the Sabbāsava-sutta and its Chinese parallels,
can lead to six types of view about the existence and nature of the self. A noble disciple,
in contrast, avoids such speculations and by developing proper vision is able to eradicate
the three fetters and thereby to attain stream-entry. [32]

the parallel versions, is to “restrain” the six senses in order to avoid the arising of unwholesome mental states. [33]

described in [[SN12.20]] at SN II 26,27, in its parallel [[SA296]] at T II 84b27, and in Sanskrit fragment [[SN474]]
folio 10V7-10 in Tripā�hī 1962: 40, which agree in indicating that noble disciples are beyond such speculations due to their insight into dependent arising, while in [[MN2]] it is the noble disciple’s insight into the
four noble truths that leads beyond such speculations. This difference in presentation does not imply a major difference in meaning, since a noble disciple’s insight into the second and third noble truths would be
equivalent to his or her insight into dependent arising. A listing of such unwise speculations can also be
found in the Śrāvakabhūmi, Shukla 1973: 102,22 or ŚSG 1998: 156,18, with the Chinese counterpart in T
1579 at T XXX 412b19.

Chapter 1 Mūlapariyāya-vagga                                     -  31


The Sabbāsava-sutta continues by taking up the theme of “using”, a method concerned MN I 10
with the proper use of the four requisites of a monk or a nun. According to all versions,
proper use of robes means to employ them just to cover the body and to protect it from
the impact of weather and insects. The Madhyama-āgama and Ekottarika-āgama versions add that robes should not be used for the purpose of adornment, a point both versions also make in relation to dwelling places. [34] The Sabbāsava-sutta and the Āsava-sutta, however, speak of avoiding adornment in relation to the proper use of food. [35] This unexpected association of adornment to food invites further examination.
In other Pāli discourses, “adornment” refers to external embellishment, such as wearing garlands, bracelets, decorated sandals, jewels, and long-fringed clothes, etc. [36] Similarly, the injunction to refrain from “adornment” as part of the eight precepts undertaken
on full moon days by Buddhist lay followers is concerned with external forms of beautification. [37] In view of this, it would be more natural for the problem of “adornment” to
arise in relation to robes. A discourse in the Sa�yutta-nikāya and its parallel in the Sa�yukta-āgama provide an example of misuse of robes for the sake of adornment, as they
describe the monk Nanda incurring the Buddha’s reproach for wearing ironed robes. [38]
According to an explanation given in the Visuddhimagga, adornment in relation to
food takes place when one partakes of food in order to become plump or to have a clear
skin, such as harem women or actors might do. [39] This explanation appears somewhat
contrived. In sum, it seems that the Madhyama-āgama and Ekottarika-āgama parallels to
the Sabbāsava-sutta offer a more natural presentation by relating the problem of adornment to robes instead. [40]

in relation to all four requisites, D (4094) mngon pa, ju 93a4 or Q (5595) tu 106a4. Adornment in relation

MN II 139,26, which notes that the Buddha was not concerned with pādama��anānuyoga, rendered by
Horner 1957/1970: 325 as “the practice of beautifying his feet” and by Ñā�amoli 1995/2005: 748 as “grooming his feet”. An extract from the present discussion already appeared in Anālayo 2005b: 1-2. 不端正故

32   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


While differing on the implications of adornment, the Chinese and Tibetan versions
agree with the two Pāli versions that the proper use of alms food is for the sake of maintaining the body alive and healthy. In relation to the remaining two requisites, dwelling
place and medicine, all versions agree that their proper purpose is for the protection and
health of the body.
Next in the Sabbāsava-sutta’s list of methods for overcoming the influxes comes “enduring”, which according to all versions is to calmly bear vicissitudes of climate, hunger,
thirst, insect bites, insults, and bodily pains. [41] The Madhyama-āgama discourse, the individual translation, and the Tibetan version introduce this method by recommending the
firm determination not to give up striving even if one’s blood should dry up and one’s
body should fall apart, [42] a mental attitude that would indeed enable patiently enduring
any difficulty.
The fifth method in the Sabbāsava-sutta takes up the practice of “avoiding”, which according to all versions refers to avoiding dangerous animals and places, bad friends, and
unsuitable resorts. [43]

MN I 11  The sixth method in the Sabbāsava-sutta is “removing”, which in all versions refers to
removing thoughts of sensual desire, ill will, and cruelty. The method listed last in all
versions is to develop the seven factors of awakening (bojjha�ga), which according to
the Pāli account are to be combined with seclusion, fading away, and cessation, in order
to give rise to relinquishment, a point made similarly in the Madhyama-āgama, Ekottarika-āgama, and Tibetan versions. [44]
The Sabbāsava-sutta and its parallels conclude by stating that one who puts into practice these seven methods will be able to overcome the influxes and make an end of duk

I 814a7. The same vicissitudes of climate, etc., recur in a definition of the practice of “patience” in [[AN4.165]] at AN II 153,22 and in the Śrāvakabhūmi, Shukla 1973: 130,11 or ŚSG 1998: 216,8 and T 1579 at T
XXX 417c6. Johansson 1983: 23 comments that the way to abandon the influxes in relation to these vicissitudes requires that “no emotional or defensive reaction be resorted to”. Tatia 1980: 329 (cf. also id. 1993:
5) notes that such enduring was highly valued among the Jains, whose texts give similar listings of various
vicissitudes that should be endured with patience; cf., e.g., the Uttarājjhaya�[[AN2.1]] in Charpentier 1922:
74,18.
42 [[MA10]] at T I 432c6, T 31 at T I 814a4, and D (4094) mngon pa, ju 93b5 or Q (5595) tu 106b7. Although
this determination does not occur in [[MN2]] it recurs in other Pāli discourses, cf., e.g., [[MN70]] at MN I
481,1, [[SN12.22]] at SN II 28,24, [[SN21.3]] at SN II 276,12, [[AN4.1]] at AN I 50,9, and [[AN8.13]] at AN IV
190,8.
43 Premasiri 2005b: 569 comments that “while the fourth method proposes that one should cultivate the ability to endure certain conditions that are unavoidable, the fifth method proposes that whenever unnecessary
trouble is avoidable, it is wise to avoid it”. The Jain work Dasaveyāliya in a somewhat similar vein recommends avoiding various animals and places, cf. Lalwani 1973a: 62,13 (5.12) or Leumann 1932: 19,5 (5.12),
translated in Schubring 1932: 89.

mngon pa, ju 94a5 or Q (5595) tu 107b1. The Tibetan version introduces the development of the awakening factors by describing contemplation of the impermanent nature of the five aggregates.

kha. The Ekottarika-āgama version additionally has an exhortation to meditate and not
be negligent, lest one later regret it. [45]
Looking back on the different versions, the Sabbāsava-sutta and its Chinese and Tibetan parallels show a close agreement in regard to the seven methods for abandoning
the influxes, except for slightly different sequencing. The Āsava-sutta in the A�guttaranikāya differs from the other versions in that it does not include the method concerned
with “seeing”. The exposition in the Āsava-sutta also starts on a different premise, as it
examines the qualities that make a monk worthy of respect and offerings. This difference
raises the question of how far the first method of “seeing” forms an integral part of the
set of methods for overcoming the influxes. [46]
According to other Pāli and Chinese discourses, the path to the eradication of the influxes is the noble eightfold path. [47] This provides a link between the seven methods for
abandoning the influxes described in the present discourse and the noble eightfold path.
In view of this affinity, the placement of “seeing” in the first position in the Sabbāsavasutta and its Chinese and Tibetan parallels mirrors the primacy of right view in the noble
eightfold path. [48] According to the Mahācattārīsaka-sutta and its Chinese and Tibetan
parallels, right view is in fact the forerunner of the noble eightfold path. [49] The position of
right view as the first factor of the path is noteworthy, since in this way the sequence of
the noble eightfold path places wisdom first, [50] followed by morality and concentration,
whereas in other contexts one regularly finds the sequence: morality, concentration, wisdom. The noble eightfold path’s departure from this sequence highlights the function of
right view as the all-important directional input for the practice of the path. The point
made in this way is that without the guiding principle provided by right view, neither the
noble eightfold path nor the methods for overcoming the influxes, listed in the Sabbāsava-sutta and its Chinese and Tibetan versions, will lead to deliverance.

45 [[EA40.6]] at T II 741b13. The same type of exhortation occurs frequently in the Pāli discourses, e.g., in the
Majjhima-nikāya in [[MN8]] at MN I 46,9, [[MN19]] at MN I 118,23, [[MN106]] at MN II 266,2, and [[MN152]] at
MN III 302,9.
46 Van Zeyst 1965: 640, however, is of the opinion that the presentation in [[AN6.58]] “has been partly excised
to make it fit into the Book of Sixes”.
47 E.g., [[MN9]] at MN I 55,12, with its Chinese parallels [[MA29]] at T I 462a16 and [[SA344]] at T II 94c22.
48 In addition to the relationship between “seeing” and right view, “restraining” the senses could be considered as belonging to the domain of right effort; “using” one’s requisites properly as representing right livelihood for a monk or a nun; successfully “removing” unwholesome thoughts would amount to right intention; and “developing” the factors of awakening, which forms one of the contemplations listed in the Satipa��hāna-sutta, would be an instance of right mindfulness.
49 [[MN117]] at MN III 71,23: “right view comes first”, sammādi��hi pubba�gamā hoti, a statement found similarly in its parallels [[MA189]] at T I 735c13: and D (4094) mngon pa, nyu 44b6 or Q (5595)
thu 84a8: yang dag pa’i lta ba sngon du ’gro ba. Bodhi 1984: 14 comments that “to attempt to enter the
practice [of the noble eightfold path] without a foundation of right view is to risk getting lost in the futility
of undirected movement”.
50 [[MN44]] at MN I 301,9 and its parallels [[MA210]] at T I 788c12 and D (4094) mngon pa, ju 7b6 or Q (5595)
tu 8b5 identify right view as a factor that belongs to the aggregate of wisdom.

34   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


A closer examination of the Sabbāsava-sutta brings to light a noteworthy difference
between its treatment of the method of “seeing” and its treatment of the other methods.
While one who undertakes the six other methods is a “monk”, the one who undertakes
the first method of “seeing” is a “noble disciple”. [51] The expression “noble disciple” covers not only monastics, but also lay disciples. This presentation would thus agree with
the Āsava-sutta in associating the remaining six methods more closely to monks. The implication could be that whereas “seeing” the four noble truths is mainly a matter of attaining stream-entry, the remaining methods are more closely related to undertaking
mental training and practice towards achieving the higher stages of awakening, for which,
from an early Buddhist perspective, going forth as a monk or a nun provides the best conditions. Understood in this way, the Āsava-sutta might be concerned with a monk who is
already a disciple in higher training (sekha), whereas the Sabbāsava-sutta and its parallels
would be broader in scope, since by including the method of “seeing” they also cover the
method most closely related to becoming a disciple in higher training.


### [[MN3]] Dhammadāyāda-sutta
The Dhammadāyāda-sutta, the “discourse on heirs in the Dharma”, reports a brief instruction by the Buddha, which is followed by an explanation given by Sāriputta. This
discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama and in the Ekottarika-āgama. [52]

MN I 12  The Dhammadāyāda-sutta and its two Chinese parallels open with an exhortation given
by the Buddha to the monks that they should accord priority to the Dharma and not to
material things, since to seek after material things would bring reproach on them and also
on their teacher. [53]

MN I 13  The three versions draw out the implication of this exhortation with the help of a hypothetical situation in which the Buddha would offer leftover food from his own meal to


51 [[MN2]] at MN I 8,32: sutavā ... ariyasāvako.
52 The parallels are [[MA88]] at T I 569c-571b, entitled “discourse on seeking the Dharma”,, and [[EA18.3]] at T II 587c-589a. While [[MN3]] and [[EA18.3]] take place in Jeta’s Grove by Sāvatthī, the capital of Kosala, [[MA88]] locates the discourse in a grove near the village Pañcasālā in the same district of Kosala. A
village Pañcasālā is also mentioned in [[SN35.27]] at SN I 113,29 (or SN [2] 154 at SN [2] I 252,16), which is, however, situated in the district of Magadha. Comments on [[MA88]] can be found in Minh Chau 1964/1991: 30,
58, and 205. [[EA18.3]] has been translated by Huyen-Vi 1995: 51-57.
53 [[MN3]] at MN I 12,14 refers to being a “heir”, dāyāda, in the Dharma or in material things, [[MA88]] at T I
570a2 speaks of “seeking” for these two,, and [[EA18.3]] at T II 587c28 instructs to keep the gift of Dharma in mind instead of training for [the sake of] material gifts, . While in [[MN3]] and [[MA88]] the Buddha just continues his exposition, according to [[EA18.3]] at T II 588a1 at this point the monks
beg the Buddha to explain in more detail what he meant. The image of becoming a “heir” 求法經, dāyāda, to the
Buddha’s teachings recurs in, e.g., [[SN35.95]] at SN IV 72,17, [[SN47.3]] at SN V 143,7, [[AN4.254]] at AN II
248,21, [[AN8.63]] at AN IV 299,18, Th 1058, Th 1168-1169, and Thī 63. [[MA88]] at T I 569c26 also differs
from [[MN3]] and [[EA18.3]] in that it gives a listing of the names of chief disciples who were present on this
occasion.

two hungry monks. In contrast to one of these monks, who takes the food, the more praiseworthy of the two monks does not accept the food in order to avoid succumbing to the
attraction of material things. [54]
The Madhyama-āgama discourse next describes the detrimental situation of a teacher,
who practises seclusion himself, but whose disciples do not follow their teacher’s example. Having said that much, in the Madhyama-āgama account the Buddha indicates that
he has back pain and asks Sāriputta to continue instructing the monks. [55]
In the Majjhima-nikāya version, however, the Buddha had already retired into his dwelling after having described the behaviour of the two monks in regard to the leftover food,
without broaching the topic of seclusion. [56] According to the Pāli discourse, it was Sāriputta who then addressed the monks by broaching the topic of a teacher who dwells in
seclusion, while his disciples do not follow this example.
The Ekottarika-āgama account also reports that the Buddha left right after describing
the two monks’ behaviour in regard to his leftover food. In the Ekottarika-āgama version,

54 Mahāsi 1982/2006a: 20-21 explains that “the monk who restrains his desire to the point of declining the
Buddha’s offer of food ... will be able to ... cultivate contentment ... [and] will not get disheartened in the
face of hardships and privations”.
55 [[MA88]] at T I 570b22. Several Pāli discourses report a similar situation, with the Buddha taking a rest due
to back pains and asking one of his eminent disciples to deliver a discourse in his stead, cf., e.g., [[DN33]] at
DN III 209,17, [[MN53]] at MN I 354,24, [[SN35.202]] at SN IV 184,7, and [[AN10.67]] at AN V 123,1. These instances differ from [[MA88]] in as much as in each case it is late at night and the Buddha has already spent a
considerable amount of time in giving a discourse. Another such instance can be found in the Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1977: 6,10+20, according to which the Buddha told one of his disciples that he had
back pains and wanted to rest, asking the disciple to answer a question about the origin of the Sakyans in
his stead. According to the Sa�ghabhedavastu account, the real reason for delegating the question to one
of his disciples was that the Buddha wanted to avoid answering it himself, as he thought that if he were to
disclose the origins of the Sakyans this might be misunderstood as self-praise on his part. Thus in the Sa�ghabhedavastu account the Buddha refers to his back pain mainly as a polite excuse in order to be able to
hand over the teaching duty to one of his disciples. A similar perspective on the Buddha’s back pain can
be found in some Pāli commentaries. The Dīgha-nikāya commentary on the above quoted passage simply
explains the Buddha’s back pain to be an after-effect of the ascetic practices undertaken before his awakening, Sv III 974,16: bhagavato hi chabbassāni mahāpadhāna� padahantassa mahanta� kāyadukkha�
ahosi. athassa aparabhāge mahallakakāle pi��hivāto uppajji, so that from its perspective the Buddha appears to have had real pain and needed to take a rest. The Majjhima-nikāya commentary and the Sa�yuttanikāya commentary, Ps III 28,13 and Spk III 52,14, however, record also an alternative explanation, according to which the Buddha wanted to make use of the new hall of the Sakyans in all four postures, santhāgārasāla� pana catūhi iriyāpathehi paribhuñjitukāmo ahosi. They explain that in speaking of back
pain the Buddha only used the slight discomfort caused by the sitting posture as a polite excuse. A similar
perspective can be found in the A�guttara-nikāya commentary, Mp V 44,18, with the difference that according to its presentation the Buddha mentioned his back pain because he wanted to give his disciple an
occasion to deliver teachings, therassa okāsakara�attha� evam āha. These commentarial explanations
seem to reflect a tendency of glossing over physical afflictions of the Buddha, which would no longer have
been compatible with the status accorded to him in later times. For a discussion of another manifestation
of the same tendency, in relation to the Buddha’s last meal, cf. [[AN2006]]
56 According to Ps I 99,1, the Buddha had left thinking that Sāriputta would continue his discourse.


36   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


the listening monks then wonder who could give a detailed explanation of this short instruction of the Buddha and finally decide to approach Sāriputta. [57]
In the Majjhima-nikāya discourse, it is not obvious why Sāriputta should turn to the
topic of seclusion right after the Buddha had brought up the example of the behaviour of
the two monks towards his leftover food. Here the Madhyama-āgama version helps to
bridge the two topics, since in its account it was the Buddha who had raised the subject
of seclusion, so that here Sāriputta simply takes up a topic that had already been broached
by the Buddha.

MN I 14 The Madhyama-āgama version continues with Sāriputta asking the other monks for
their understanding of the Buddha’s statement about living in seclusion. In reply, two
monks expressed their opinion by describing the delight that other monks experience
when a senior monk declares to have reached the final goal or when they witness a monk
of middle standing or even a new monk who is intent on reaching awakening. [58] According to the Madhyama-āgama account, Sāriputta was not satisfied with these replies and
presented his way of understanding the Buddha’s statement. He did so by contrasting
three grounds for blame incurred by those who do not train in seclusion with three grounds
for praising monks who train in seclusion and thereby follow their teacher’s example.
While in the Majjhima-nikāya and the Ekottarika-āgama versions Sāriputta’s exposition also begins by putting a question to the other monks, in these two versions this query
appears to be merely a rhetorical question. [59] Instead of expressing their own opinion on
the matter, the monks simply ask Sāriputta to explain, in reply to which he takes up the
same three grounds for blame or praise as found in the Madhyama-āgama discourse.
By examining the grounds for blame and praise, Sāriputta’s exposition takes up the
contrast between reproach and absence of reproach mentioned in the Buddha’s initial
statement at the outset of the discourse, according to which monks who seek after material things will bring reproach onto themselves and also onto their teacher.
The Madhyama-āgama presentation offers an additional rationale for Sāriputta’s treatment of the contrast between the blameworthy neglect of seclusion and its praiseworthy
opposite. Its account suggests that Sāriputta’s exposition serves to counterbalance the
one-sided interpretation of the two monks. By discussing the blameworthiness of neglecting seclusion, Sāriputta’s exposition highlights that the important distinction is not
whether one delights in the practice of others, but whether one avoids the blame incumbent on not dedicating oneself to the practice of seclusion.

MN I 15  The Dhammadāyāda-sutta and its two parallels agree that Sāriputta concluded his explanation by listing a standard set of mental defilements and by presenting the noble


57 [[EA18.3]] at T II 588a26. This, too, is a common procedure in the Pāli discourses, thus one finds the monks
asking Mahākaccāna to explain a brief saying made by the Buddha in [[MN18]] at MN I 110,22, [[MN133]] at
MN III 194,9, [[MN138]] at MN III 224,3, and [[AN10.172]] at AN V 255,24; Ānanda is asked to do the same
in [[SN35.116]] at SN IV 94,1, [[SN35.117]] at SN IV 98,28, and [[AN10.115]] at AN V 225,20.

eightfold path as the path to their removal and to the attainment of awakening. [60] The
Madhyama-āgama version concludes with the Buddha expressing his approval of Sāriputta’s exposition, [61] while the other two versions only report that the monks rejoiced in
Sāriputta’s exposition. [62]


### [[MN4]] Bhayabherava-sutta

The Bhayabherava-sutta, the “discourse on fear and dread”, expounds the difficulties
of living in seclusion. This discourse has a parallel in the Ekottarika-āgama. [63] A few
parts of a parallel to the Bhayabherava-sutta have also been preserved in the form of
Sanskrit fragments. [64]
The Bhayabherava-sutta and its Chinese parallel report a visit paid by the Brahmin
Jā�usso�i to the Buddha, during which Jā�usso�i takes up the Buddha’s inspirational
role as a leader for his disciples and the difficulties of living in seclusion and solitude. [65]


60 [[MN3]] at MN I 15,25, [[MA88]] at T I 571a29, and [[EA18.3]] at T II 588c25. In its treatment of these defilements, [[MA88]] seems to make the additional point that the task is not only to abandon mental defilements,
but also to go beyond aversion to these mental defilements. Thus, in relation to thoughts of desires, [[MA88]]
at T I 571a29 explains that “sensual thoughts are evil, aversion to sensual thoughts is also evil”,
, and describes how one “removes sensual thoughts and also removes the aversion towards
sensual thoughts”, (my translation follows a suggestion in the Madhyamaāgama edition vol. 2 p. 775 note 2, according to which the first stands for _è_, “unwholesome” or “bad”,
while the second stands for w _ù_, “to loathe”, “to dislike”; on this polyphonic character cf. also Bucknell
1999a: 59).
61 [[MA88]] at T I 571b13.
62 [[MN3]] at MN I 16,11 and [[EA18.3]] at T II 589a7.
63 The parallel is [[EA31.1]] at T II 665b-667a, parts of which have been translated by Bareau 1963: 37-39 and
68; for a full translation cf. Anālayo 2011c. [[EA31.1]] agrees with [[MN4]] in locating the discourse in Jeta’s
Grove by Sāvatthī. The summary verse at T II 673c11 refers to [[EA31.1]] as “higher”,, perhaps an ab- 念欲惡,
惡念欲亦惡 breviation of, the “higher mind”, which is found in [[EA31.1]] at T II 666b21 (in fact, this whole
chapter of EĀ is called the 彼斷念欲, “chapter [on what is] higher 亦斷惡念欲 ”,, a title presumably taken from its first 佛光
discourse, [[EA31.1]]). 惡
64 The Sanskrit fragments are SHT I 164c+g (p. 93, identified in Schlingloff 1967: 421), SHT IV 32 folios 惡
33-41 (pp. 128-134), SHT IV 165 folios 15-16 (pp. 190-191, cf. also SHT VII p. 240), SHT IV 500 folio 4
(pp. 221-222), and SHT IX 2401 (p. 195). SHT IV 32 folio 33 agrees with [[MN4]] on the location of the discourse. SHT IV 500 folio 4 has a few words paralleling the Brahmin’s first question at MN I 16,20; SHT
IV 32 folios 34-36 correspond to the recurring reference to dwelling in lonely places in the forest, found,
e.g., at MN I 17,12; SHT IV 32 folio 37 and 38, SHT IV 165 folio 15, and SHT IX 2401 describe the Buddha attaining the first and the fourth absorption, as well as turning the mind to recollection of past lives, 增上
paralleling MN I 21, 增上之心 34 and MN I 22,10. SHT IV 32 folio 41 corresponds to the concluding part of [[MN4]] at
MN I 23,34 and MN I 24,8. A reference to the present discourse as the 增上品 (bhaya)[bh]airavaparyāye can be
found in SHT I 36A2 (p. 27) and in SHT IV 36V2 (p. 259). Hartmann 2004b: 126 notes another parallel
among the newly discovered Dīrgha-āgama preserved in Sanskrit fragments.
65 [[MN4]] at MN I 16,20 and [[EA31.1]] at T II 665b19. The difficulties of living in seclusion come up again in
[[AN10.99]] at AN V 202,4.



MN I 16


38   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


The two versions differ in so far as they have these two topics in the opposite order
(see table 1.3). According to the Majjhima-nikāya version, the Brahmin first spoke of the
Buddha’s role as a leader and then turned to the difficulties of a solitary life in the forest.
On reading the Pāli account, these two statements seem like two separate ideas the Brahmin had on his mind.
According to the Chinese version, however, the Brahmin first spoke of the difficulty of
living in seclusion and then turned to the Buddha’s role as a guide and inspiration for his
disciples. The Ekottarika-āgama discourse, moreover, explains that it is precisely due to
seeing the Buddha that his disciples get a sufficiently strong sense of urgency that motivates them to retire into seclusion on mountains and in caves. [66]


Table 1.3: Main Topics in [[MN4]] and [[EA31.1]]

|[[MN4]]|[[EA31.1]]|
|---|---|
|Brahmin notes Buddha’s role as guide (1)<br>Brahmin refers to dwelling in solitude (2)<br>Buddha gives his autobiography (3)|Brahmin refers to dwelling in solitude (→ 2)<br>Brahmin notes Buddha’s role as guide (→ 1) <br>Buddha gives his autobiography (→ 3)|



With this additional information, a relation between these two statements emerges.
Thus the main topic that, according to the Ekottarika-āgama account, the Brahmin Jā�usso�i had in mind was the difficulty of living in seclusion. That the disciples of the
Buddha nevertheless engaged in such seclusion he then attributed to the inspirational role
of the Buddha as their teacher.
This reasoning of the Brahmin finds its confirmation in both discourses in the Buddha’s
detailed account of his own practice of seclusion and consequent attainment of awakening, thereby filling out in detail what made him a guide and inspiration for his disciples.
In this way, the Ekottarika-āgama’s presentation clarifies why the Brahmin would come
out with these two statements and why the Buddha would dwell at length on his own
practice of seclusion and attainment of awakening.

MN I 17  The two versions continue by turning to the case of recluses and Brahmins who practise impure bodily, verbal, or mental conduct, who are of impure livelihood or under the
influence of a set of unwholesome qualities. In contrast to such recluses and Brahmins,
the Buddha found solace in living in seclusion, due to his purified conduct and due to his
freedom from unwholesome qualities. [67]
Regarding the listing of these unwholesome qualities, the two versions show some variations (see table 1.4). Qualities mentioned in both versions are:


66 [[EA31.1]] at T II 665c1 speaks of the disciples experiencing “embarrassment” or “shame”,, on seeing
the Buddha, which in the present context seems to convey a sense of “urgency”, sa�vega.
67 While according to [[MN4]] at MN I 17,21 the Buddha “found even more solace” in forest seclusion, bhiyyo
pallomam āpādi�, [[EA31.1]] at T II 665c9 indicates that he “delighted in seclusion, [experiencing] increasing joy”, .

  - the habit of disparaging others and lauding oneself,

  - the presence of fear,

  - desires for material gains,

  - the absence of energy,

  - the absence of mindfulness,

  - the absence of concentration,

  - the absence of wisdom.
The Majjhima-nikāya version additionally lists manifestations of the five hindrances. [68]
To mention the five hindrances as part of the unwholesome states to be overcome fits the
present context well, as both versions later on turn to the attainment of the four jhānas.

The Bhayabherava-sutta and its Chinese parallel next describe how the Buddha –
during the time when he was still a bodhisattva – confronted fear, which could arise
because of external circumstances, such as noise caused by wild animals passing by,
when being alone in the forest. [69] In this case, he would not change posture until the fear


68 [[MN4]] at MN I 17,32 and MN I 18,4+14+23+32: abhijjhālū ... byāpannacittā ... thīnamiddhapariyu��hitā ...
uddhatā avūpasanatacittā ... ka�khī vecikicchī (B [e] -M I 22,20 and S [e] -M I 32,9: vicikicchī, C [e] -M I 42,21:
avupasantaº), which, although not employing exactly the same terminology as usually found in listings of
the five hindrances, do correspond to the five hindrances in meaning.
69 The point of the present passage appears to be in particular the arising of fear caused by such external factors as noise, etc., as the case of fear related to a lack of internal purity has already been taken up in both
discourses earlier. The topic of the arising of fear when being alone in a forest recurs in [[SN1.15]] at SN I
7,3 (or SN [2] 15 at SN [2] I 14,2) and its parallels [[SA1335]] at T II 368b27 and SĀ [2] 355 at T II 490b8. While according to the commentary to [[SN1.15]] Spk I 35,1, fear had arisen to a deva, according to [[SA1335]] and
SĀ [2] 355 it was a monk who had become afraid, and who was then told by a deva that there was nothing to
be afraid of. For a survey of the arising of fear as described in [[MN4]] cf. also Weerasinghe 1997: 615-616;
on fear in general cf., e.g., Brekke 1999b and Karunaratne 1991; for a listing of eight qualifications for
dwelling in solitude according to the Jain tradition cf. �hā�a�ga 8.594 in Jambūvijaya 1985: 243,1.



MN I 20

had subsided. The Majjhima-nikāya version stands alone in reporting that he went to
particular shrines on auspicious nights to encounter frightful situations. [70]

MN I 21  The Majjhima-nikāya account continues with the Buddha referring to some recluses and
Brahmins who mistake day for night, or night for day. In contrast to these, the Buddha
recognized day as being day and night as being night. The Majjhima-nikāya version
highlights that due to this ability he rightly deserves praise as a being free from delusion,
who has appeared in the world for the benefit and welfare of gods and men. [71]
The Pāli commentary takes this statement in a literal sense and describes how someone
attains jhāna with a white kasi�a and emerges from this jhāna during the night. Due to
the nature of the kasi�a, he mistakes night for day. Or else some birds usually active only
during the day may chirp at night and cause someone who hears them from inside a dwelling to mistake night for day. [72] These commentarial explanations appear somewhat contrived and do not fit the presentation in the Bhayabherava-sutta too well, since the statement in the discourse does not seem to be concerned with only a momentary mistaking
of night for day.
The Pāli commentary is evidently trying to find some way of making sense of this passage, since is it difficult to imagine someone mistaking day for night or night for day. It
is also somewhat perplexing that, just because of being able to recognize day as day, one
should be considered as a being free from delusion who has appeared in the world for the
benefit of gods and men.
The Ekottarika-āgama discourse has preserved this statement in a somewhat different
manner. According to its report, the Buddha instead pointed out that some recluses and
Brahmins, whether it be day or night, do not understand the path of Dharma. In contrast
to these, the Buddha does understand the path of Dharma, whether it be day or night. [73]


70 [[MN4]] at MN I 20,27. On the auspicious dates listed in [[MN4]] cf. Dietz 1997. Perhaps the present instance
in [[MN4]] intends to depict a pre-awakening belief the bodhisattva may have had in the auspiciousness of
particular dates and places, since in general, as pointed out by von Simson 1995: 172, “the powers of nature and the sacredness of place and time are as unimportant in the Buddhist doctrine as are the year myths
and fertility rites”. In fact, even the adoption of the ancient Indian custom of regularly convening the monks
on uposatha days was, according to Vin I 101,20, because of a suggestion by King Bimbisāra, who had
seen other ascetics gain lay support by this practice and wanted the Buddhist monks to do the same.
71 [[MN4]] at MN I 21,20. The same praise recurs in [[MN12]] at MN I 83,14. An extract from the present discussion already appeared in Anālayo 2005b: 2-3.
72 Ps I 121,18. The commentary works out both examples in the opposite way as well by describing how someone attains a jhāna with a dark kasi�a and emerges at daytime, and how someone hears the chirping of a
night bird during daytime. Jayatilleke 1973: 30 takes the passage in a symbolic sense, in that the Buddha’s
ability to recognize day as day and night as night implies that he “frankly accepts the existence of both
good and evil in the world of conditioned existence”.
73 [[EA31.1]] at T II 666b11: The expression regularly stands for the Buddha’s teaching, something other recluses and Brahmins might indeed not have fully understood, be it day or night.

This way of presenting the Buddha’s statement reads more straightforward than its Pāli
counterpart.
Although the Ekottarika-āgama presentation appears more straightforward, the Sanskrit fragment parallels support the Pāli reading. [74] Thus either a transmission error occurred early enough to affect the Pāli and Sanskrit versions, or else the Chinese translators rendered a knotty passage in such a way as to make it more easily comprehensible.
Be that as it may, the Bhayabherava-sutta and its Ekottarika-āgama parallel continue
with the Buddha’s attainment of the four jhānas. The Chinese version links these to the
joy experienced when retiring into seclusion, mentioned earlier in both versions, by reporting that the Buddha identified these jhānas to be his experience of happiness when
living in secluded places. [75]
The two versions continue with the Buddha’s attainment of the three higher knowledges. In both versions, the Buddha explains that his secluded life style should not be
misconceived as an indication that he still has to eradicate defilements, since his motivation for living in seclusion is simply the pleasure derived from such dwelling for himself,
and his concern for others. [76]
The second part of this statement, found in both versions, seems to imply that the Buddha’s way of teaching is not confined to verbal communication. By retiring into meditative seclusion, he sets an example to be emulated by those walking the path he taught.
This point comes out with additional clarity in the Ekottarika-āgama version, since in its
account the inspirational role of the Buddha’s own practice of seclusion is a prominent
theme throughout the whole discourse.
The two versions conclude by describing that the Brahmin Jā�usso�i was sufficiently
delighted by this discourse to take refuge. [77] In the Pāli discourses, this constitutes one out
of numerous instances in which he takes refuge. [78]

74 SHT IV 32 folio 37V2: (sa�)jñ[o] diva�se ca [d](i)vasa [sa], which would be a counterpart to [[MN4]] at

76 While [[MN4]] at MN I 23,35 speaks of the Buddha “having compassion for future generations”, pacchimañ
ca janata� anukampamāno, [[EA31.1]] at T II 666c25 refers to the same in terms of his motivation “to deliver sentient beings”, . The Buddha’s own comfort and his compassion for others as the two underlying reasons for his practice of seclusion recur in [[AN2.3]].9 at AN I 60,30.
77 [[MN4]] at MN I 24,7 and [[EA31.1]] at T II 667a1.
78 Other discourses that report the Brahmin Jā�usso�i taking refuge are, e.g., [[MN27]] at MN I 184,16, [[SN12.47]] at SN II 77,1, [[AN4.3]] at AN I 57,15, [[AN3.55]] at AN I 159,21, [[AN3.59]] at AN I 168,7, [[AN4.184]] at

The Ana�ga�a-sutta, the “discourse on [being] without blemishes”, is an exposition by
Sāriputta on what constitute blemishes for a monk. This discourse has three Chinese parallels, of which one is found in the Madhyama-āgama, one in the Ekottarika-āgama, and
the third is an individual translation. [79]
The four versions of this discourse agree that Sāriputta described four types of person:

  - those who are aware of the presence of blemishes,

  - those who are not aware of the presence of blemishes,

  - those who are aware of the absence of blemishes,

  - those who are not aware of the absence of blemishes.
In relation to these four, according to all versions those who are aware of their situation
(the first and third), are superior to those who are not aware of their situation (the second
and fourth).

MN I 25  The Pāli and Chinese versions introduce another monk at this point, who asks Sāriputta
to explain his statement further. While the Madhyama-āgama version and the individual
translation do not provide information about the identity of this monk, the Majjhima-nikāya and Ekottarika-āgama versions identify him to be Mahāmoggallāna. [80]
The four versions agree that one who is not aware of having a blemish will not make
an effort to overcome it, with the result that he will pass away without having overcome
that defilement. The Madhyama-āgama version and the individual translation add that
one who passes away without having overcome the blemish will meet with an unfavourable rebirth. [81]
The Ana�ga�a-sutta and its Chinese parallels compare this type of person to a dirty
bronze dish which, due to not being cleaned, becomes even dirtier. In contrast, one who
is aware of the presence of a blemish will strive to overcome it, comparable to a dirty
bronze dish cleaned regularly.

MN I 26  The problem with one who is not aware of the absence of a blemish – according to the
Ana�ga�a-sutta, the Madhyama-āgama version, and the individual translation – is that
he might neglect sense-restraint, with the result that desire will invade his mind. [82] The

has the title “discourse on blemishes”, (following a and variant), while T 49 is entitled
“discourse spoken by the Buddha on desires and wishes”, . The summary verse at T II 635b3
refers to [[EA25.6]] as “fetters”, . According to the information given in the Taishō edition, T 49 was translated by Făjù ( ). While [[MN5]] has Jeta’s Grove by Sāvatthī as its location, [[MA87]] and T 49 take place
at Bhesakalāvana, a grove situated near Su�sumāragiri in the Bhaggā country, and [[EA25.6]] has the Bamboo Grove at Rājagaha as its location. For remarks on [[MA87]] cf. Anesaki 1908: 48 and Minh Chau 1964/

Ekottarika-āgama version points out that such a person will not try to attain what still
has to be attained. [83] Hence, while the Ekottarika-āgama version only envisages stagnation, the other three versions speak of outright decline as the dire result of not understanding when one is free from a particular blemish. The four versions illustrate this case
with the example of a clean bronze dish that is not kept clean. The complementary case
of one who is aware of the absence of a blemish then corresponds to the example of a
dish that is kept clean.
Asked to explain the nature of blemishes, [84] according to all versions Sāriputta took up
various wishes a monk may have (see table 1.5). The four versions agree that a monk
who has committed an offence might wish that this does not become known, or he might
wish that at least he will not be admonished in public, or by someone inferior to him. [85]
The blemish surfaces once the opposite happens and the monk gets angry and upset.
The Majjhima-nikāya and Ekottarika-āgama versions indicate that a monk might also
wish to be the one of whom the Buddha asks a question. [86] The Madhyama-āgama version and the individual translation portray a similar wish, differing in so far as the monk
would like to be the one to ask the Buddha a question. [87]
According to the Majjhima-nikāya and Madhyama-āgama accounts, a monk might also
wish to receive the best food, water, and seat in the refectory. [88] The Ekottarika-āgama
version and the individual translation instead speak of a monk wanting to be the first to
receive food, water, and a seat. [89]
Another wish mentioned in all versions is to be entrusted with giving teachings. The
Majjhima-nikāya and Madhyama-āgama versions and the individual translation also take
up the wishes of a monk for requisites and respect, topics not covered in the Ekottarikaāgama version. [90]

MN I 30  According to the Ana�ga�a-sutta and its parallels, Sāriputta compared a monk who has
such wishes and reacts with anger when they are not fulfilled to a closed container filled
with something repulsive. Just as no one would wish to eat those repulsive contents, similarly other monks will not feel reverence towards a monk of this type. The Majjhima-nikāya and the Ekottarika-āgama versions explain that this will be so even if such a monk
undertakes any of the practices usually esteemed among monks, such as dwelling in se

should be done by someone who is superior,

clusion, subsisting only on alms, wearing rag robes, etc. [93] All versions compare the opposite case, when a monk does not have any of these unwholesome wishes, to a closed
container full of delicious food.
The Pāli and Chinese versions report that Mahāmoggallāna illustrated his joy at hearing Sāriputta’s admonition by relating a past event at Rājagaha, where someone had been
overjoyed while watching a cartwright perform a feat of workmanship just as if the cartwright knew the onlooker’s thought as to how this feat should be done. [94] The four versions conclude with Mahāmoggallāna declaring that monks seriously intent on the practice and possessed of good qualities will receive this instruction by Sāriputta with as
much joy as a pretty young girl fond of ornaments would joyfully receive a flower garland. [95]


### [[MN6]] Āka�kheyya-sutta

The Āka�kheyya-sutta, the “discourse on [what] one may wish”, describes some essential aspects of a monk’s life, the undertaking of which can lead to the fulfilment of a
range of wishes. This discourse has a Pāli parallel among the tens of the A�guttara-nikāya, and two Chinese parallels found in the Madhyama-āgama and in the Ekottarikaāgama. [96]
According to the four parallel versions, a monk may realize various wishes he may
have if he observes the disciplinary rules, lives in an empty and secluded place, and develops tranquillity and insight. [97]
The Madhyama-āgama discourse records a prelude to this statement. According to its
report, an unnamed monk had come to visit the Buddha to convey a reflection that had
occurred to him while being in seclusion. This reflection was that the Buddha had taught

93 [[MN5]] at MN I 31,5 and [[EA25.6]] at T II 633b15.
94 [[MN5]] at MN I 31,25, [[MA87]] at T I 569b14, [[EA25.6]] at T II 633c17, and T 49 at T I 841c26. [[MA87]] and T
49 at this point explicitly identify the speaker to be Mahāmoggallāna, so that in their account it seems as if
the monk who had put the earlier inquiry was a different person.
95 [[MN5]] at MN I 32,26, [[MA87]] at T I 569c5, [[EA25.6]] at T II 634a6, and T 49 at T I 842a15. The same simile
recurs in [[AN8.51]] at AN IV 278,5 and at Vin II 255,36.
96 [[AN10.71]] at AN V 131-133, [[MA105]] at T I 595c-596b, and [[EA37.5]] at T II 712a-c. [[AN10.71]] and [[MA105]] have the title “discourse on wishes”, Āka�kha-sutta/ . The three parallel versions agree with [[MN6]]
on locating the discourse in Jeta’s Grove by Sāvatthī. [[MA105]] has been studied and translated by Minh
Chau 1964/1991: 63, 107, and 223-227. For a discourse quotation in Abhidh-k-� cf. below note 101.
97 [[MN6]] at MN I 33,9, [[AN10.71]] at AN V 131,12, [[MA105]] at T I 595c22, and [[EA37.5]] at T II 712a14. A similar set of conditions leads, according to It 2:2:8 at It 39,15, to non-return or arahant-ship, notably with the
difference that instead of mentioning the need to observe the disciplinary rules, It 2:2:8 at It 39,9 speaks of
delight in seclusion, pa�isallānārāmā ... viharatha, pa�isallānaratā. [[MN32]] at MN I 213,16 and its parallels [[MA184]] at T I 727b3 and [[EA37.3]] at T II 710c24 in a similar vein begin a comparable set of conditions with delight in seclusion, instead of observance of the disciplinary rules. A passage similar to the
present reference in [[MN6]] to not neglecting meditation, etc., can be found in the Śrāvakabhūmi in Shukla
1973: 352,17 or ŚSG 2008: 14,7 and T 1579 at T XXX 449a 願經 4.

him the Dharma, and he was now fulfilling the precepts, staying in an empty place, not
neglecting jhāna, and being endowed with insight. This reflection of the monk then motivated the Buddha to deliver a more detailed exposition of the same theme. [98]
A prelude can also be found in the Ekottarika-āgama version, with the difference that
here a monk who was seated in the assembly listening to the Buddha had the wish of being
given a teaching by the Buddha. [99] The Buddha had become aware of this wish and thereon delivered the discourse.
Another difference between the parallel versions is that in the Pāli discourses the Buddha starts his exposition by admonishing the monks to observe the precepts scrupulously,
seeing danger in the slightest fault, an admonition not found at this junction in their Chinese parallels. [100]
Out of a range of possible benefits that a monk may expect when undertaking the way
of practice described above, the parallels agree on two benefits, which are:

      - the ability to attain the four jhānas,

      - the ability to reach the destruction of the influxes.
Other wishes to be fulfilled through such practice vary amongst the four versions (see
table 1.6), ranging from comparatively mundane aspirations, such as getting requisites, to
various meditative attainments. [101]
On considering the listings of a monk’s wishes in the four versions, it is noteworthy
that of the seventeen benefits enumerated in the Āka�kheyya-sutta of the Majjhima-nikāya, fifteen recur in its Madhyama-āgama parallel, while only eight of these seventeen
benefits can be found in the A�guttara-nikāya and Ekottarika-āgama versions. [102] Thus
the two Pāli discourses differ to a greater extent in regard to the benefits they mention
than the Majjhima-nikāya discourse and its Madhyama-āgama parallel.

MN I 36  According to the two Pāli versions, the Buddha concluded his exposition by repeating his
earlier admonition to perfectly observe the precepts, thereby presenting the entire discourse as a detailed explanation of this statement. [103]


98 According to [[MA105]] at T I 595c18 the Buddha gave his exposition with regard to this particular monk,
, a context also evident in [[EA37.5]] at T II 712a12:
. According to the Pāli commentarial tradition, however, the Ākankheyya-sutta should be reckoned
among discourses delivered by the Buddha of his own accord, Ps I 15,26: attano ajjhāsayen’ eva, i.e. not
spoken in relation to a particular situation or due to an external prompting.
99 [[EA37.5]] at T II 712a11.
100 [[MN6]] at MN I 33,5 and [[AN10.71]] at AN V 131,7. The same admonition recurs in [[AN4.12]] at AN II 14,12
and in It 4:12 at It 118,4.
101 A discourse quotation with the description of the peaceful liberations, mentioned as one of the aspirations
at [[MN6]] at MN I 33,34, can be found in Abhidh-k 2:15 and 8:3 in Pradhan 1967: 48,8 and 435,8 (not necessarily stemming specifically from the present discourse); cf. also T 1558 at T XXIX 17a1, T 1559 at T

102
[[AN10.71]] lists ten benefits, in line with its placing among the tens of the 丘 A�guttara-nikāya.
103 [[MN6]] at MN I 36,4: sampannasīlā ... viharatha ... iti yan ta� vutta�, idam eta� pa�icca vutta�, cf. also
[[AN10.71]] at AN V 133,5.


Chapter 1 Mūlapariyāya-vagga                                     -  47


This admonition is absent from the Madhyama-āgama version, although a comparable
injunction can be found in the Ekottarika-āgama discourse. [104] Thus the Madhyama-āgama discourse does not place any extra emphasis on scrupulous observance of the rules,
but rather presents observing the rules together with living in seclusion and developing
tranquillity and insight as equally important aspects of a monk’s training.

104 [[EA37.5]] at T II 712b24 concludes its listing of benefits by referring to “being afraid of a small transgression, what to say of a major one”, .
105 In relation to discontent, it is noteworthy that [[MN6]] at MN I 33,24 first speaks of discontent and delight,
aratiratisaho assa�, but then continues to mention only discontent, na ca ma� arati saheyya. The corresponding passage in [[AN10.71]] at AN V 132,14 continues to speak of both, but has variant readings for all
instances, including the first, which only refer to discontent. [[MA105]] at T I 596a1 mentions only discontent,, which in fact would fit the dynamics of the exposition better. The expression aratirati recurs
in [[MN119]] at MN III 97,20, where again the Chinese parallel [[MA81]] at T I 557b13 only mentions discontent,, cf. also below p. 677 note 170. Neumann 1896/1995: 1133 note 414 suggests to read arati-ratisaho in the case of [[MN119]] which might then give the sense of “totally conquering discontent” (p. 897
he translates: “über Unmut hat man Gewalt”, although on p. 35 in relation to [[MN6]] he translates “der Unmutslust will ich Herr sein”, thereby evidently reading: 少過常恐, 何況大者 arati-ratisaho). I am not aware of another occurrence of ati + √sah in the Pāli discourses that would support Neumann’s suggestion. Hecker 1972: 38,
commenting on Neumann’s suggestion, remarks that the next quality in [[MN6]] at MN I 33,27 only employs ºsaho, without ati. Aratī is also the name of one of the daughters of Māra, where Bingenheimer
2007: 56-57 suggests it would better fit with the other two daughters Ta�hā and Rāga if she were to be
named Ratī, a reading he also sees as underlying the way her name has been rendered into Chinese; on the 不樂
three daughters of Māra cf. also Johnston 1936/1995b: 188 note 3.

In a similar vein, the Ekottarika-āgama version places its reference to beware of transgressions within a wider context, as its exposition continues with a listing of the five aggregates of morality, concentration, wisdom, liberation, and knowledge-and-vision of
liberation. [108]
According to the Pāli commentary, however, the entire Āka�kheyya-sutta should be
seen as an exposition of the benefits of moral conduct. [109] This explanation by the Pāli
commentary seems to reflect a slight tendency to overrate strict observance of the rules.
Although the importance of a sound foundation in moral conduct is certainly seen in the


106 From the viewpoint of textual transmission it is noteworthy that [[MA105]] at T I 596a20 has a somewhat
truncated reference to the destruction of the influxes in its description of the wish to reach the immaterial
attainments. Next come the wishes to attain supernormal powers, the divine ear, the ability to read another’s mind, recollection of one’s past lives, the divine eye, and then again the destruction of the influxes, i.e. all these come together as one single wish. If [[MA105]] at an earlier stage should have proceeded from the immaterial attainments directly to the destruction of the influxes, as suggested by the
truncated reference at that point, its list of wishes would have been similar to [[AN10.71]] in this respect,
which proceeds directly from the four jhānas to the destruction of the influxes (though unlike [[MA105]]
[[AN10.71]] also does not mention the immaterial attainments). However, the passage at T I 596a20 may
rather reflect a general problem in the transmission or translation of the Madhyama-āgama, since similarly
truncated references to the destruction of the influxes in the context of a description of the immaterial attainments recur elsewhere in the same collection, where they are also followed by a listing of supernormal
powers that includes the destruction of the influxes, cf. [[MA81]] at T I 557c3 and [[MA147]] at T I 659a21.
107 [[EA37.5]] at T II 712a26 first mentions knowing the thoughts in the mind of another, and then at T II 712a28
describes knowing the states of mind of living beings as its next quality, an ability illustrated with the help
of a listing of states of mind comparable to what is found in [[MN6]] at MN I 34,26.

early discourses as an indispensable prerequisite for the gradual training of a monk and
thus for all of the various benefits mentioned in the present discourse, the requirements
the Āka�kheyya-sutta envisages for having one’s wishes fulfilled do not seem to be just
strict observance of the rules. Rather, what seems to be required is progressing from a
sound foundation in moral conduct to the development of tranquillity and insight, for
which purpose one should dwell in seclusion. This becomes particularly evident in the
Madhyama-āgama version, which does not have the admonition to observe the precepts
perfectly and to see danger in the slightest fault at all, found at the beginning and end of
the two Pāli discourses.
While the A�guttara-nikāya version does not have a formal conclusion, the Majjhimanikāya and Ekottarika-āgama versions report the delighted reaction of the monks. [110]
According to the Madhyama-āgama discourse, the monks were so inspired by this exposition that they immediately went off into seclusion to practise diligently and soon became arahants. [111] In this way, the conclusion of the Madhyama-āgama discourse again
highlights that the question at stake is not merely observance of the precepts, but rather
an integral practice of all aspects of the path.


### [[MN7]] Vatthūpama-sutta [112]

The Vatthūpama-sutta, the “discourse on the simile of the cloth”, features an exposition on the nature of mental defilements. This discourse has four Chinese parallels, one
of which is found in the Madhyama-āgama, another parallel is found in the Ekottarikaāgama, while the remaining two are individual translations. [113] Besides these four parallels, the final part of the Vatthūpama-sutta, which is concerned with ritual bathing in [[AN110]] [[AN10.71]] at AN V 133,9, [[MN6]] at MN I 36,8, and [[EA37.5]] at T II 712c4.

112 The Burmese edition Be-MN I 43,10 has the title Vattha-sutta, “the discourse on the cloth”, cf. also Ps I
165,26.
113 The parallels are [[MA93]] at T I 575a-576a, [[EA13.5]] at T II 573c-575a, T 51 at T I 843c-844b, and T 582
at T XIV 966b-967a (I am indebted to Jan Nattier for having drawn my attention to the parallelism between T 582 and [[MN7]] and for sharing a draft translation of T 582 with me). According to the information given in the Taishō edition, T 51 was translated by an unknown translator, while T 582 was translated by Zhī Qīan ( ). [[MA93]] has the title “discourse on a Brahmin [practising] purification [through
ablutions in] water”, ; T 51 has the title “discourse spoken by the Buddha to a Brahmin

[[EA13.5]] with, which might intend the river Sundarikā, even though [[EA13.5]] at T II 574c10 instead refers to this river with . As the expression does not occur at all in [[EA13.5]] it seems
as if the translator(s) employed a different rendering for the name of the river Sundarikā in the discourse
and in the summary verses, a not uncommon type of irregularity in the Ekottarika-āgama. For remarks

river, has counterparts in two discourses found in the two Chinese Sa�yukta-āgama
translations. [114]

MN I 36  According to the Madhyama-āgama version and one of the individual translations, the
event described in the present discourse took place just after the Buddha had reached
awakening. [115]
While the Pāli version starts with the Buddha addressing the monks on his own, the
three Chinese versions report that the arrival of a Brahmin was the occasion for the delivery of the discourse. [116] The same Brahmin appears again at the end of all versions,
asking the Buddha about ritual bathing in holy rivers.
The Ekottarika-āgama version and one of the individual translations depict the arrival
of this Brahmin with additional detail. [117] According to their description, this Brahmin felt
quite confident when comparing himself with the Buddha, as he supported himself with
simple food, whereas the Buddha sometimes took rich food. According to both versions,
the Buddha had become aware of this thought of the Brahmin, which apparently motivated him to deliver the discourse.
The Vatthūpama-sutta starts its exposition with the simile of the cloth, followed by
listing sixteen mental defilements. [118] The Chinese versions follow the reverse sequence
by first listing the mental defilements, which in the Chinese versions count up to twentyone types (see table 1.7), followed by then illustrating their effect with the simile of the
cloth. [119]
The defilements found in the Pāli version are almost exclusively what could be reckoned as ‘societal’ defilements, in the sense of being states that negatively affect communal behaviour. [120]


114 The partial parallels are [[SA1185]] at T II 321a-b and [[SA2]] 98 at T II 408b-c. Anesaki 1908: 123 gives the
title “Sundarika”,, for [[SA1185]] A reference to SĀ [2] 98 in an uddāna at T II 410a1 similarly employs the abbreviated . A meeting of the Buddha with the Brahmin Sundarika on the bank of a river
occurs also in [[SN7.9]] at SN I 167 (or SN [2] 195 at SN [2] I 358) and in [[SNP3.4]] at [[SNP455-486]] although the
ensuing discourse is not related to purification through ablutions in water.
115 [[MA93]] at T I 575a22 and T 51 at T I 843c17 note that the Buddha had just reached awakening,
or, corresponding to the Pāli expression pa�hamābhisambuddho, to which T 51 at T I 843c17
adds that the Buddha was alone, . This does not fit too well with the circumstance that both versions report the presence of monks listening to the discourse, cf. [[MA93]] at T I 575a24 and T 51 at T I 843c20,
where both versions indicate that the Buddha addressed the monks when beginning his discourse,
; both versions also conclude by reporting the delight of these monks, cf. [[MA93]] at T I 576a13 and T
51 at T I 844b5. According to [[EA13.5]] at T II 573c 孫陀利 2, the Buddha was in fact surrounded by a large number of listeners. Cf. also Minh Chau 1964/1991: 56. 孫陀
116 As in the case of [[MN6]] the Chinese discourses thus stand in contrast to the Pāli commentary, which includes the Vatthūpama-sutta among the discourses delivered by the Buddha on his own initiative, Ps I

Although such qualities are likewise found in the Chinese versions, their respective
lists additionally cover mental defilements more closely related to the practice of the path,
such as the five hindrances. [121]
The Chinese versions also mention shamelessness and recklessness, two qualities often
found in similar lists in other Pāli discourses, but absent from the list of defilements in
the Vatthūpama-sutta. [122] The Madhyama-āgama version and one of the individual translations, moreover, include wrong views in their lists, as well as unlawful desires. [123]

Pāli listing – it is not easy to determine the precise correspondent among the various translations used in
the Chinese versions. Hence with the above survey I merely intend to convey a general impression of the
range of mental defilements listed.

The point made with the help of the simile of the cloth, according to the Majjhima-nikāya and Ekottarika-āgama versions, is that a dirty and stained cloth will not take dye
properly. [128] The Madhyama-āgama discourse and one individual translation instead describe a dirty cloth that is still stained even after much washing. [129]
The Madhyama-āgama and Ekottarika-āgama versions, as well as one of the individual translations, proceed from the removal of the twenty-one defilements they mention to
the development of the four brahmavihāras in the form of a boundless radiation. [130] The
Majjhima-nikāya discourse instead proceeds from overcoming the sixteen defilements
mentioned in its listing to perfect confidence in the three jewels (Buddha, Dharma, and
Sa�gha), an implicit reference to stream-entry, [131] and only turns to the brahmavihāras
later on (see table 1.8).
The Madhyama-āgama version and one of the individual translations conclude their
description of the radiation of the four brahmavihāras with the Buddha pointing out that
in this way an internal ‘bathing’ of the mind can be undertaken, different from an outer

who had been present during the delivery of the discourse asked the Buddha about purification by bathing in sacred rivers.

The same query occurs also in the Majjhima-nikāya and the Ekottarika-āgama versions,
although in their accounts the Buddha’s exposition continues further before this intervention happens. In the Ekottarika-āgama version, after having described the radiation of
the four brahmavihāras, the Buddha speaks of perfect confidence in the three jewels, [133] a
topic that already occurred earlier in the Majjhima-nikāya discourse (see above table 1.8).
In regard to the qualities of the three jewels, while the Majjhima-nikāya and the Ekottarika-āgama presentations of the qualities of the Buddha are similar, [134] they differ in

134 The counterpart in [[EA13.5]] at T II 574a28 to the epithet in [[MN7]] at MN I 37,18, according to which the
Buddha is the “unsurpassable leader of men to be tamed”, anuttaro purisadammasārathi (C [e] -M I 86,26:
purisadammasārathī), treats this as two qualities: the “unsurpassable man”,, and the “charioteer
of the path of Dharma”, . Nattier 2003b: 227 notes that “has been the standard Chinese
rendition of the seventh of the Buddha’s epithets for many centuries” and explains that due to “having
taken anuttarapuru�a as a separate title, [the] ... translators were left to explain the epithet damyasārathi
on its own. In ... Prakrit languages ... damya would have been written damma ... Ignoring the unaspirated
character of the initial d-, this word was apparently read as dhamma, and the resulting *dhammasārathi
interpreted as ‘charioteer of the Dharma’”. A separation of the two parts of this compound can also be
found in the Bhai�ajyavastu of the Tibetan (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya in D (1) ’dul ba, kha 56a5: skyes
bu ’dul ba’i kha lo sgyur ba, bla na med pa, where the use of the shad (here represented by a comma)

relation to the Dharma. The Majjhima-nikāya version highlights that the Dharma is well
proclaimed, visible here and now, immediately effective, inviting inspection, leading onward, and to be experienced for oneself by the wise. [135] The Ekottarika-āgama version
instead describes the Dharma as very pure, unshakeable, respected and loved by the people. [136]
In relation to the Sa�gha, the two versions agree on speaking of the four pairs and the
eight persons. While the Majjhima-nikāya discourse proclaims that the Sa�gha’s members practise the good, straight, methodical, and proper way, [137] the Ekottarika-āgama version among others highlights that the members of the Sa�gha are accomplished in moral
conduct, concentration, wisdom, liberation, and knowledge-and-vision-of-liberation. [138]
The Ekottarika-āgama discourse continues its account with the acquisition of the three
higher knowledges, explaining that even taking delicious food will not constitute an obstacle for someone accomplished in this way, since all desires have been eradicated. [139] A
comparable remark can be found in one of the individual translations, where a detailed
description of various aspects of proper conduct that make one a worthy recipient of offerings leads up to the indication that in such a case taking good food and fine robes is not
blameworthy. [140]

MN I 38  The Vatthūpama-sutta has a similar reference to taking delicious food before its treatment of the brahmavihāras (see above table 1.8). [141] In the Pāli account, this passage is a
little surprising, placed as it is in between perfect confidence in the three jewels and the
development of the brahmavihāras, [142] and its implications remain somewhat unclear.
The Pāli commentary explains this statement to imply that non-return has been attained, since taking delicious food will not obstruct a non-returner from progress to full
awakening. [143] This explanation appears contrived. Although delicious food will indeed not
affect a non-returner or an arahant, being beyond the attraction of delicious food does not

separates “unsurpassed” from the “charioteer of men to be tamed” and thus treats them as two separate
epithets (though the same expression in Q (1030) ge 52a1 does not employ a shad at this point); cf. also
Skilling 1997a: 413 note 35. The same can also be found regularly in Madhyama-āgama discourses, e.g.,
in [[MA8]] at T I 429c20 or [[MA16]] at T I 438b21, just two mention two examples, cf. also Minh Chau 1964/

143 Ps I 174,22, an explanation perhaps based on [[SN12.63]] at SN II 99,8, according to which penetrative insight into the nutriment of edible food can lead via penetrative insight into the nature of the five types of
sensual pleasure to going beyond rebirth in this world. 甚為清淨, 不可移動, 人所愛敬

imply that one is at least a non-returner, since to remain unaffected by delicious food is
possible even if one has not yet reached such a lofty level of realization.
The Vatthūpama-sutta at this point speaks of aloofness from the attraction of food for
one who is of “such virtue, such nature, and such wisdom”. [144] Since the preceding passage spoke of perfect confidence in the three jewels, representative of stream-entry, the
introductory reference to “such virtue, such nature, and such wisdom” should refer to the
same level of awakening. Hence the formulation in the Vatthūpama-sutta does not support identifying this passage as representative of non-return. Perhaps the puzzling placement of the reference to taking delicious food at a point between a reference to streamentry and a reference to full awakening has led the commentary to give this explanation,
in an attempt to make sense out of this placement.
In contrast, in the Ekottarika-āgama version the placement of this passage seems more
natural, since by taking up this topic after full awakening it becomes clear that such
aloofness is just one of the qualities that result from having eradicated all defilements.
The same holds for the individual translation that has a comparable reference. Both versions also clarify the relation of this passage to the Vatthūpama-sutta as a whole, since it
was just such taking of delicious food by the Buddha that had caused the Brahmin to underestimate the degree of purity the Buddha had reached. Thus, in these two discourses,
the reference to the topic of delicious food forms a direct reply to this misconception of
the Brahmin, a misconception that apparently motivated the Buddha to deliver the entire
discourse. [145]
Another difference between the Majjhima-nikāya and the Ekottarika-āgama presentations is that the Vatthūpama-sutta does not refer to all of the three higher knowledges,
mentioned in its Ekottarika-āgama parallel, but only to the destruction of the influxes. [146]
The Majjhima-nikāya version precedes the destruction of the influxes with a brief description of the development of insight required for this lofty achievement, which speaks of
understanding that there is what is inferior, what is superior, and what goes beyond all
perceptions. [147] A counterpart to this passage is not found in the Ekottarika-āgama parallel.


144 [[MN7]] at MN I 38,10: eva� sīlo eva� dhammo eva� pañño.
145 The point conveyed in this way would be that the attitude to food is more important than the type of food
taken. As Stevens 1985: 441 explains, in contrast to some of the ascetic practices in vogue in ancient India, for the Buddha “it was the intention, not the food, that was paramount for enlightened eating”.
146 [[MN7]] at MN I 38,32.
147 [[MN7]] at MN I 38,31: “there is this, there is [what is] low, there is [what is] excellent, there is a higher escape from what pertains to perception”, atthi ida�, atthi hīna�, atthi pa�īta�, atthi imassa saññāgatassa
uttari� nissara�an ti. A similar statement recurs in [[AN3.66]] at AN I 196,32. A counterpart to this statement can be found in another discourse in the Madhyama-āgama, [[MA183]] at T I 726b27, in which case
the corresponding Pāli parallel, [[MN40]] at MN I 283, does not have such a statement (cf. below p. 261
note 282). It is noteworthy that [[MN7]] [[AN3.66]] and [[MA183]] agree on placing this statement after the
practice of the brahmavihāras, which suggests that the reference to what is “excellent”, pa�īta, intends
the brahmavihāras. According to the commentary Ps I 176,26, however, pa�īta stands for the fourth noble truth.


56   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


The Vatthūpama-sutta and its parallel in the Ekottarika-āgama continue by proclaiming that a monk who has destroyed the influxes is “bathed with an inner bathing”. [148] A
similar proclamation can also be found in the other versions. This inner bathing represents full awakening only in the Majjhima-nikāya and the Ekottarika-āgama discourses,
while in the Madhyama-āgama version and the individual translation the inner bathing
stands for the degree of mental purity achieved through the development of the brahmavihāras.
On hearing this proclamation, according to the Majjhima-nikāya discourse a Brahmin
visitor asked the Buddha about purification by bathing in sacred rivers. The Majjhima-nikāya version up to this point has not mentioned the presence of this Brahmin and in its
version the rationale for the Buddha’s remark on an inner bathing is not self-evident. The
commentary explains that the Buddha had been aware of this Brahmin’s potential to reach
awakening and had made this proclamation in order to arouse the Brahmin’s interest, as
this Brahmin was engaging in the practice of purification through (ritual) bathing. [149]
This part of the Vatthūpama-sutta occurs also in two Sa�yukta-āgama discourses, so
that this last section of the Pāli discourse has six Chinese parallels. Four of these six Chinese parallels have the bank of a river as their venue, thereby providing the fitting location for the present exchange about bathing in rivers. [150] The Madhyama-āgama discourse
and one of the individual translations, moreover, speak of the Buddha’s visitor as a Brahmin who practises water purification, while the two Sa�yukta-āgama versions and the
Ekottarika-āgama account refer to him as a Brahmin from the bank of a river, a place
where such purification through ablutions in water would take place. [151]


148 [[MN7]] at MN I 39,1: sināto antarena sinānena, [[EA13.5]] at T II 574c9: .
149 Ps I 177,5 introduces him as a nahānasuddhiko brāhma�o, a “Brahmin [intent on] purification through
bathing”.
150 [[MA93]] at T I 575a21, T 51 at T I 843c16, [[SA1185]] at T II 321a24, and [[SA2]] 98 at T II 408b25. Only [[EA13.5]] at T II 573c1 agrees with [[MN7]] on the location being Jeta’s Grove at Sāvatthī.
151 [[MA93]] at T I 575a23 speaks of the Buddha’s visitor as a Brahmin who practised “purification [through
ablutions in] water”, ; T 51 at T I 843c17 refers to him as a Brahmin who “speculates about purification [through ablutions in] water”, ; [[SA1185]] at T II 321a25 speaks of a Brahmin “from the bank
of the river Sundarikā”, ; SĀ [2] 98 at T II 408b26 of a “Brahmin who at that time was standing
on the bank of the river Sundarikā”, ; and [[EA13.5]] at T II 573c3 refers to him simply as a “river side” Brahmin, . While [[MN7]] speaks of this Brahmin throughout as 內極沐浴已
Sundarika Bhāradvāja, [[EA13.5]] at T II 575a2 uses a proper name only once he has become a monk and an
arahant, referring to him as the “venerable Sundarika”, . Spk I 233,7 explains that he was
called Sundarika after the river where he used to offer oblations (Bhāradvāja is the name of a Brahmin
clan, cf. Vin IV 6,23; on the Bhāradvājas cf. also Sarmah 1991). Enomoto 2002/2003: 241 points out that
ablution in water was one of the main Brahmanical practices of expiation or atonement, prāyaścitta. According to Gampert 1939: 255, sin was perceived as a form of dirt, hence ablution in water, often com- 水淨
bined with prayers to Varu�a, the god of water, was held to be a particularly efficacious means for remov- 計水淨
ing the stain of sin. The Jain tradition also took a critical stance towards purification through water, thus, 孫陀利河側
e.g., the Sūyaga�[[AN1.7]].14-16 in Vaidya 孫陀利河岸, 1928: 39 argues 時彼岸側有住婆羅門 that if water can purify, animals living in it should
also be purified, and if water can wash away evil, it should wash away merits as well. 江側

According to all versions, the Buddha explained to this Brahmin that bathing in rivers MN I 39
will not lead to purification. Instead of such ritual bathing, the Buddha recommended observance of moral conduct as the proper way to purification. [152]
The parallel versions conclude with considerable variations: MN I 40

 - one of the two Sa�yukta-āgama versions concludes by reporting that the Brahmin
approved of the Buddha’s explanation,

 - according to the other Sa�yukta-āgama version he was delighted by what he had
heard, [153]

 - the Madhyama-āgama discourse and one of the individual translations report that
he took refuge as a lay follower, [154]

 - according to the Majjhima-nikāya version, the Ekottarika-āgama account, and the
other individual translation, he went forth and became an arahant. [155]
The ending reported in the last mentioned three versions has a counterpart in a discourse
found in the Sa�yutta-nikāya and in the Sutta-nipāta, according to which the same Brahmin on another occasion approached the Buddha in order to offer him the remains of an
oblation. [156] During the ensuing discussion, the Buddha explained that to be a Brahmin
does not make one necessarily worthy of offerings and presented his perspective of what
leads to purity. The Sa�yutta-nikāya and Sutta-nipāta versions conclude by recording
that the Brahmin took refuge, went forth and in due time became an arahant. [157]
The meeting between this Brahmin and the Buddha narrated in the Sa�yutta-nikāya
and Sutta-nipāta discourses would have to be considered as their first meeting, since the
Brahmin did not recognize the Buddha. [158] As on this occasion the Buddha’s explanations

to Brahmins in verse in [[MN92]] and [[MN98]] as exemplifying that the Buddha was “sensitive to an auditor’s preference in rhetorical expression”, as he replied to those who had mastery of the Vedas “in their
own poetic argot”. The fourth stanza found in [[MN7]] at MN I 39,19 recurs in the Gāndhārī Dharmapada

had put into question the Brahmin’s belief in external forms of purification through offering oblations and his assumption of the superiority of being a Brahmin, it would make
sense for him to ask the Buddha on the related topic of purification through ritual bathing
in sacred waters on a later occasion, as reported in the Vatthūpama-sutta.
The introductory narration in the Ekottarika-āgama parallel to the Vatthūpama-sutta
and in one of the individual translations, according to which this Brahmin had been
trying to find fault with the Buddha for partaking of exquisite food, would also fit with
such an earlier meeting. It would be natural to imagine how this Brahmin might try to
find some faults after having been humbled by the Buddha’s reply on an earlier occasion.
Thus the only conflict between the accounts of these two meetings is their concluding
part, according to which the same Brahmin requested the going forth and eventually became an arahant on two different occasions. The Sa�yukta-āgama parallel to the earlier
meeting of this Brahmin with the Buddha does not have this contradiction, as this version
neither reports that the Brahmin became an arahant, nor indicates that he requested the
going forth. According to its account, on this earlier occasion he did not even take refuge,
but merely delighted in the Buddha’s exposition and left. [159] This ending would not stand
in any contrast to his going forth and becoming an arahant at the end of his later meeting
with the Buddha, described in the Vatthūpama-sutta and its parallels.
Perhaps his eventual going forth and becoming an arahant, reported in the Vatthūpamasutta, came to be part of the Sa�yutta-nikāya and Sutta-nipāta reports of the first meeting between Sundarika and the Buddha as the result of an error during the transmission
of the discourses.
Looking back on the Vatthūpama-sutta and its parallels, the seven versions of this discourse can be assembled into three groups, each of which gives a somewhat different
presentation of the Buddha’s exposition and of its effect on the Brahmin.
The two Sa�yukta-āgama versions offer the shortest and most simple account. Here
the Buddha meets a Brahmin on the bank of a river and the latter, apparently thinking
that the Buddha has come to take a ritual bath, brings up the subject of water purification.
In reply, the Buddha points out that real purification needs to be undertaken in the realm
of moral conduct, a reply that satisfies the Brahmin.
The Madhyama-āgama discourse and one of the individual translations additionally offer an account of mental purification. This account contrasts a host of mental defilements
with the development of the brahmavihāras. After presenting such development as an inner bathing, superior to a ritual bathing of the outer body, the topic of purification through
bathing in water comes in its place. As a result of the exposition given in these two discourses, the Brahmin interlocutor becomes a lay disciple.


recluse. Thus from the perspective of the narration in these two discourses, if Sundarika had met the Buddha on an earlier occasion, he would have recognized the Buddha and would not have wondered whether
the Buddha was a Brahmin.
159 [[SA1184]] at T II 321a22. Another parallel, [[SA2]] 99 at T II 409c12, agrees with [[SN7.9]] (or [[SN2]] 195) and [[SNP3.4]] as it concludes with the Brahmin going forth and becoming an arahant.


Chapter 1 Mūlapariyāya-vagga                                     -  59


The Majjhima-nikāya and Ekottarika-āgama discourses place a stronger emphasis on
the threefold perfect confidence of a stream-enterer and the destruction of the influxes.
According to their report, after the selfsame exchange with the Brahmin on water purification the Brahmin was so inspired that he went forth and became an arahant. The same
outcome is also reported in the other individual translation, which in other respects, however, differs from these two discourses.
Thus, while in the two Sa�yukta-āgama versions the discourse is concerned merely
with the inefficacy of water purification, in the Madhyama-āgama version and one of the
individual translation the emphasis is on the contrast between mental defilements and the
mental purity of the brahmavihāras, whereas in the Majjhima-nikāya discourse, the Ekottarika-āgama version, and the other individual translation full awakening as the proper
type of purification comes to the fore.
Regarding each of these three main modes of presentation, the Brahmin’s reaction fits
the depth of the discourse he has received.


### [[MN8]] Sallekha-sutta

The Sallekha-sutta, the “discourse on effacement”, expounds what constitutes real effacement. This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama and another parallel in
the Ekottarika-āgama. [160]
The Sallekha-sutta and its parallels begin with Mahācunda asking the Buddha how to
go beyond speculative views. [161] In the Majjhima-nikāya version, the Buddha replies by
recommending insight into the not-self nature of the very place where such views arise
(i.e., one’s own mind). [162] The Pāli commentary explains that this recommendation points


160 The parallels are [[MA91]] at T I 573b-574b and [[EA47.9]] at T II 784a-c. [[MA91]] is entitled “discourse on
Cunda’s inquiry [about] views”, . While [[MN8]] has Jeta’s Grove at Sāvatthī as its location,
[[MA91]] takes place at the Ghositārāma, a monastery in Kosambī, and [[EA47.9]] is located in the Squirrels’
Feeding Ground at Rājagaha.
161 [[MN8]] at MN I 40,16 refers to such speculative views as “views related to doctrines about the self or the
world”, attavādapa�isa�yuttā vā lokavādapa�isa�yuttā vā. [[MA91]] at T I 573b18 speaks of “views that
keep on arising, namely speculations about the existence of a self, speculations about the existence of a
being, about the existence of humans, about the existence of a person (puggala), about the existence of
life (jīvita), about the existence of the world”,
(in my translation I follow a suggestion made by Zacchetti 2005: 1269, who explains that in early translations of the second to sixth century, if occurs in a passage together with, it probably renders puggala or pudgala). [[EA47.9]] at T II 784a 周那問見經 11 simply mentions “all those views, related to past and future”,
.
162 [[MN8]] at MN I 40,21: “where those views arise, where they underlie, where they occur, when seeing that
with proper wisdom and in accordance with reality as: ‘this is not mine, this is not I, this is not my self’ ...
then those views are abandoned”, yattha c’ etā di��hiyo uppajjanti, yattha ca anusenti, yattha ca samudācaranti, ta� n’ eta� mama, n’ eso ’ham asmi, na me ’so attā ti evam eta� yathābhūta� sammappaññāya
passato ... evam etāsa� di��hīna� pa�inissaggo hoti (C [e] -MN I 94,3 c’ etā instead of ca for both instances).
Ps I 182,22 explains that the expression “where 諸見生而生, they arise”, yattha 謂計有神, uppajjanti 計有眾生,, refers 有人, to the 有壽, five aggregates. 有命, 有世

to the attainment of stream-entry, with which such views will be left behind. [163] The commentarial understanding of the implication of the present passage receives confirmation
from the Madhyama-āgama version, according to which the Buddha explained that the
experience of the cessation of phenomena (viz. Nirvā�a) leads beyond speculative views,
an implicit reference to stream-entry. [164] The Ekottarika-āgama version instead recommends insight into the place where such views arise and cease as being impermanent,
dukkha, and empty. [165]
The Ekottarika-āgama version continues differently from the other two discourses, as
it refers to the sixty-two types of view (presumably intending the listing of grounds for
views given in the Brahmajāla-sutta and its parallels) and then recommends becoming
established in the ten wholesome courses of action to go beyond such views.
According to the Sallekha-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel, the four jhānas or
the four immaterial attainments do not qualify as “effacement”. [166] Rather, effacement requires refraining from what is unwholesome even when faced with others who are indulging in it.

MN I 42  The list of unwholesome qualities in regard to which such effacement should be practised differs in the parallel versions. [167] The Ekottarika-āgama version lists only the ten
unwholesome courses of action. [168]
Although the main part of its presentation is based on these ten, the final part of the
Ekottarika-āgama discourse nevertheless refers to several other qualities mentioned also
in the Sallekha-sutta and its Madhyama-agama parallel. [169] This internal inconsistency, as
well as the overall somewhat unclear progression of ideas in the Ekottarika-āgama version, give the impression that this discourse has suffered from error(s) during its transmission and/or translation.
Although the Sallekha-sutta and its Madhyama-agama parallel resemble each other to
a greater extent, they also show some differences. Thus, while the Sallekha-sutta includes
wrong manifestations of the factors of the tenfold noble path, none of these form part of
the listing in the Madhyama-āgama version. Nor is the last item in the Sallekha-sutta’[[SN163]] According to Ps I 183,16, the expression “seeing with proper wisdom”, sammappaññāya passato, is a reference to the wisdom of stream-entry.
164 [[MA91]] at T I 573b23: “the complete and remainderless cessation of all phenomena, knowing like this and
seeing like this brings those views to extinction”, .
165 [[EA47.9]] at T II 784a12: “the sphere where these views emerge and arise, and where they cease, all that is
impermanent, dukkha, and empty”, (adopting the,,, and
variant instead of ).
166 “Effacement”, sallekha, in [[MN8]] at MN I 40,30, has its counterpart in in [[MA91]] at T I 573b25, literally “gradual reducing [faults]” (following the explanation in the Madhyama-āgama edition p. 787
note 8, which glosses as ).
167 The respective listings begin in [[MN8]] at MN I 42,3 and in [[MA91]] at T I 573c7.
168 [[EA47.9]] at T II 784a16.
169 [[EA47.9]] at T II 784c5 mentions praising oneself and disparaging others, not being of few wishes, breaches
of morality, laziness, not developing concentration, and not developing wisdom. 諸法滅盡無餘者, 如是知, 如是見, 令此見得滅

list, dogmatic adherence to one’s views, found in its Madhyama-āgama parallel (see
table 1.9).
Thus the three discourses agree on including unwholesome conduct or attitudes in the
form of:

 - killing,

 - stealing,

 - breaches of celibacy,

 - the four types of wrong speech,

 - covetousness.
The Sallekha-sutta and the Ekottarika-āgama version agree on continuing their listing
by also mentioning the remaining two unwholesome courses of action, namely:

 - ill will,

 - wrong view.
Unlike the Ekottarika-āgama discourse, the Sallekha-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama
parallel list various mental defilements and unwholesome qualities, such as:

 - anger,

 - deceit,

 - pride,

 - faithlessness,

 - shamelessness,

 - little learning,

 - laziness,

 - lack of mindfulness,

 - lack of wisdom.
To the last group, the Madhyama-āgama version adds being without concentration. [170]
The Sallekha-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama also agree on listing only three hindrances – sloth-and-torpor, restlessness, and doubt – out of the standard set of five hindrances. [171]
The Pāli commentary explains that the first two hindrances were not mentioned since
they had already been mentioned earlier, although under a different name. [172] Judging
from this pattern, described in the commentary, one would expect that the Sallekha-sutta’s list of defilements is built up in an economical way, in the sense that it does not repeat any item that has already been mentioned. Closer inspection shows that, while this
does hold for the case of wrong view, the same pattern has not been applied consistently
throughout the listing.

Wrong view, which constitutes the eleventh item in the list (11), constitutes at the same
time the last of the ten unwholesome courses of action and the first of the ten wrong path
factors. Hence, in keeping with the patter suggested by the commentary, wrong view is
only mentioned once (see above table 1.9). [173]
Yet, the same principle has not been consistently applied to the entire list of defilements, as an instance of overlap can be found, for example, between killing (2), stealing
(3) and breach of celibacy (4) on the one hand and wrong action (14) on the other, [174]
since wrong action covers precisely these three. [175]
Another overlap exists between falsehood (5), malicious speech (6), harsh speech (7)
and useless speech (8) on the one hand and the path factor of wrong speech (13) on the
other, [176] since here, too, the standard definition of wrong speech lists precisely these four
types of speech. [177]

173 [[MN8]] at MN I 42,18. An application of the same principle would also serve to explain why concentration
does not occur in the list given in [[MN8]] since wrong concentration is mentioned as one of the wrong path
factors, so that the list in [[MN8]] has in this way already covered this topic. In [[MA91]] however, an explicit
mentioning of concentration is required, since this version does not include the wrong path factors in its exposition.

(C [e] -MN III 216,1: pisunā).


64   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


Another at least partial overlap can be found between covetousness (9) and ill will (10)
on the one side and wrong intention (12) on the other, [178] since according to the standard
definition wrong intentions are intentions of sensuality, ill will and cruelty. [179] Without
these three types of intention, these three unwholesome mental qualities would have no
scope to arise. Moreover, the mentioning of wrong effort (16), wrong mindfulness (17)
and wrong knowledge (19) would have much in common with the later mentioned qualities of being lazy (41), unmindful (42) and lacking wisdom (43). [180]
Thus, on the basis of the commentarial suggestion, it seems as if several of the wrong
path factors are redundant. As the Madhyama-āgama discourse does not mention any of
the wrong path factors (nor are these found in the Ekottarika-āgama version), perhaps
the ten wrong path factors originally did not form part of the discourse. The occurrence
of wrong view as the last of the ten unwholesome courses of action could easily have
caused the reciter(s) to continue with wrong intention, wrong speech, etc., thereby, perhaps even unintentionally, adding a listing of then ten wrong path factors to the exposition. [181]

MN I 43  The Sallekha-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel continue by pointing out that
even just to arouse the mind to train in wholesomeness is of much benefit, a maxim that
depicts the type of repeated mental training that will enforce one’s resolve to avoid any
of the unwholesome qualities listed in the parallel versions. [182] A later part of the Ekottarika-āgama version has a presentation that appears to form a counterpart to this part of
the Sallekha-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel. [183]
As a third aspect, the Sallekha-sutta brings up the simple but effective point that just as
one can avoid an uneven path by taking an even path (or a wrong path by taking a right
path according to the Madhyama-āgama presentation), so too all these unwholesome
qualities can be avoided by cultivating their wholesome counterparts. [184] This principle is
also expounded in the Ekottarika-āgama version. [185]

MN I 44  According to the Majjhima-nikāya account, the fourth aspect to be contemplated in regard to these unwholesome qualities is that unwholesome things lead downward, while

183 [[EA47.9]] at T II 784b29 takes up the case of killing and stealing, recommending to be firm in one’s mind,
without wavering, regarding not engaging in such conduct, followed by turning to the remainder of the
ten unwholesome courses of action. Although this presentation is considerably different from the section
on inclination of the mind in [[MN8]] and [[MA91]] it nevertheless appears to be making the same basic point.

185 [[EA47.9]] at T II 784a19, after which [[EA47.9]] continues directly with the simile about one who is drowning
himself and thus unable to help others cross.


Chapter 1 Mūlapariyāya-vagga                                     -  65


wholesome things lead upward. [186] While the Ekottarika-āgama version does not have a
counterpart to this fourth aspect, the Madhyama-āgama version similarly contrasts dark
things, which have dark results and lead to an evil destination, with bright things, which
have bright results and which lead upward. [187] The Sallekha-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel highlight the benefits that result from avoiding what is unwholesome.
A fifth point, made in all versions, is to extinguish any of these unwholesome qualities
within oneself. This appears to form a warning against premature attempts to set oneself
up as a guide for others. [188] The three versions illustrate the situation of someone, who attempts to discipline another while being himself or herself still undisciplined, with the
example of drowning or sinking in the mud, yet attempting to pull out another who is in
the same predicament. [189]
The five stages of effacement in the Sallekha-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel
thus involve the following main points:

 - refrain even if others indulge,

 - incline the mind to wholesomeness,

 - avoid uneven and wrong through what is even and right,

 - develop what leads upward,

 - extinguish own faults first.
The Sallekha-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel conclude with the Buddha proclaiming that he had done his task as a teacher, exhorting the monks to meditate and not
be negligent. [190]
The Ekottarika-āgama version proceeds differently, as here the Buddha takes up different speculative views, followed by a set of stanzas. [191] The Ekottarika-āgama account concludes with Mahācunda withdrawing into seclusion and eventually becoming an arahant. [192]
While the Sallekha-sutta only notes that Mahācunda rejoiced at the end of the discourse,
the Madhyama-āgama version records that other monks also rejoiced in the Buddha’s exposition.

as a fire cannot be used for putting out another fire, so also a defilement cannot neutralize another defilement”.

death), followed by also mentioning views on the creator of the world.

According to an opinion reported in the Pāli commentary, Mahācunda’s initial question
about views was aimed at some of his disciples, who had been overestimating themselves,
believing that they had already gone beyond such views. [193] Judging from this explanation,
a group of other monks should have been present during this discourse, as recorded explicitly in the Madhyama-āgama discourse’s conclusion.
In fact, the Buddha’s final exhortation to meditate in the Sallekha-sutta is formulated
in the plural, indicating that, although the conclusion only mentions Mahācunda explicitly, the presence of other monks is implicitly covered. [194] The same pattern recurs in other
Pāli discourses, which indicates that, even though a conclusion may mention only the
most prominent person rejoicing, the rejoicing of everyone else present should be understood to be implicit in the same statement.


### [[MN9]] Sammādi��hi-sutta

The Sammādi��hi-sutta, the “discourse on right view”, features an exposition by Sāriputta on right view. This discourse has two Chinese parallels, found in the Madhyamaāgama and in the Sa�yukta-āgama, [195] and a parallel in a Sanskrit fragment. [196]

MN I 46  While the Sammādi��hi-sutta begins with Sāriputta addressing the monks on his own
initiative, the Samyukta-āgama discourse and the Sanskrit fragment version report that


193 Ps I 182,16. This explanation fits well with the way other Pāli discourses present Mahācunda. In [[MN144]]
at MN III 266,4 (= [[SN35.87]] at SN IV 59,7), he gives an instruction to the monk Channa, an instruction
whose wording suggests that Mahācunda thought Channa was overestimating his level of attainment. In
[[AN6.46]] at AN III 355,6, Mahācunda criticizes the conceited attitude of some monks, who because of
their theoretical knowledge or else because of their meditation practice speak disparagingly of other
monks. [[AN10.24]] at AN V 42,3 and [[AN10.85]] at AN V 157,25 report two occasions when Mahācunda
examines the false claims made by monks who overestimate their achievements. These passages thus
present the curbing of conceit and overestimation of other monks as a particular concern of Mahācunda.
194 [[MN8]] at MN I 46,9: jhāyatha, cunda, mā pamādattha, mā pacchā vippa�isārino ahuvattha.
195 The parallels are [[MA29]] at T I 461b-464b, entitled “discourse on Mahāko��hita”,, and [[SA344]] at T II 94b-95b, for which Akanuma 1929/1990: 48 gives the tentative title “Ko��hita”, . A
translation of [[SA344]] is forthcoming in Anālayo 2012f. While [[MN9]] has Jeta’s Grove at Sāvatthī as its
location, [[MA29]] and [[SA344]] take place at Rājagaha. [[SA344]] at T II 94b2 further specifies that, while the
Buddha was in Rājagaha itself, Sāriputta and Mahāko��hita were staying at Mount Vulture Peak near
Rājagaha. This specification explains why the Buddha does not take any part in the present discourse.
Akanuma 1929/1990: 163 lists [[EA49.5]] at T II 797b as another parallel to the Sammādi��hi-sutta. [[EA49.5]] however, reports the Buddha giving a detailed explanation of the twelve links of dependent arising
and correcting Ānanda’s lack of appreciation of its depth. Thus [[EA49.5]] finds a better parallel in [[SN12.2]]
at SN II 2,12, in as much as its exposition of the links of dependent arising is concerned, and has Ānanda’s underestimation of the depth of dependent arising in common with [[DN15]] at DN II 55, 大拘絺羅經 9 and [[SN12.60]] at SN II 92,8. 拘絺羅
196 [[SN474]] folio 16V9 to folio 18V5 in Tripā�hī 1962: 50-54. [[SN474]] folio 16V9 agrees with [[MA29]] and [[SA344]]
on the location of the discourse, while [[SN474]] folio 16V10, similar to [[SA344]] specifies that the two protagonists were staying at Mount Vulture Peak.

Mahāko��hita visited Sāriputta and asked about the implications of right view. [197] According to the Madhyama-āgama discourse, however, it was Sāriputta who had visited Mahāko��hita in order to ask the same question. [198] In each case, the question that led to the delivery of the discourse was about the implications of being endowed with right view and
of having achieved perfect confidence in the teaching, expressions that stand for the attainment of stream-entry. [199]
The first reply to this question, according to all versions, is that to understand wholesomeness and unwholesomeness, together with their respective roots, is to have right
view (see table 1.10). [200] According to the Pāli account, unwholesomeness here stands for
the ten unwholesome courses of action (akusala kammapatha). [201] The Chinese discourses
and the Sanskrit fragment define the same in terms of the three unwholesome actions by
way of body, speech, and mind, thereby differing in letter but not in meaning from the
Pāli presentation. [202] All versions agree that greed, anger, and delusion are the roots of
what is unwholesome, and their absence is the root of what is wholesome.
The Majjhima-nikāya version stands alone in concluding this presentation (and each of
the following expositions of right view) by speaking of abandoning the underlying tendencies to lust, to irritation, and to the conceited view ‘I am’, together with overcoming
ignorance and making an end of dukkha. [203] This statement does not seem to fit its context,
since to overcome ignorance and make an end of dukkha implies full awakening, whereas the question of having right view, found in all versions, is concerned with stream-entry. [204]

197 [[SA344]] at T II 94b4 and [[SN474]] folio 16V10 in Tripā�hī 1962: 50.
198 [[MA29]] at T I 461b25. For a similar reversal of roles between these two monks cf. below p. 268; cf. also
[[AN5.165]] at AN III 192,7, according to which Sāriputta would ask others questions in order to draw out
their knowledge.
199 In the Jain tradition, the conception of right view appears to have a comparable function and related implications, as according to Jaini 1979/1998: 145 the attainment of “samyak-d���i ... heralds ... irreversible
entry onto the path that leads to mok�a”, which will take place (ibid. p. 146) “within no more than four
lifetimes”. Ibid. pp. 148-149 explains that “upon the attainment of samyak-darśana ... the body, the
possessions, even the ever-changing psychological states ... are no longer identified with the self ...
awareness of objects no longer generates a tendency to grasp or manipulate them”. “Gross forms of anger,
pride, deceitfulness and greed ... have been rendered inoperative ... he is invariably ... ‘at peace’ with himself ... he no longer perceives things as ‘attractive’ or ‘desirable’, but rather he penetrates to the fact that
every aspect of life is transitory and mortal”, leading to a “strong disenchantment with worldly things”.
200 [[MA29]] at T I 461c3 differs slightly from the other versions, since it presents knowing the unwholesome
together with its root as one way of having right view, and at T I 461c14 then indicates that knowing the
wholesome together with its root is yet another way of having right view. The parallel versions have both
together as a single way of having right view. In fact, to understand the unwholesome would entail also
understanding what is wholesome, these being but two sides of the same coin, so that such understanding
does not seem to entail two separate ways of having right view.

The Pāli discourse follows this passage on full awakening by declaring that “to that extent” the noble disciple is endowed with right view and has perfect confidence in the
teaching. [205] Yet, such right view and perfect confidence are the hallmarks of stream-entry,
at which stage the underlying tendencies mentioned are not yet abandoned, ignorance has
not yet been fully overcome, and the making an end of dukkha has still to be accomplished. Hence the expression “to that extent” does not seem to tally with the content of
the passage to which it refers. In view of this it appears as if this particular passage, which
is not found in the Chinese and Sanskrit parallels, may be the result of an error in the
transmission of the Pāli discourse.
After the treatment of wholesomeness and unwholesomeness as a way of having right
view, the next alternative way of having right view in the Pāli, Chinese, and Sanskrit versions is insight into nutriment. [206] All versions apply the scheme of the four noble truths


cappasādena samannāgato, and of having “arrived at the true Dharma”, āgato ima� saddhamma�, expressions clearly referring to stream-entry. Ps I 197,24 in fact records a discussion between the rehearsing
monks on whether the attainment of full awakening was already intended by the introductory statement
on the noble disciple being endowed with right view, a discussion which indicates that the commentators
also had difficulties reconciling the present passage with the main theme of the discourse. An extract from
the present discussion already appeared in Anālayo 2005b: 5-6.
205 E.g., [[MN9]] at MN I 47,25: ettāvatā ... ariyasāvako sammādi��hi hoti (Se-MN I 86,20: sammādi��hī), adopting the translation of ettāvatā given in CPD II: 657 s.v. ettāvatā for the present passage.
206 [[MN9]] at MN I 47,33, [[MA29]] at T I 461c24, [[SA344]] at T II 94b27, and [[SN474]] folio 16R9 in Tripā�hī 1962:
51. Norman 1991/1993c: 273 highlights the historical background to the Buddhist use of āhāra, explaining that “in brahminical thought we find the idea that food is required to sustain the existence of the in

Chapter 1 Mūlapariyāya-vagga                                     -  69


to nutriment and to the other items discussed later on, speaking in each case of knowing
the particular item in question, its arising, its cessation, and the noble eightfold path leading to its cessation. [207] In relation to the origin and the cessation of nutriment, all versions
point to craving as the crucial factor.
The Pāli discourse turns to the four noble truths as its next item, [208] while the Chinese
and the Sanskrit versions first take up the three influxes, after which they also turn to the
four noble truths (see above table 1.10). [209] The three influxes occur in the Pāli version
only at the end of the entire exposition. [210] Although there is thus some disagreement in
regard to the placing of the three influxes within the sequence of the overall presentation,
the treatment given to them in the four versions is fairly similar.
A minor difference in relation to the four noble truths is that while the Pāli discourse
lists sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair in its definition of dukkha, [211] the Chinese and Sanskrit versions instead take up being separated from what is liked and associating with what is disliked. [212]
Some Pāli editions of the present discourse agree with the Chinese and Sanskrit versions in mentioning to be separated from what is liked and to associate with what is disliked as instances of dukkha. [213] The same reference recurs in the different Pāli editions of
the Dhammacakkapavattana-sutta, the discourse which, according to the traditional account, constitutes the Buddha’s first exposition of the four noble truths and of the nature
of dukkha. [214]
The Madhyama-āgama version differs from the other three versions in tracing the arising of dukkha to old age and death instead of tracing it to craving. [215] Another difference,


habitants of other worlds or in the next life. The gods need sacrifices as their food, the pit�s need offerings
to continue their existence, and good deeds are seen as a sort of nourishment for the next life”.

which recurs frequently between expositions of the arising of dukkha preserved in Pāli
and Chinese texts, is that the Sa�yukta-āgama version does not specify craving to be of
three types, namely craving for sensual pleasures, for being and for non-being. [216]

MN I 49  The Sa�yukta-āgama version and the Sanskrit fragment have preserved the treatment of
the links intervening between old age and formations only in an abbreviated form, so that
this part of the Sammādi��hi-sutta can only be compared with the Madhyama-āgama
exposition.

MN I 51  A difference between these two versions is that while the Majjhima-nikāya version analyzes craving, feelings, and contact by way of the six sense-doors, [217] the Madhyama-āgama version takes up each of these in a three-fold manner. In relation to craving, the Madhyama-āgama account distinguishes between craving related to sensuality, form, and formlessness. [218] In relation to feelings and contact the Madhyama-āgama discourse differentiates between pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral types. [219]

MN I 53  While the Majjhima-nikāya version defines name (nāma) by listing feeling, perception,
volition, contact, and attention, according to the Madhyama-āgama version name stands
for the four immaterial aggregates. [220] Although the implications of “name” (nāma) under

presents old age and death as what leads to the arising of dukkha: “‘what is reckoned to be the arising of
dukkha?’, the answer is: ‘old age and death are its arising’”, .
216 [[SA344]] at T II 95a5. Choong 2000: 166 notes that the three types of craving are not found in other discourses in the Sa�yukta-āgama, pointing out (note 78) that they do, however, occur in [[EA49.5]] at T II
797c8: . Ibid. also draws attention to another variation found in three parallels to the
Mahānidāna-sutta ([[MA97]] at T I 579b22, T 14 at T I 243a19, and T 52 at T I 845a9), which present craving as twofold: craving for sensual pleasures and for existence, . Such a presentation is also
found in SHT III 822R7-8 (p. 40): dve ānanda t���e, kāmat�[��]ā bhavat���ā ca (which according to SHT
VII p. 268 is a parallel to [[MA97]]). Another parallel to the Mahānidāna-sutta, [[DA13]] at T I 60c13, has the
three types of craving for sensual pleasures, existence, and non-existence; a presentation also found in
other discourses in this collection, cf., e.g., [[DA9]] at T I 50a21, [[DA10]] at T I 53a25, and [[DA11]] at T I 57c15.
The three types of craving are absent from the version of the Buddha’s first discourse in the 何謂苦習, 答曰, 老死為習 Mahāvastu in

in [[EA46.8]] at T II 778c24 and [[EA49.5]] at T II 797b28, however, agrees with [[MN9]] listing
(adopting a and variant that adds to ). Skilling 1993: 158 notes a discourse quotation

Ibid. draws attention to Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya (Abhidh-k-�), which agrees in this respect with [[MA29]] as it defines “name” to stand for the four immaterial aggregates, cf.

went changes during later developments of Buddhist philosophy and came to connote the
entire set of the four mental aggregates, in the Pāli discourses “name” does not explicitly
include the aggregate of consciousness. [221]
The Sammādi��hi-sutta and its parallels continue their exposition similarly by relating
the three types of formation to the arising and cessation of ignorance, the first link of dependent arising. [222] The Pāli version at this point traces the arising of ignorance to the
arising of the influxes, followed by relating the arising of the influxes in turn to the arising of ignorance. [223] As one of the influxes is the influx of ignorance, this reciprocal conditioning of the influxes and ignorance involves some degree of circularity, as in this way
the influx of ignorance becomes responsible for ignorance and ignorance becomes responsible for the influx of ignorance. The implication of this presentation could be to


221 This has been pointed out by, e.g., Harvey 1993: 32, Ñā�amoli 1994: 56, Ñā�avīra 1987/2001: 76, and
Reat 1996: 45; cf. also Del Toso 2007a: 215. This early meaning of “nāma” is still reflected in Vibh 136,8:
vedanākkhandho saññākkhandho sa�khārakkhandho, ida� vuccati nāma�. Even the Visuddhimagga
does not include consciousness under “nāma” in the context of dependent arising, Vism 558,23: nāman ti
... vedanādayo tayo khandhā (cf. also the discussion in Vibh-[[AN169.9]] which explains that only the three
mental aggregates are mentioned in the context of dependent arising because mentioning consciousness as
well would result in the proposition that consciousness conditions consciousness). Only in relation to insight into the nature of mind and matter does the Visuddhimagga employ “nāma” as a covering term for
all four immaterial aggregates, cf. Vism 589,6. Ñā�amoli 1962: 28 note 84/1 draws attention to another
coexistence of different usages of nāma found in the Nettipakara�a, where Nett 15,20 defines nāma to be
phassapañcamakā dhammā, thereby corresponding to the definition given at [[MN9]] but then Nett 78,2
adds citta to these five, thus counting six factors, and Nett 41,16 identifies nāma with the four immaterial
aggregates: nāmakāyo cattāro arūpino khandhā. Windisch 1908: 40 notes that a passage in the Mu��aka
Upani�ad 3.2.8 speaks of rivers losing their nāma-rūpa when flowing into the ocean, aptly illustrating the
sense of nāma as “name”, cf. Radhakrishnan 1953/1992: 691: yathā nadyas syandamānās samudre astam
gacchanti nāma-rūpe vihāya. For a discussion of the pre-Buddhist use of the concept nāma-rūpa cf. also
Hamilton 1996: 121-137, Jurewicz 2000: 89-91, Karunaratne 2003b: 125-126, Oldenberg 1881/1961: 377
(note 21), and Wayman 1982/1984; on nāma alone cf. Werner 1977/1998: 56-57. Regarding the sense
conveyed by the definition of nāma in [[MN9]] at MN I 53,11, Ñā�ananda 2003: 5 provides the illustrative
example of a small child still unable to understand language who, on getting a rubber ball for the first
time, will smell it, feel it, perhaps try to bite it, then roll it around and finally understand that it is a toy.
He explains that “the child has recognised the rubber ball ... by those factors included under ‘name’ in
nāma-rūpa, namely feeling, perception, intention, contact and attention. This shows that the definition of
nāma ... takes us back to the most fundamental notion of ‘name’, to something like its prototype”. Reat
1987: 16-17 sums up that nāma-rūpa, as the “objective counterpart of viññā�a”, stands for “the conceptual and apparitional aspects of any individual object”. Regarding rūpa, de Silva 2004: 56 comments that
“rūpa is a mental image associated with kāya, but at the same time distinct from it”, that is, “rūpa is the
image, like one’s photograph, kāya is the actual physical body”.

highlight the tendency of ignorance to perpetuate itself, [224] in the sense that the influx of
ignorance represents the worldling’s habitual tendency to ignore the true nature of reality,
a habit kept alive by its own effects, ignorant thought and action.
According to the Pāli commentary, the reciprocal conditioning relationship between ignorance and the influxes represents the cyclic nature of sa�sāric existence, where no beginning point can be discerned at which ignorance came into being. [225] The impossibility
of finding such a beginning point is mentioned in several other discourses. [226] One of these
discourses indicates that ignorance is conditionally dependent on the hindrances, a proposition similar in kind to the Sammādi��hi-sutta’s tracing of the arising of ignorance to
the arising of the influxes. [227]
At an earlier point of their exposition, the Chinese and the Sanskrit versions also relate
the arising of the influxes to the arising of ignorance. [228] Neither at that point, nor in the
present passage, however, do they specify a cause for the arising of ignorance.

224 Ñā�avīra 1987/2001: 36 explains that “avijjā ... can have no anterior term that does not itself involve avijjā”; on avijjā in general cf. also Matilal 1980.

pūrvā ko�ir na prajñāyate du�kasya, and in the Divyāvadāna, cf. Cowell 1886: 197,17 or Vaidya 1999:

for ignorance? The five hindrances”, paññāyati idappaccayā avijjā ... ko cāhāro avijjāya? pañca nīvara�ā. [[SN35.79]] at SN IV 50,1 even goes so far as to propose that by eradicating ignorance, ignorance will
be eradicated, avijjā ... eko dhammo yassa pahānā ... avijjā pahīyati (S [e] -SN IV 62,14: pahiyyati); cf. also
the comment in Net 79: avijjā avijjāya hetu, as well as in the ‘Path to Liberation’ (Vimuttimagga/
), T 1648 at T XXXII 450c2: “just ignorance [itself] is the condition for ignorance”,,
a proposal then explained at T XXXII 450c4 by quoting the Buddha’s statement that ignorance arises due
to the arising of the influxes,, which Ehara 1961/1995: 261 note 3 relates to
the present passage in [[MN9]] (on T 1648 cf., e.g., Anālayo 2009s, Bapat 1934, id. 1936, id. 1937b, id.

This absence could be significant, as the
present exposition is only concerned with the right view of stream-entry. Other Pāli discourses use the 解脫道
論 qualification yathābhūta when describing the deeper degree of insight into the influxes that leads to full 唯無明為 無明緣
awakening, cf. [[DN2]] at DN I 84,4, [[DN10]] at DN I 209,12, [[MN4]] at MN I 23,17, [[MN19]] at MN I 117,18,

knowledge that is yathābhūta is certainly also relevant to the attainment of stream-entry (cf., e.g., the exposition of dassana suvisuddha in [[SN35.204]] at SN IV 192,1, which Spk III 55, 如真 8 explains to stand for
stream-entry; or the description of di��hipārisuddhi in [[AN4.194]] at AN II 195,28, a description which [[AN8.17]] at AN II 202,22 employs for the sammādi��hi of an ariyasāvaka), it seems that when this qualifica

The Madhyama-āgama version concludes its series of questions and answers with a final inquiry into what still needs to be done once ignorance has been eradicated, which
meets with the reply that nothing more needs to be done at that point. [229] The Sa�yuktaāgama discourse and the Sanskrit version come to a similar conclusion, reporting that
once Mahāko��hita was told that formations arise due to ignorance, he kept on asking if
there could still be another way of having right view. [230] Sāriputta replied that since at this
point ignorance has vanished and knowledge has arisen, Mahāko��hita was pushing his
line of questioning too far.


### [[MN10]] Satipa��hāna-sutta

The Satipa��hāna-sutta, the “discourse on the establishing of mindfulness”, offers instructions on satipa��hāna. [231] This discourse has a Pāli parallel in the Dīgha-nikāya and
two Chinese parallels, found in the Madhyama-āgama and in the Ekottarika-āgama. [232]
The two Pāli and the two Chinese versions begin by proclaiming that satipa��hāna constitutes the way for the purification of beings and for overcoming grief and sorrow. The
Pāli versions mention “attaining the [true] method” as another benefit of satipa��hāna
practice, while the Madhyama-āgama version speaks of “attaining the right principle”
and the Ekottarika-āgama discourse of “attaining great wisdom”. [233] According to the ex
tion is employed in relation to insight into the influxes its implications are full awakening. From this
viewpoint, then, the absence of the qualification “in accordance with reality” in the present passage in
[[MN9]] would fit the context better than its Chinese and Sanskrit counterparts.

230 [[SA344]] at T II 95b5 and [[SN474]] folio 18V4 in Tripā�hī 1962: 54.
231 The counterpart to the expression satipa��hāna in [[MA98]] at T I 582b11 is (according to Hirakawa
1997: 1032, one of the meanings rendered by is upasthāna), whereas [[EA12.1]] at T II 568a4 speaks of
“settling of the mind”, . Yet another rendering of satipa��hāna can be found in Sa�yukta-āgama discourses, cf., e.g., [[SA614]] at T II 172a18, which employs and thus give a stronger nuance of being
“established in mindfulness”. Regarding the character, as a standard translation of sm�ti in Āgama discourses, Yao 2008: 224 observes that its components and suggest a literal meaning of “present
mind”, thus capturing important nuances of sm�ti in its early Buddhist usage.
232 The Pāli parallel is [[DN22]] at DN II 290-315, while the Chinese parallels are [[MA98]] at T I 582b-584b and
[[EA12.1]] at T II 568a-569b. [[MA98]] agrees with [[MN10]] on the title ( ). [[MA98]] has been translated
by Kuan 2008: 146-154, Minh Chau 1964/1991: 87-95, 199, Nhat Hanh 1990: 151-167, and Saddhāloka

In addition to these, a comparative study of different versions of the four 處 sm�tyupasthānas can be found in Schmithausen 1976; cf. also Sujāto 2005; for translations of the Pāli commentary 意止

Jeta’s Grove by Sāvatthī. Hartmann 1992: 40 notes that in the Hoernle collection an as yet unpublished 今 心

planation given in the Pāli commentary, “method” in the present context represents the
noble eightfold path. [234] From this perspective, the different formulations of this particular
benefit in the Pāli and Chinese versions could be similar in their implications.
The descriptions of the benefits of satipa��hāna practice in the two (Mahā-)Satipa��hāna-suttas and the Ekottarika-āgama version culminate in the realization of Nirvā�a, [235]
while the Madhyama-āgama discourse does not explicitly mention this as a benefit of
satipa��hāna practice. [236] As realization of Nirvā�a features prominently in the concluding
part of the same discourse, this again is a difference that does not seem to imply a real
disagreement.
The Madhyama-āgama version additionally proclaims that all Tathāgatas of past, present, and future times have, do, and will reach awakening by overcoming the five hindrances, practising the four satipa��hānas, and developing the seven factors of awakening. [237] A similar statement can be found in several Pāli discourses. [238] The Ekottarika-āgama version also refers to the need to overcome the five hindrances at this point, without,
however, bringing in the Tathāgatas or the seven factors of awakening. [239]
It is striking that both Chinese versions highlight the need to remove the five hindrances
right at the outset of their exposition, a need also mentioned in the Pāli commentary to
the Satipa��hāna-sutta. [240] Judging from the remainder of the exposition found in the two
(Mahā-)Satipa��hāna-suttas and the Madhyama-āgama version, this need should not be
taken in an absolute sense, as according to these versions a task of mindfulness during
contemplations of dharmas is to be aware of the five hindrances. Since the instructions
given in this respect explicitly speak of being aware of the arising and the presence of
any of these hindrances, it would follow that satipa��hāna can be undertaken when they
are present, so that the reference to their removal does not seem to intend stipulating
their absence as a necessary condition to be fulfilled before being able to embark on satipa��hāna meditation at all. [241]
In fact, according to a discourse in the A�guttara-nikāya the four satipa��hānas should
be developed for the purpose of removing the five hindrances, a statement which would
be meaningless if their removal were required for being able to undertake satipa��hāna

practice. [242] The removal of the five hindrances would, however, constitute a prerequisite
for advanced stages of practice, and thereby for attaining the range of benefits described
in the Pāli and Chinese versions. [243] This would fit with the Chinese versions’ reference to
the need of removing the five hindrances in close proximity to their highlighting of the
benefits of satipa��hāna practice.
The Ekottarika-āgama discourse continues by explaining why satipa��hāna can be
reckoned a “one going way” for the purification of beings and for overcoming grief and
sorrow. According to its explanation, “one” represents mental one-pointedness and “way”
stands for the noble eightfold path. [244] The Ekottarika-āgama version’s explanation thereby highlights that the range of benefits of satipa��hāna, from purification to realization of
Nirvā�a, require satipa��hāna practice to be undertaken as part of an integral practice of
the entire noble eightfold path and in such a way that mental one-pointedness is developed.
Similar to the Ekottarika-āgama version’s reference to the “one going way” of satipa��hāna, the Madhyama-āgama discourse speaks of satipa��hāna as the “one way”, and the
two (Mahā-)Satipa��hāna-suttas use the expression “one going way”. [245]
The Pāli commentary explains the expression “one going way” in five ways, suggesting that it could stand for a single way (in the sense of being straight or direct); a way to
be undertaken alone; a way leading to the one goal of Nirvā�a; a way taught by the “One”
(the Buddha); and a way found only in Buddhism. [246] The same Pāli expression recurs in
another discourse, which describes a man walking along a “one going way” that leads to
a pit, on seeing which one would anticipate him sooner or later to fall into that pit. [247] This
usage suggests straightness of direction as a main implication of this expression, an implication that would correspond to the first of the five commentarial explanations. Hence

translation the Taishō edition attributes to Ān Shìgāo ( )), similarly presents the five hindrances as
what obstructs true vision (with the difference that the fourth hindrance in its listing speaks of the five

[types of] delight,, instead of restlessness-and-worry).

[[EA12.1]] is the first discourse in a chapter entitled “one going way”,, a title that differs in letter but is equivalent in meaning to . By using the expression “one going way” as the chapter heading, the Ekottarika-āgama
appears to give additional emphasis to this qualification of satipa��hāna practice. [[SA535]] at T II 139a20,
[[SA607]] at T II 171a10, and [[SA1189]] at T II 322b1 employ the expression, apparently confounding
ekāyana with ekayāna, cf. also Nattier 2007: 188. A quotation of this introductory proclamation on the 安世高
four satipa��hānas as the `one going way’ for the purification of beings can be found in the *Mahāvibhā�ā, T 1545 at T XXVII 943a 五樂 18: .

76   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


a central import of this Pāli expression would be that satipa��hāna constitutes a “direct”
way to purification and the realization of Nirvā�a. [248]
Instead of referring to the five hindrances or to the noble eightfold path already in their
introduction, the Pāli versions have a passage that recurs elsewhere in the Pāli discourses
as the definition of right mindfulness. [249] This passage relates mindfulness to being diligent, clearly comprehending, and free from desires or dejection in regard to the world. [250]
While the Madhyama-āgama discourse does not have such a passage, the Ekottarika-āgama version similarly speaks of discarding evil thoughts and being free from worry and dejection. [251]
The same Ekottarika-āgama version further expands the topic of overcoming worry
and dejection by mentioning that the contemplating monk experiences joy and delight. [252]
Throughout its subsequent exposition, the Ekottarika-āgama discourse keeps coming
back to this presence of joy and delight while undertaking satipa��hāna, indicating that
even practices such as contemplating the anatomical constitution of the body, or the
stages of decay of a corpse, can result in joy and delight. [253]
The stipulation found in the two (Mahā-)Satipa��hāna-suttas on the need to combine
mindfulness with being diligent, with clear comprehension, and with removing desires
and dejection in regard to the world recurs in a discourse in the Dīrgha-āgama, in Sanskrit fragments that treat of the four satipa��hānas, as well as in Sanskrit fragments of the
Mahāparinirvā�a-sūtra. [254] The same can be found, moreover, in the Dharmaskandha

248 An alternative perspective on the term is provided by Kuan 2001: 164, who suggests that the expression
“ekāyana-magga could imply that the four satipa��hānas constitute the path which is a converging point
for various types of practices”, noting that “this interpretation of ekāyana-magga can also explain why the
Satipa��hāna Sa�yutta ... only contain[s] general guidelines with very limited concrete descriptions of
how to practise. As a guideline, the four satipa��hānas are to be applied to various sets of practices, or
cover these practices”. A related understanding of the term is suggested by Nattier 2007: 199, who identifies ‘point of confluence’ as the earliest meaning of the term in Vedic literature and, based on noting that
expositions of an ekāyana path are usually followed by listing several different items (as in the present
case ‘four’ satipa��hānas), suggests that “the fundamental meaning of the term is the conjunction of originally separate elements”. Hence “the best translation of ekāyano maggo might be ‘unified’ or ‘integrated’
path”, standing for “a path consisting of a combination of practices”.

and in the Śāriputrābhidharma, [255] in the Śrāvakabhūmi, [256] as well as in such works as the
Arthaviniścaya-sūtra, the Daśabhūmika-sūtra, the Pañcavi�śatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā, and the Śatasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā. [257]
These passages combine this stipulation with the need to contemplate body, feelings,
mind, and dharmas internally, externally, and internally-and-externally. The need to undertake contemplation internally, externally, and internally-and-externally is also taken
into account in the two (Mahā-)Satipa��hāna-suttas and in their parallels in the Madhyama-āgama and Ekottarika-āgama. [258] According to the explanation offered in another Pāli
discourse, to undertake internal and external contemplation refers to developing mindfulness not only towards oneself (internally), but also towards others (externally). [259]


ment [[SN360]] folio 167R2-3 and folio 173V2-3 in Waldschmidt 1950: 15 and 18, combine the same stipulation with the instruction to contemplate internally, externally and internally-and-externally, as does [[DA4]]
thereby closely agreeing with the Pāli instructions. The corresponding passage in the Mahāparinirvā�asūtra version that can be found in the Chinese translation of the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, T 1451 at T
XXIV 387b24, also speaks of contemplating internally, externally and internally-and-externally in order
to “subdue desire and aversion, as well as dejection and vexation”, .
255 The corresponding passage in the Dharmaskandha, T 1537 at T XXVI 475c28, reads “endowed with right
energy, right comprehension, and right mindfulness, discarding worldly desire and dejection”,
. The Śāriputrābhidharma, T 1548 at T XXVIII 613a11, reads “with effort and energy, conjoined with clear comprehension and mindfulness, discarding worldly desire and dejection”,
.
256 The Śrāvakabhūmi in Shukla 1973: 299,18 or ŚSG 2007: 188,8 and T 1579 at T XXX 441a16 gives in fact
a detailed exposition to this topic, examining several possible interpretation of the distinction between
internal, external, and internal-and-external practice.

differs from the other versions in so far as it does not speak of contemplating “internally-and-externally 勤 ”,
in addition to contemplating 精進, 應正智念, 除世間貪憂 “internally” and contemplating “externally”. A discourse quotation with the
instructions on internal and external contemplation can be found in Abhidh-k 6.15 in Pradhan 1967:
342,7, paralleling [[MN10]] at MN I 56,27; cf. also Abhidh-k-� at D (4094) mngon pa, nyu 12b4 or Q (5595)
thu 45b8.
259 [[DN18]] at DN II 216,15 speaks of practising satipa��hāna “externally in relation to the bodies of others ...
the dharmas of others”, bahiddhā parakāye ... bahiddhā paradhammesu, something to be undertaken
based on having at first contemplated internally and thereby developed proficiency in concentration. The
parallel [[DA4]] at T I 36a1 indicates that “having contemplated the body internally, one arouses knowledge
of the bodies of others” (followed by listing feelings, mental states, and dharmas in the same way),
This passage is preceded by distinguishing between internal and external contemplation,
so that its implications would be similar to [[DN18]] Another instance reflecting this understanding occurs
in a recently discovered manuscript in Chinese, possibly containing a text by Ān Shìgāo ( ), which
explicitly speaks of undertaking satipa��hāna contemplation in regard to oneself,, and in regard to
others,, cf. Zacchetti 2003: 255-256 and 271 note 88. [[EA12.1]] at T II 568a11, however, relates the
qualification “oneself” to internal and to external contemplation, reading: and .

parallels is that the Ekottarika-āgama version turns to such internal, external, and internal-and-external contemplation already in its introductory part, thereby treating this
stipulation as one of the essential qualities of satipa��hāna practice, while in the other
three versions the same stipulation forms part of a passage repeated at the end of the individual mindfulness exercises. Although this difference in sequence is of less consequence from a practical viewpoint, it is noteworthy that the Vibha�ga, a work representing early Theravāda Abhidharma thought, also directly combines the need to be diligent,
etc., with the need to practise internally, externally, and internally-and-externally. [260] In
this respect, the presentation in the Vibha�ga is thus closer to the Ekottarika-āgama version than to the Pāli discourses.
The two (Mahā-)Satipa��hāna-suttas conclude each mindfulness exercise with an instruction to contemplate arising, passing away, and arising-and-passing away, followed
by indicating that mindfulness should be established merely for the sake of knowledge
and for furthering the continuity of mindfulness. [261] The same instruction closes by indicating that the meditating monk should dwell independent and without clinging to anything in the world. [262]
The Madhyama-āgama version instead describes how mindfulness is established in its
respective object, followed by mentioning the presence of knowledge, vision, understanding, and realization. [263] The Madhyama-āgama discourse concludes each of its expositions of an entire satipa��hāna by proclaiming that practice undertaken according to the
instructions given, even for a very short period, can be reckoned as proper satipa��hāna.
This proclamation mentions not only monks, but also explicitly refers to nuns as practitioners of proper satipa��hāna. [264]
The absence of an explicit reference to contemplation of impermanence in the Madhyama-āgama version is significant, since according to another Pāli discourse such awareness of arising and passing away marks the difference between a mere establishment of
mindfulness and the full development (bhāvanā) of satipa��hāna. [265]

Frauwallner 1964: 75-79 and id. 1971a: 107-112. Law 1930a: 189 sums up: “the Vibha�ga ... is the first
and the earliest of the Abhidhamma books”.
261 I take the prefix pa�i- in pa�issatimattāya in [[MN10]] at MN I 56,33 in its temporal nuance of “again”, in
the sense of pointing to the absence of lapses in mindfulness and therewith to its continuity.

265 [[SN47.40]] at SN V 183,15. Schmithausen 1976: 256 note 33 draws attention to different forms of the locative used in this part of the satipa��hāna instruction. Thus, e.g., [[MN10]] at MN I 56,30+31+32 (taking mindfulness of breathing as an example) employs kāyasmi� (in the expression samudayadhammānupassī vā
kāyasmi� viharati) instead of kāye used for the same exercise in [[MN10]] at MN I 56,11+28+29+35 (in the
expression kāye kāyānupassī). Ibid. takes this to be an indication that contemplation of arising and pass立念在身 有知有見有明有達

Chapter 1 Mūlapariyāya-vagga                                     -  79


The Ekottarika-āgama version, however, does cover the topic of impermanence by
speaking of the body as being impermanent and subject to breaking up, and by instructing to contemplate arising, passing away, and arising-and-passing away in regard to each
of the other three satipa��hānas. [266]
Similar to the two (Mahā-)Satipa��hāna-suttas, the Ekottarika-āgama discourse also
speaks of attaining knowledge and dwelling independently. Unlike the two (Mahā-)Satipa��hāna-suttas, however, the Ekottarika-āgama version indicates that by dwelling independently the meditator experiences joy and delight, does not allow worldly perceptions
to arise, is free from vacillation, and finally realizes Nirvā�a. [267] This presentation in the
Ekottarika-āgama version parallels several other Pāli passages that relate the absence of
clinging to anything – mentioned in the two (Mahā-)Satipa��hāna-suttas together with
dwelling independently – to the breakthrough to full awakening. [268] In this way, the Ekottarika-āgama version makes explicit what seems to be implicit in the _(_ Mahā _-)_ Satipa��hāna-suttas, namely that the expression “to dwell independently and be free from clinging to anything” points to a level of insight that borders on the decisive breakthrough to
awakening.
The two Pāli versions expound the first satipa��hāna – contemplation of the body – by
describing the practice of:

  - mindfulness of breathing,

  - mindfulness of postures,

  - mindfulness of bodily activities,

  - reviewing the anatomical constitution of the body,

  - reviewing the four elements as constituents of the body,

  - viewing a dead body in nine stages of decay.
The two Chinese versions differ considerably from this pattern and from each other,
since the Madhyama-āgama version has several additional exercises, while the Ekottari

ing away did not form part of the original instruction. An alternative explanation could be that kāyasmi�
is used as a more emphatic locative form when the term stands on its own, whereas kāye is used enclitically when the locative form directly precedes kāyānupassī.
266 [[EA12.1]] at T II 568b25 instructs to contemplate the impermanent nature of the body and at T II 568c13, T
II 569a11, and T II 569b4 directs mindfulness to the impermanent nature of feelings, states of mind, and
dharmas, in each instance speaking of,, and (corresponding to samudayadhamma, vayadhamma, and samudayavayadhamma). The need to contemplate arising, passing away, and arising-andpassing away is also mentioned in the satipa��hāna instructions in the Śāriputrābhidharma, T 1548 at T
XXVIII 614b15.
267 [[EA12.1]] at T II 568c15 (in regard to contemplation of feelings):
. A similar instruction recurs for mind and dharmas in [[EA12.1]] at T II
569a13 and T II 569b7.
268 The expression na (ca) kiñci loke upādiyati occurs in such contexts in [[DN15]] at DN II 68,8, [[MN37]] at

80   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


ka-āgama presents a comparatively short account of body contemplation, covering only
four exercises (see table 1.11).


Table 1.11: Contemplation of the Body in [[MN10]] and its Parallels

Common ground between the Pāli and Chinese versions are the anatomical constitution
of the body, the elements, and a corpse in different stages of decay as objects of contemplation of the body. [269] Mindfulness of breathing, of the postures, and of activities are not
found in the Ekottarika-āgama account. These exercises can be found in the Madhyamaāgama discourse, however, and also in the Śāriputrābhidharma. [270]
Although the Ekottarika-āgama exposition of this first satipa��hāna is rather brief,
other works of the Theravāda tradition present mindfulness of the body in an even briefer
fashion. The Pa�isambhidhāmagga has only the two exercises of contemplating the
body’s anatomy and the four elements, and the Vibha�ga’s exposition of this satipa��hāna mentions only a single exercise, which is contemplation of the body’s anatomical
parts. [271]
Similar to the exposition found in the Pa�isambhidhāmagga, the Dharmaskandha lists
only the anatomical parts and the elements for contemplation of the body. [272]

269 [[DN22]] at DN II 293,10, DN II 294,14, and DN II 295,6, [[MN10]] at MN I 57,13+35 and MN I 58,9, [[MA98]]
at T I 583b5+17+24, and [[EA12.1]] at T II 568a18+24 and T II 568b4. Based on a comparative study of different versions of the first satipa��hāna, Schmithausen 1976: 250 suggests that awareness of the body’s
postures may have been the most original version of mindfulness of the body, since, unlike some of the
other body contemplations listed, its nature corresponds best to the type of mindful observation found in
the other satipa��hānas. Bronkhorst 1985: 311, based on the Vibha�ga’s presentation, takes contemplation
of the anatomical parts to be instead the most ancient form of this satipa��hāna.

271 Pa�is II 232,9 and Vibh 193,17. Notably, this presentation forms part of the Vibha�ga’s suttantabhājaniya,
its “analysis according to the method of the discourses”.
272 T 1537 at T XXVI 476a8+29, a difference being that the Dharmaskandha speaks of six elements, instead
of the four elements found in the Pa�isambhidhāmagga and in the two Satipa��hāna-suttas, a presentation
in accordance with [[MA98]] at T I 583b21, which also has six elements in its respective body contempla

Chapter 1 Mūlapariyāya-vagga                                     -  81


The first exercise taken up in the two (Mahā-)Satipa��hāna-suttas is mindfulness of
breathing, a form of practice found also in the Madhyama-āgama discourse, where, however, it does not stand at the beginning of the list of exercises, but rather comes after
awareness of postures and bodily activities. The Śāriputrābhidharma agrees in this respect with the Madhyama-āgama version, as it also places mindfulness of postures and
activities before mindfulness of breathing. [273]
The instructions for mindfulness of breathing given in the Madhyama-āgama discourse
correspond closely to the Pāli instructions, which speak at first of simply knowing inand out-breath, and then instruct to know if in- and out-breath are long or short, followed
by training in experiencing the whole body and in calming the bodily formations. [274]
A difference in relation to this exercise is that the Madhyama-āgama version does not
have the simile of the turner, found in the two (Mahā-)Satipa��hāna-suttas. Another
difference is that the Madhyama-āgama discourse also does not describe that the practitioner of mindfulness of breathing retires to a secluded spot, where he sits down crosslegged and establishes mindfulness in front. [275]
Regarding the exercise described next in the two (Mahā-)Satipa��hāna-suttas, mindfulness of the four postures, the Madhyama-āgama instructions additionally direct mindfulness to the activities of going to sleep and waking up. [276]


tion. The same can also be found in Sanskrit fragments of a text of uncertain authorship containing meditation instructions, the “Yogalehrbuch”, folio 128R6 in Schlingloff 1964: 86.
273 T 1548 at T XXVIII 613b3; the same is also the case for the Pañcavi�śatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā in
Dutt 1934/2000: 204,8; for a discussion of this sequential difference cf. Anālayo 2003a: 117-120.
274 In regard to the last of these steps, [[MA98]] at T I 582c17 agrees with [[DN22]] and [[MN10]] in instructing to
calm the “bodily formations” when breathing in,, but in regard to breathing out it speaks of
calming the “verbal formations”,, a pattern that can be found also in [[MA81]] at T I 555b14.
This would be an error that occurred during textual transmission, as the pattern of the instructions in all
other cases simply applies to the out-breath what has been done during the in-breath. Minh Chau 1964/
1991: 89 comments that the Pāli version’s reference to bodily activities “offers [the] more correct reading”. Other expositions of these four steps of mindfulness of breathing, found in [[SA803]] at T II 206b1 or
in [[SA810]] at T II 208a27, speak of calming the bodily formations on both occasions, when breathing in
and when breathing out. Although the reference to verbal formations could be understood in line with the
definition given in [[SA568]] at T II 150a24 as representing initial and sustained mental application,
, a reference to these two would not fit the present context too well.
275 [[MN10]] at MN I 56,12: araññagato vā rukkhamūlagato vā suññāgāragato vā nisīdati, palla�ka� ābhu 止身行息入 jitvā uju� kāya� pa�idhāya parimukha� sati� upa��hapetvā 止口行息出, cf. also [[DN22]] at DN II 291,3.
276 [[MA98]] at T I 582b21: . [[MN10]] at MN I 57,1 speaks of directing
mindfulness to the body “in whatever way the body may be disposed”, yathā yathā vā pan’ assa kāyo
pa�ihito hoti, cf. also [[DN22]] at DN II 292,14, an expression that enjoins continuity of awareness in any
posture and thus would implicitly also cover the two additional activities mentioned in [[MA98]] Falling
asleep and waking up recur in [[DN22]] [[MN10]] and [[MA98]] in relation to clear comprehension of activities,
where, however, the task appears to be slightly different, since the additional presence of sampajāna/
requires not only being mindful, but also undertaking these activities in a proper and befitting way. A to 有覺,
有觀, some degree related form of practice among the Jains, quoted in Jaini 1979/1998: 66 note 56 as stemming 名為口行
from Dasaveyāliya 4.7, requires to be aware in any of the four postures and while eating or speaking, ja眠則知眠, 寤則知寤, 眠寤則知眠寤
正知


82   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


In the case of the subsequent exercise, concerned with bodily activities carried out with
clear comprehension, the Madhyama-āgama version has fewer activities than the two
(Mahā-)Satipa��hāna-suttas, since it does not mention such activities as looking ahead
and looking away, eating and drinking, or defecating and urinating. [277] The (Mahā-)Satipa��hāna-suttas and the Madhyama-āgama version agree on mentioning the bodily activities of wearing the robes and carrying the alms bowl, in regard to which the Madhyama-āgama instructions additionally indicate that this should be undertaken “skilfully”
and “with orderly manner and appearance”. [278] This additional qualification fits the commentarial explanation of clear comprehension of bodily activities, an explanation which
highlights the need to be aware of purpose and suitability in regard to wearing one’s
robes and carrying one’s alms bowl. [279] In a similar vein, other Pāli discourses indicate
that a monk or a nun should wear their robes and carry their alms bowl in an agreeable
way. [280]

MN I 57 Having described mindfulness of breathing, postures, and bodily activities, the two
(Mahā-)Satipa��hāna-suttas continue with mindfulness of the anatomical parts, of the
four elements, and of a dead body in various stages of decay. These three exercises are
found in both of their Chinese parallels.
The Pāli and Chinese versions present contemplation of the anatomical parts in similar
ways, [281] qualifying this exercise as a contemplation of impurity (asuci). [282] The Ekottari
ya� care, jaya� ci��he, jayamāse, jaya� sae, jaya� bhu�ja�to bhāsa�to, a form of practice whose purpose is to avoid evil activities.
277 [[MA98]] at T I 582b25. The same activities appear to be also absent from a description of clear comprehension in the Mahāparinirvā�a-sūtra, as fragment [[SN360]] folio 167V6 in Waldschmidt 1950: 15 continues
after sā�ghā�īcīvarapātradhāra�e straightaway with gate sthite ni�a��e śayite (in contrast, [[MN10]] at
MN I 57,7 follows sa�ghā�ipattacīvaradhāra�e with asite pīte khāyite sāyite and uccārapassāvakamme
before turning to gate �hite nisinne sutte). The Chinese Dīrgha-āgama version of the same discourse, [[DA2]] at T I 14a3, does speak of clear comprehension in regard to looking in different directions as well as in
regard to eating and drinking (cf. the translation in Yit 2008: 273 note 17), as does the Śrāvakabhūmi in
Shukla 1973: 11,12 or ŚSG 1998: 20,5 and in T 1579 at T XXX 397b17 (for a detailed exposition of clear
comprehension cf. the same work in Shukla 1973: 111,11 or ŚSG 1998: 172,1 and in T 1579 at T XXX
413c29). The set of activities described in [[DN22]] at DN II 292,25 and [[MN10]] at MN I 57,5 appears to be a
standard pericope for proper conduct in the Pāli discourses. The importance of such proper conduct is
reflected in [[MN67]] at MN I 460,9 and [[AN4.122]] at AN II 123,29, according to which a monk’s unwillingness to submit to instructions on how to undertake these activities can eventually lead him to disrobing. A description of proper conduct in the Jain tradition, cited in Deo 1956: 487, also covers defecating
and urinating.
278 [[MA98]] at T I 582b25.
279 Ps I 253,15: sātthakasampajañña and sappāyasampajañña.
280 [[AN4.103]] at AN II 104,10 and [[AN10.98]] at AN V 201,15, which speak of doing these in a manner that is
“pleasing” or “agreeable”, pāsādika.
281 Unlike [[DN22]] at DN II 293,14 and [[MN10]] at MN I 57,17, [[MA98]] at T I 583b8 and [[EA12.1]] at T II 568a20
explicitly mention the brain,, in their lists of anatomical parts. Vism 240,24 explains that the brain is
not explicitly mentioned in the (Mahā-)Satipa��hāna-suttas since it is implicitly covered by “bone marrow”, a��himiñjā. The brain occurs in a somewhat similar list of bodily parts in [[SNP1.11]] at [[SNP199]] cf. also

ka-āgama version additionally highlights the impossibility of having desire in regard to
this body, doubtlessly as a result of undertaking this exercise. [283]
The two (Mahā-)Satipa��hāna-suttas and the Madhyama-āgama version illustrate this
mindfulness practice with the example of looking at a bag full of grains. [284] Such a “double-mouthed bag” full of grains appears to have been a tool for sowing, with an upper
opening for receiving the seeds and a lower opening as an outlet for the grains when
sowing. [285]
This simile could have suggested itself by analogy with the human body, which similarly has an “upper opening” for receiving food and a “lower opening” as the outlet for
faeces. On this interpretation, the simile of the “double-mouthed bag” would also hint at
the dependence of the body on a regular supply of nourishment, which soon enough will
turn into faeces and urine in need of being discarded again.
The two (Mahā-)Satipa��hāna-suttas and the Ekottarika-āgama version take up contemplation of the body in terms of the four elements of earth, water, fire and wind in
similar ways. [286] The Madhyama-āgama discourse adds the elements space and consciousness to these four, thereby covering six elements. [287] To consider the set of six elements as an object of body contemplation is to some extent unexpected, since in this way
body contemplation also covers the element of consciousness, an element that does not

Hayashima 1958: 370 notes that Sanskrit sources usually enumerated thirty-six parts of the body. Hamilton 1996: 10 concludes that “the fact that the list is manifestly not comprehensive suggests that such descriptions are not intended to be understood as definite lists of what the body is made of; rather they indicate examples”. For various listings of anatomical parts cf. also Dhammajoti 2009: 250-252. A discourse
quotation of the listing of anatomical parts (not necessarily specific to the present instance) can be found
in Abhidh-k 7:27 in Pradhan 1967: 411,5, paralleling [[MN10]] at MN I 57,15, with its Chinese counterparts
in T 1558 at T XXIX 140a14 and T 1559 at T XXIX 291a9, cf. also Abhidh-k-� at D (4094) mngon pa,
nyu 58a4 or Q (5595) thu 100b1. In the Arthaviniścaya-sūtra in Samtani 1971: 41,7, the listing of anatomical parts is part of the definition of right mindfulness, used as an antidote to lust.
282 Greene 2006: 34 notes that this qualification is specific to the satipa��hāna context, not being employed
when the same bodily parts are listed in other discourses for contemplation of the four elements, cf., e.g.,
[[MN28]] at MN I 185,16 and its parallel [[MA30]] at T I 464c7. On the tendency to view the body as impure
among ancient Indian ascetic traditions in general cf. Olivelle 2002: 190. Shulman 2010: 402 comments
that “even if we grant that the body is unclean, we must ask if the consideration of the body as unclean or
impure is rightfully described as an instance of ‘mindfulness’”.

The absence of this simile in [[EA12.1]] has a parallel in [[AN6.29]] at AN III 323,20, where the same exercise also
occurs without simile.

fit too well under the heading of “body”. The same six elements can be found in other
Pāli discourses, although not in the context of body contemplation. [288]
The Pāli versions and their Chinese parallels illustrate mindfulness of the elements
with the image of a butcher who has cut up a cow. [289] The Ekottarika-āgama version provides further information on this simile, as it describes how the butcher distinguishes
between the different parts of the slaughtered cow in terms of “leg”, “heart”, “head”,
etc. [290] This presentation is to some degree similar to a gloss found in the Pāli commentary, which explains that this simile illustrates how the practice of this mindfulness exercise can lead to a change of perception. According to the Pāli commentary, once the cow
has been cut up, the butcher will no longer think in terms of “cow”, but only in terms of
“meat”. [291] Similarly, sustained practice of this particular mindfulness exercise will cause
practitioners to think of their body no longer as “I” or “mine”, but perceive it merely as a
manifestation of the four elements.

MN I 58  The last exercise for contemplation of the body in the two (Mahā-)Satipa��hāna-suttas
takes up a dead body in various stages of decay. In ancient India, dead bodies were apparently at times left out in the open in charnel grounds, where they either decayed or
were devoured by wild animals. [292] Monks or nuns would go to such charnel grounds in
order to develop this particular meditation practice. [293] According to the Sa�ghabheda

found also in the Śik�āsamuccaya in Bendall 1902/1970: 210,4. [[MA98]] at T I 583b20 differs from the
other versions in as much as here the butcher separates the meat into six parts, in accordance with the instruction in [[MA98]] to contemplate six elements instead of the four elements mentioned in the other versions. The six element mode of this simile occurs also in fragment 160V2 of the so-called Yogalehrbuch
in Schlingloff 1964: 165, where it is employed for an actual visualization practice, on the practice of
which cf. also Bretfeld 2003, Kloppenborg 1987: 85, Ruegg 1967: 162, Yamabe 1999a: 37-40, id. 2002:
130, and id. 2006: 327. The Bodhisattvapi�aka provides yet another perspective on this exercise, as it enjoins to use one’s body for the benefit of others just as the four elements are of benefit for sentient beings,
T 310 at T XI 307b29, for a translation of the Tibetan version cf. Pagel 1995: 382. Horner 1945: 451 comments that this simile indicates “the cattle-butcher to have been a well known part of the existing social
fabric, ministering to ... those who had no objection to eating beef”.

vastu of the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, before his awakening the Buddha himself had
been strongly affected on seeing the dead and decaying corpses in such a charnel ground. [294]
The Madhyama-āgama and the Ekottarika-āgama descriptions of this exercise are
fairly similar to the two (Mahā-)Satipa��hāna-suttas, proceeding in several stages from a
recently dead and bloated body, via the body being eaten by various animals, to scattered
bones here and there, finally reduced to dust. [295]
In its treatment of the different stages of a decaying body to be contemplated, the
Madhyama-āgama discourse also instructs to contemplate when a corpse is being cremated. [296] The Ekottarika-āgama version concludes this exercise by describing how the
meditating monk acquires insight into the body’s impermanent and ultimately void nature, which well sums up the gist of this exercise. [297]
In addition to the exercises discussed so far, the Chinese versions describe several
other body contemplations. The Ekottarika-āgama version instructs to contemplate the
different apertures of the body and the impure liquids that flow from them, a contemplation found also in other Pāli discourses. [298]
This exercise is one of only four body contemplations in this version, the other three
being mindfulness of the anatomical parts, of the four elements, and of the decay of a
dead body. Hence the Ekottarika-āgama version’s rather succinct account of this satipa��hāna places a particular emphasis on directing mindfulness to the unattractive nature of
the body, revealed in its anatomical parts, in the liquids it discharges, and in its decomposition at death.


58,9, cf. also [[DN22]] at DN II 295,6, suggests that the actual practice of this meditation involves a form of
recollection or even visualization; cf. also Gethin 2006: 97 and above note 289. Ñā�amoli 1991b: 760
note 27 comments that the different stages of decay of a corpse “are not necessarily intended as contemplations of actual corpses”, but “as mental images to be created”. The formulation in [[MA98]] at T I 583b24:
, and [[EA12.1]] at T II 568b4:, however, reads as if the meditator is actually
contemplating a corpse. According to McMahan 1998: 253, although in early Buddhism in general “vocabulary was rife with visual metaphor, vision in a literal sense and visual imagery were not emphasized”.

up various aspects of the cemetery contemplation as an antidote to lust. T 602 instructs that if one feels attracted by the red lips or dark eyebrows of another person, one should recollect that the blood of a dead
person is just as red and a decomposing corpse will become just as dark, and in case one feels attracted by

The Madhyama-āgama version has a number of additional body contemplations. Among
these one finds that it also lists the physical experience of bliss, etc. due to attaining the
jhānas. [299] That the effect of the four jhānas on the body may indeed be counted as a contemplation of the body finds support in the Kāyagatāsati-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama
parallel, which similarly direct mindfulness to the effect these deep concentration experiences have on the body. [300]
Two other additional contemplations found in the Madhyama-āgama under the heading of mindfulness of the body are countering an unwholesome state of mind with wholesomeness and forcefully controlling the mind. [301] Similar exercises are found in a description of how to deal with unwholesome thoughts given in the Vitakkasa��hāna-sutta and
in its Madhyama-āgama parallel, where they fit the context better. [302]
Other ‘body’ contemplations in the Madhyama-āgama version are skill in the “perception of light” by day and night and to “properly grasp and attend to the sign of [reviewing]
contemplation”. [303] The idea of “contemplation” would not seem to be too far from satipa��hāna practice in general, and “perception of light” (ālokasaññā) occurs in the standard description of overcoming the hindrance of sloth-and-torpor, where such perception
takes place together with mindfulness and clear comprehension. [304] Yet, although some of
these practices do bear a relation to mindfulness, their occurrence in a context concerned
with contemplation of the body is puzzling. Mindfulness of the body constitutes an important foundation for the development of deeper degrees of concentration and thereby
also counters unwholesome states of mind. Nevertheless, exercises concerned with the
same aim do not seem to qualify for being body contemplations if they do not take the
body as their object.

MN I 59  The second satipa��hāna in the Pāli and Chinese versions directs mindfulness to feelings. [305] The four versions agree that such mindfulness covers pleasant, painful, and neutral feelings, three types of feeling that should further be distinguished into worldly and
unworldly occurrences. [306] The Madhyama-āgama version, moreover, differentiates these

ālokasaññā occurs also in [[DN33]] at DN III 223,4 and in [[AN7.47]] at AN II 45,9 as a samādhi bhāvanā, a
form of “concentration development”, and in [[AN6.29]] at AN III 323,14 as an anussati, a “recollection”.

three into bodily and mental types, and into those related to sensuality and not related to
sensuality. [307] While to distinguish feelings into bodily and mental types introduces an
additional perspective on mindfulness of feelings, to speak of feelings related to sensuality or not related to sensuality would be similar in meaning to worldly feelings and unworldly feelings, a category already found in all versions (see table 1.12).

The Ekottarika-āgama instruction lists the same types of feeling as found in the two
(Mahā-)Satipa��hāna-suttas, differing in so far as it additionally directs mindfulness to
the mutually exclusive nature of the three types of feeling, explaining that at the time of
experiencing one of these feelings one will not experience the other two. [308] A similar indication, although not as an instruction for mindfulness contemplation, occurs also in
other Pāli discourses. [309]
The third satipa��hāna - contemplation of states of mind - covers a set of ordinary states
of mind and a set of higher states of mind (see table 1.13). [310] The four versions agree that
this satipa��hāna covers mindfulness of the presence or absence of lust, anger, and delusion, as well as of a state of mind that is qualified as contracted or as distracted. To this
the Madhyama-āgama presentation adds the presence or absence of a defiled state of mind,
while the Ekottarika-āgama discourse additionally speaks of thoughts of craving. [311]

cf. also Pāsādika 1998: 499 note 27. Anderson 1999/2001: 38 renders nirāmisa sukha as “disinterested
happiness”, de Silva 1987c: 20 understands nirāmisa to refer to feelings without “material stimulation”,
and Schlingloff 1962b: 81 speaks of “profane” feelings; for yet another interpretation cf. Hamilton 1996:
43-44. The distinction between sāmisa and nirāmisa types of feeling is absent from the exposition at Pa�is
II 233,15, which only takes up the three basic types of feeling and the six types of feeling that arise at the
six sense-doors.

In relation to the “contracted” or “distracted” state of mind, it is noteworthy that this
pair in the two (Mahā-)Satipa��hāna-suttas does not accord with the pattern found in the
other cases of contemplation of mind, which in every case pairs a negative quality with a
positive quality. [312] In order to conform to this pattern, “contracted” (sa�khitta) could be
interpreted to represent a concentrated state of mind. [313] Such an interpretation could
claim support from the introductory narration to the Jātaka collection, where the corresponding verb sa�khipati describes the Buddha’s practice of mettā, an occurrence that
indeed has the sense of “concentrating”. [314] In the Pāli discourses in general, however, the
term sa�khitta appears to have a predominantly negative sense and usually means “contracted”. [315] In fact, the “concentrated” mind is already taken into account among the remaining mental states mentioned for contemplation in the two (Mahā-)Satipa��hāna-suttas, [316] so that to understand sa�khitta as standing for concentration would to some extent
result in a redundancy.
The Ekottarika-āgama version has as its counterpart to this particular category two
pairs, as it first treats the mind that is “distracted” or “not distracted”, and then the mind


312 [[DN22]] at DN II 299,15 and [[MN10]] at MN I 59,33 list the mind that is sa�khitta or vikkhitta as their fourth
pair of states of mind to be contemplated in this satipa��hāna.
313 PED: 665 s.v. sa�khitta lists “concentrated” as one of several meanings of sa�khitta, and gives [[DN2]] at
DN I 80,5 as a reference for this meaning, a passage which has the same set of mind states as in the present instance, although in a context related to telepathic powers (ibid. points out, however, that Vism
410,13 explains this occurrence of sa�khitta to refer to sloth-and-torpor); cf. also the Śrāvakabhūmi, which
relates the contracted mind to mental tranquillity, Shukla 1973: 297,8 or ŚSG 2007: 184,9 and T 1579 at
T XXX 440c12.
314 Jā I 82,1.
315 Cf., e.g., [[SN51.20]] at SN V 279,25, which uses sa�khitta for a state of mind in which sloth-and-torpor are
present.
316 [[DN22]] at DN II 299,22 and [[MN10]] at MN I 59,34.


Chapter 1 Mūlapariyāya-vagga                                     -  89


that is “scattered” or “not scattered”. [317] This presentation fits the pattern of pairing a
positive with a negative quality, although the two pairs seem to be similar in meaning.
In regard to higher states of mind, the Pāli and Chinese versions agree on listing a mind
that is great, concentrated, and liberated, together with their respective opposites. The
two (Mahā-)Satipa��hāna-suttas speak additionally of a mind that is surpassable or unsurpassable. [318] The Madhyama-āgama discourse has the additional categories of a mind
that is superior or inferior, and a mind that is developed or undeveloped. [319] The Ekottarika-āgama version also mentions a mind that has reached attainment, a mind that has become all pervading, and a mind that has become boundless, together with their respective
counterparts. [320]
In other Pāli discourses, the qualification “unsurpassable” occurs in relation to the
fourth jhāna and in relation to full awakening. [321] Hence the “unsurpassable” state of
mind listed in the two (Mahā-)Satipa��hāna-suttas could be similar in meaning to the “developed” mind mentioned in the Madhyama-āgama, and to the mind that has “reached
attainment” found in the Ekottarika-āgama.
In the two (Mahā-)Satipa��hāna-suttas, the last of the four satipa��hānas, contemplation of dharmas, [322] covers:

  - the hindrances,

  - the aggregates,

  - the sense-spheres,

  - the awakening factors,

  - the four noble truths.
Of these exercises, only the awakening factors are found in both parallel versions of
this satipa��hāna. [323] The hindrances are also taken up in both versions, although in the
Ekottarika-āgama version they are mentioned at the beginning of the discourse and thus
appear to be a condition for satipa��hāna practice in general instead of being associated

and liberated constitute common ground among the different traditions. Cf. also Willemen 1998: 77 for a

with contemplation of dharmas. [324] Contemplation of the sense-spheres occurs only in the
Madhyama-āgama version. [325] Contemplation of the aggregates and contemplation of the
four noble truths are not found in either of the two Chinese parallels (see table 1.14). [326]

In relation to this difference, it is noteworthy that the Vibha�ga, the second book in the
Pāli canonical Abhidharma collection, also has only contemplation of the hindrances and
of the awakening factors in its exposition of contemplation of dharmas. The Vibha�ga
presents this as its exposition following the methodology of the suttas, thereby giving the
impression as if this is the original instruction found in the discourses. [327] On the other
hand, the Śāriputrābhidharma lists the hindrances, the sense-spheres, the awakening factors, and the four noble truths under its exposition of contemplation of dharmas. [328] This

325 [[MA98]] at T I 584a14.
326 According to Bronkhorst 1985: 312, the seven awakening factors may have been the most ancient version
of this satipa��hāna, while Schneider 1980/1992: 82 considers the four noble truths as the original nucleus
of contemplation of dharmas.

328 T 1548 at T XXVIII 616a20, T XXVIII 616a25, T XXVIII 616b3, and T XXVIII 616b8. The presentation
of contemplation of the four noble truths in the Śāriputrābhidharma is similar to the short version of this
contemplation in the PTS and Ceylonese edition of the Satipa��hāna-sutta, [[MN10]] at MN I 62,21 and C [e]  MN I 152,4. The Mahāsatipa��hāna-sutta, [[DN22]] at DN II 304-315, and the Burmese and Siamese editions of the Satipa��hāna-sutta, B [e] -MN I 82,10 and S [e] -MN I 117,5, present the same contemplation in a
more elaborate way, by commenting on each aspect of the first and fourth noble truth in detail and by applying the second and third noble truths to a series of stages of the perceptual process at each sense-door
(notably, B [e] -M I 70,1 gives the discourse’s title as the Mahāsatipa��hāna-sutta, which suggests that the
Majjhima-nikāya version was quite explicitly replaced by its Dīgha-nikāya counterpart). Bapat 1926: 11
considers this part of [[DN22]] to be “an amplified version of an originally small sutta ... explaining, in a
commentarial fashion, the details of the four noble truths”; cf. also Barua 1971/2003: 369. According to
Thomas 1927/2003: 252, during the oral transmission of the early discourses “there would also be the
danger of unwittingly including discourses or commentaries ... which were not an original part of the
collection. An instance occurs in the case of the Satipa��hāna-sutta ... found in the Dīgha (No. 22) and
Majjhima (No. 10), but in the former case a long passage of commentary on the Four Truths has been
incorporated”. Similarly, Winternitz 1920/1968: 51 refers to [[DN22]] as an example for Dīgha-nikāya discourses that give the impression of being enlarged versions of shorter texts through the addition of com

Chapter 1 Mūlapariyāya-vagga                                     -  91


results in an unexpected situation, in that a Theravāda Abhidharma text appears more
closely related to the presentation found in a discourse from the Chinese Āgamas, while
an Abhidharma work from a different Buddhist school is fairly close to the presentation
found in the discourses preserved in the Theravāda tradition.
For the Śāriputrābhidharma to be close to the Pāli version of contemplation of dharmas is less surprising, since this work appears to belong to the Dharmaguptaka tradition, [329]
a tradition whose presentations are often fairly similar to the Theravāda tradition. [330] Other
works differ more decisively from the Pāli presentation of contemplation of dharmas, such
as the Jñānaprasthāna, an Abhidharma work of the Sarvāstivāda tradition, which closely
resembles the account found in the Madhyama-āgama. [331]
What remains a puzzle, however, is that the account of contemplation of dharmas
found in the Pāli Vibha�ga should differ so much from the Pāli discourses. As already
mentioned above, in regard to contemplation of the body the same work also differs from
the two (Mahā-)Satipa��hāna-suttas. When considering these differences, it is noteworthy that the Vibha�ga treats any of its topics consistently by presenting first an examination from the perspective of the discourses, followed by examining the same topic from
the perspective of the Abhidharma. Topics expounded in this way include, among others,
the four noble truths, the four right efforts, the four ways to [psychic] power, the seven
factors of awakening, and the four jhānas. In all these instances, the Vibha�ga’s treatment from the perspective of the discourses, its suttantabhājaniya, corresponds to what
can be found in the Pāli discourses.
Hence the Vibha�ga’s treatment of the four satipa��hānas stands out as an instance
where substantial parts of the exposition found in the discourses are completely absent
from the Vibha�ga’s treatment of the same matter “according to the discourses”. This is
all the more puzzling in the case of clear comprehension in regard to various bodily activities as one of the body contemplations. The two (Mahā-)Satipa��hāna-suttas include
this practice under contemplation of the body, yet it is not found in the Vibha�ga’s exposition of body contemplation according to the methodology of the discourses. Nevertheless, the same exercise is described in the Vibha�ga in the context of its exposition of the
jhānas. [332]


mentarial type of material. Trenckner 1888/1993: 534 notes that the long exposition on the four noble
truths in [[MN10]] was in the Burmese manuscript from the India Office Library that he consulted. Since he
published his edition in 1888, the “interpolation” of this passage, as he calls it, had already taken place by

Once clear comprehension of bodily activities is taken into account even in the context
of preparatory exercises for jhāna attainment, one would certainly expect to find the same
exercise in an exposition of body contemplation “according to the discourses”.
In this context it is noteworthy that the two (Mahā-)Satipa��hāna-suttas and the Madhyama-āgama discourses have Kammāsadhamma in the Kuru country as their venue, [333] a
part of India located on the north-western borders of the region in which the Buddha
lived and taught and thus an area reached by the Buddha’s teachings only at a relatively
late stage of his ministry. [334] In contrast, the locations that were in contact with the Buddha’s teaching from earliest times onwards are associated only with shorter expositions
of satipa��hāna, bare outlines of the four satipa��hānas that do not fill in the details of
how these four satipa��hānas are to be put into practice. [335]
Hence, even from the perspective of the Pāli discourses themselves, the detailed exposition of satipa��hāna given among the Kurus should be considered a comparatively later
development, in contrast to the basic outline of the four satipa��hānas as an earlier teaching, taught regularly by the Buddha wherever he went. [336]


pears to be of a similar opinion, as he comments that the “Vibha�ga makes a bare statement of the four
foundations of mindfulness”. Such an intentional selection would, however, not conform to the general
procedure adopted in the Vibha�ga, so that the briefness of the Vibha�ga’s exposition of contemplation of
the body and of dharmas may not be merely a case of intentional abbreviation.

To consider the detailed exposition on satipa��hāna as a later development of the bare
outline of the four satipa��hānas would also find support in the circumstance that not
only the Pāli and Chinese discourses differ in regard to this detailed exposition, but even
the Pāli discourses and the Pāli Abhidharma.
In evaluating the presentation of the fourth satipa��hāna in the Pāli and Chinese discourse versions, the agreement among the different versions highlights the importance of
overcoming the hindrances and developing the factors of awakening as central topics of
contemplation of dharmas. This importance is further corroborated by the circumstance
that both exercises are mentioned already in the introductory part of the Madhyama-āgama version. [337]
The close relation of the hindrances and the awakening factors to contemplation of
dharmas can also be seen in the Samudaya-sutta and its Chinese parallel, according to
which the arising of attention leads to the arising of dharmas. [338] The Pāli commentary explains that the arising of attention leads to the arising of the awakening factors, while its
absence leads to the arising of the hindrances. [339] This explanation defines “dharmas” in a
context related to attention, a term closely related in meaning to mindfulness, [340] as standing for the hindrances and the awakening factors. This further corroborates that the hindrances and the awakening factors are central instances of contemplation of dharmas.
In fact, overcoming the hindrances, developing the awakening factors, and well-established satipa��hāna are, according to several discourses, indispensable conditions for
awakening. [341] This is the case to such an extent that the discourses reckon these three
practices to be a common feature of the awakening of past, present, and future Buddhas. [342]


be seen as implicit in [[MN12]] at MN I 83,2, according to which the Buddha would have been able to speak
on the topic of satipa��hāna for a hundred years without running out of argument.
337 [[MA98]] at T I 582b12. Thanissaro 1996/1999: 74, based on the presentation in the Vibha�ga and in the
Chinese discourses, concludes that all forms of contemplation of dharmas “appear to be variations on the
abandoning of the hindrances and the development of the factors of awakening”.

passages mention satipa��hāna apart from the hindrances and the awakening factors is noteworthy. If contemplation of the hindrances and of the awakening factors should indeed constitute the ancient core of
contemplation of dharmas, as suggested by the agreement between satipa��hāna expositions found in various traditions, then it might seem unwarranted to mention them separately in a list that includes satipa��hāna. However, perhaps the point of such listings of the indispensable conditions for awakening is to de- 憶念集

94   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


These passages clearly highlight the importance of overcoming the hindrances and of
developing the awakening factors, making them prominent candidates for inclusion in
the original core of contemplation of dharmas.Yet, a firm conclusion regarding the earliest version of contemplation of dharmas is not easily drawn, since other contemplations
could make a similar claim in terms of importance, even though they are not found in all
versions. This would, in fact, seem to be the case for contemplation of the five aggregates. Since this contemplation occurs only in the Pāli discourses and is absent from all
parallel versions, as well as from the Vibha�ga, mindfulness directed to the impermanent
nature of the five aggregates would be an evident choice for exclusion from what should
be considered as the original version of contemplation of dharmas.
Yet, such contemplation of the five aggregates has a rather prominent role in other discourses. These present mindfulness of the impermanent nature of the five aggregates as a
crucially important form of contemplation for reaching liberating insight. [343] This is apparently the case to such an extent that a discourse compares instructions on mindfulness
of the five aggregates and their impermanent nature to a “lion’s roar”. [344]
Moreover, some discourses explicitly relate contemplation of the arising and passing
away of feelings, perceptions, and thoughts – thereby covering some out of the five aggregates – to the development of mindfulness and clear comprehension. [345] The close relationship between these instances and satipa��hāna practice becomes particularly evident
in a discourse in the A�guttara-nikāya, which presents contemplation of the arising and
passing away of feelings, perceptions, and thoughts right after referring to contemplation
of the mind, both found in a list of factors that lead to analytical insight. [346] According to
the Mahāpadāna-sutta and its Chinese and Sanskrit parallels, even the former Buddha
Vipassī reached awakening by mindful contemplation of the five aggregates. [347]

not a comprehensive analysis of what a human being is comprised of ... rather, they are the factors of human experience (or, better, the experiencing factors) that one needs to understand in order to achieve the

Thus contemplation of the five aggregates appears to be recognized in the thought
world of the early discourses as a particularly powerful implementation of satipa��hāna
as the direct path to realization, even though from a comparative perspective it would
appear to be a later addition to the instructions given in the discourses explicitly dedicated to this theme.
Whatever may be the final word on the ‘original’ version of contemplations of dharmas,
the practical instruction for contemplation of the five hindrances in the two (Mahā-)Satipa��hāna-suttas and in the Madhyama-āgama version resemble each other to a great extent. [348 ] The Ekottarika-āgama presentation differs in that it merely lists the five hindrances, [349] which would be due to the fact that in its presentation the hindrances do not come
under contemplation of dharmas, but already occur at the outset of the discourse.
Regarding contemplation of the sense-spheres, the two (Mahā-)Satipa��hāna-suttas instruct that each sense and its respective object should be known, followed by knowing
the fetter that arises in dependence on them. [350] The Madhyama-āgama version does not
direct mindfulness to the senses and their respective objects, but mentions both merely as
conditions for the arising of a fetter. [351] According to the Madhyama-āgama presentation,
the task in this case is thus not to be mindful of the senses or their objects as such, but of
the fetter that may arise at any sense-door. This suggests awareness of the fettering force
of perceptual experience and its relation to the arising of unwholesome mental reactions
and associations to be the central aspect of contemplation of the sense-spheres. The remainder of the instructions for contemplating the six sense-spheres in the Madhyamaāgama version is relatively similar to the two (Mahā-)Satipa��hāna-suttas. [352]
The instructions for mindfulness of the awakening factors in the two Pāli discourses
and their Chinese parallels resemble each other. [353] The Ekottarika-āgama presentation

unarisen fetter arises, 3) how the arisen fetter is abandoned, 4) how the abandoned fetter will not arise
again in the future. [[MA98]] at T I 584a15 presents the same exercise in terms of the meditator knowing: 1)
if a fetter is present, 2) if no fetter is present, 3) if an unarisen fetter arises, 4) if an arisen fetter ceases and
does not arise again. Another difference is that in [[MA98]] mindfulness of the sense-spheres precedes mindfulness of the hindrances, whereas the Pāli presentations follow the reverse sequence.

speaks additionally of developing the awakening factors “depending on contemplation,
dispassion, and cessation, casting off evil things”. [354] This brings to mind a qualification
found frequently in the Pāli discourses, according to which the awakening factors are to
be developed in dependence on seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, culminating in relinquishment. [355]
The Ekottarika-āgama version continues by describing the attainment of the four jhānas, a description that still is part of its version of contemplation of dharmas. Since the
instructions cover contemplation of the arising, passing away, and arising-and-passingaway of the four jhānas, the point made by its presentation could be the presence of clear
awareness when attaining and emerging from a jhāna attainment – something of practical use for attaining mastery of jhānas    - and the development of insight into the impermanent nature of the jhānas. [356]

MN I 62  The two (Mahā-)Satipa��hāna-suttas and the Madhyama-āgama version make a prediction on the time required to reach full awakening or non-return through satipa��hāna
practice. While the two (Mahā-)Satipa��hāna-suttas count down from seven years until
they reach a minimum requirement of seven days of practice for reaching such lofty attainments, [357] the Madhyama-āgama discourse similarly counts down from seven years
until it arrives at the possibility of making progress within a single day. [358]


tion of the instruction on how to contemplate the awakening factors can be found in the *Mahāvibhā�ā, T
1545 at T XXVII 952a1; cf. also the Śrāvakabhūmi, Shukla 1973: 299,6 or ŚSG 2007: 186,16 and T 1579
at T XXX 441a7. This part of [[EA12.1]] appears to have suffered from an error in textual transmission,
since [[EA12.1]] at T II 569a21 mentions the awakening factor of mindfulness twice and does not have the
awakening factor of joy (cf. also the remark in the Ekottarika-āgama edition p. 171 note 10).
Curiously enough, the same pattern recurs in [[EA21.2]] at T II 602c4.
354 [[EA12.1]] at T II 569a22: .
355 Cf., e.g., [[SN46.1]] at SN V 63,19: vivekanissita� virāganissita� nirodhanissita� vossaggapari�āmi�.
356 Similar approaches to the development of insight can be found, e.g., in [[MN52]] at MN I 350,12 or in [[MN64]] at MN I 435,31. The version of contemplation of dharmas found in [[DN22]] at DN II 313,11 also mentions the four jhānas in its detailed exposition of the noble eightfold path, although without introducing
an insight perspective in regard to them. These presentations thus serve as a reminder that the practice of
insight cannot be totally separated from the development of deeper levels of concentration. In fact, according to a stanza found in the different versions of the Dhammapada, the development of jhāna and
wisdom depend on each other, a presentation which makes it only natural to find the 佛光 jhānas considered as
part of satipa��hāna practice, cf. [[DHP|DHP372]] n’ atthi jhāna� apaññassa, paññā n’ atthi ajjhāyato; and its
parallel stanza 58 in the Gāndhārī 依觀, 依無欲, Dharmapada 依滅盡, 捨諸惡法 in Brough 1962/2001: 127, stanza 62 in the Patna Dharmapada in Cone 1989: 119 or in Roth 1980b: 103; cf. also stanza 34:12 in a Chinese Dharmapada collection, T 210 at T IV 572a18 (translated in Dhammajoti 1995: 254). The same recurs also as stanza 32:25 in

## Chapter 2 Sīhanāda-vagga

[[MN11]] Cū�asīhanāda-sutta

The Cū�asīhanāda-sutta, “the lesser discourse on the lion’s roar”, presents insight
into clinging to a self as a unique feature of the Buddha’s teaching. This discourse has
two parallels, found in the Madhyama-āgama and in the Ekottarika-āgama. [1]
The Majjhima-nikāya and the Madhyama-āgama versions begin with the Buddha encouraging his monks to roar the “lion’s roar” that the four grades of [true] recluses can
be found only among them, whereas other teachings are devoid of [true] recluses. [2]
The rationale underlying this lion’s roar becomes clearer on consulting the Mahāparinibbāna-sutta and its Chinese and Sanskrit parallels, according to which the four grades
of [true] recluses can only be found in a teaching that contains the noble eightfold path. [3]
The implication of the reference to “[true] recluses” can be gathered from another Pāli
discourse, according to which the four grades of [true] recluses stand for the four stages
of awakening. [4] Thus this lion’s roar affirms that those who attain any of these stages of
awakening can be found only among those who practice the noble eightfold path.
If, after making such a “lion’s roar”, the monks should be asked by other recluses the
reason for such a proclamation, according to the Majjhima-nikāya and Madhyama-āgama versions, in reply they should point out four qualities as a basis for their lion’s roar:

 - they have confidence in their teacher,

 - they have confidence in his teaching,

 - they live fulfilling the precepts,

 - they are affectionately inclined towards their lay and monastic co-disciples.


1 The parallels are [[MA103]] at T I 590b-591b and [[EA27.2]] at T II 643c-644b. [[MA103]] agrees with [[MN11]]
on the title “discourse on the lion’s roar”,, although it does not specify this discourse to be a
“lesser” one. The *Mahāvibhā�ā, T 1545 at T XXVII 38a20, refers to the present discourse under the
same title . While [[EA27.2]] and [[MN11]] take place at Jeta’s Grove by Sāvatthī, [[MA103]] has
Kammāsadhamma in the Kuru country as its location. [[EA27.2]] has been translated in Anālayo 2009g.

Manné 1996: 32, based on surveying various instances of “lion’s roars” in the Pāli discourses, explains them to be “utterances which the speaker
is willing to defend in public”, in line with “the Vedic tradition of challenges in debate”. Another aspect
is brought out by Brekke 1999b: 450, who explains that “the function of the Buddha in the simile of the
lion is to create fear through his teaching ... and when this fear is effectively translated into religious
motivation one will strive to attain nirvā�a 師子吼經 ”. Similarly Heim 2003: 546 notes that “the Tathāgata
delivering his teaching ... in exactly the same way that a lion’s roar causes brutes of the forest to quake in
fear ... suggests that some fear is valuable, in that it can replace complacency with urgency 師子吼經 ”. On the lion

100 - A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


The Pāli commentary explains this fourfold assertion to be an allusion to the four
limbs of stream-entry. [5] On this commentarial explanation, the basis for the above lion’s
roar would be personal verification through the attainment of stream-entry, whereby it
would become a matter of personal experience that the stages of awakening can be attained through the teaching that one has followed.
After listing these four qualities, according to the Cū�asīhanāda-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama counterpart the Buddha instructed his monks that, should other recluses
claim to be endowed with the same four qualities (in relation to their own teaching), a
set of counter-questions could be posed to them, beginning with the inquiry: ‘is the
final goal a single one or are there several final goals?’ [6]
The Ekottarika-āgama version has a rather different beginning. According to its report, the monks had actually gone to visit other recluses and had been challenged by
them. These other recluses had asked the monks to point out in what respect the Buddha’s teaching differed from their own. [7] Apparently unable to reply, the monks withdrew and reported this challenge to the Buddha, who instructed them how to meet such
queries in the future with a set of counter-questions, beginning with the question if
there is one final goal or if there are several final goals.
The set of questions to be posed to other recluses concerning the nature of the final
goal is fairly similar in the Pāli and Chinese discourses (see table 2.1).

5 Ps II 9,5. The standard description of the four limbs of stream-entry (e.g., [[SN55.1]] at SN V 343,1) lists
full confidence in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sa�gha, together with unblemished moral conduct.
Instead of full confidence in the Sa�gha, [[MN11]] at MN I 64,13 only lists being affectionately inclined towards co-disciples. Ps II 8,35 matches these two by explaining that these co-disciples should be understood to be noble disciples, and therewith members of the Sa�gha of noble ones.
6 [[MN11]] at MN I 64,26: ekā ni��hā udāhu puthū ni��hā ti (Be-MN I 93,9 and Ce-MN I 156,21: puthu)?; [[MA103]] at T I 590c3: ; and [[EA27.2]] at T II 643c21: ?
7 Ps II 4,16 somewhat similarly reports the Buddha being informed by his disciples that other recluses claim
to be of equal worth as the Buddha and his monks, which then prompted him to deliver the present discourse.
為一究竟, 為眾多究竟耶? 為一究竟, 為眾多究竟乎


Chapter 2 Sīhanāda-vagga                                    - 101


A noteworthy difference is that the two Chinese versions do not have a counterpart to
the last question found in the Pāli version, which inquires whether someone who enjoys
conceptual proliferation can reach the goal. [8]
The three versions next take up the two views of existence and non-existence. [9] They
explain that lack of understanding the true nature of these two views will cause one to
be affected by those qualities that the previous series of questions had highlighted as
obstructions to reaching the final goal. [10] The Majjhima-nikāya and the Madhyamaāgama versions also point out that those who adopt one of these two views will be opposed to those who adopt the other view.
The Cū�asīhanāda-sutta and its two parallels next examine the claim made by other
recluses and Brahmins that they also teach the full understanding and abandoning of all
types of clinging (upādāna). [11] Other recluses and Brahmins, they explain, fail to take
into account all four types of clinging, which the three versions list with a slight variation in sequence (see table 2.2).
Of these four, the teachings given by other recluses and Brahmins may cover only
one, two, or at most three types of clinging:

  - clinging to sensuality,

  - clinging to views,

  - clinging to rules. [12]
The Buddha’s teaching, in contrast, also takes clinging to a self into account. [13]
The Majjhima-nikāya and the Madhyama-āgama versions declare that for this reason
confidence in such a teacher and such a teaching, together with practice undertaken according to such a teaching and in harmony with other disciples, is properly directed. [14]


8 [[MN11]] at MN I 65,11: sā ... ni��hā papañcārāmassa papañcaratino?
9 A discourse quotation with the distinction between the two types of views can be found in the *Mahāvibhā�ā, T 1545 at T XXVII 38a20 and again at T XXVII 1002b2.
10 [[MA103]] at T I 591a11 agrees with [[MN11]] at MN I 65,23 on the need to understand the arising, cessation, gratification, danger, and escape in relation to these two views, to which it adds the need to also
understand the “cause”,, of these views. [[EA27.2]] at T II 644a7 differs from [[MN11]] and [[MA103]] in so
far as it presents the aspects to be understood as the “origin and results”,, of these two views.
11 [[MN11]] at MN I 66,4 refers to pariññā in this context, while [[MA103]] at T I 591a20 speaks of “abandoning”,, and [[EA27.2]] at T II 644a17 of “eradicating”, . The Chinese versions thus bring out a sense of
pariññā reflected in the commentarial explanation on the present passage, Ps II 16,10, which associates
pariññā with “full understanding through abandoning”, pahānapariññā. The same sense can also be
seen in [[SN22.23]] at SN III 26,29, which defines pariññā as the destruction of lust, anger, and delusion.
For a detailed examination of pariññā and its Jain counterpart pari��ā cf. Tatia 1983.
12 Regarding the term upādāna, Lovejoy 1898: 129 explains that “upādāna is specifically that result of desire which consists in the habitual identification of one’s will and interests with the skandhas ... the existence of [such] upādāna 因 is what leads directly to the formation of a new combination of skandhas in the
next succeeding birth”. 本末
13 A quotation of this part of the discourse can be found in the *Mahāvibhā�ā, T 1545 at T XXVII 173c3.
Karunadasa 2006: 4 comments that this passage in [[MN11]] (as well as in its parallels) highlights 斷 盡 “the
doctrine of non-self ... [as] the unique discovery of the Buddha and the crucial doctrine that separates his
own teaching from all other religious and philosophical systems”.

102 - A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


Table 2.2: Four Types of Clinging in [[MN11]] and its Parallels [15]








|[[MN11]]|[[MA103]]|[[EA27.2]]|
|---|---|---|
|sensuality (1)<br>views (2)<br>rules and vows (3)<br>doctrine of self (4)|sensuality (→ 1)<br>rules (→ 3)<br>views (→ 2)<br>self (→ 4)|sensuality (→ 1)<br>views (→ 2)<br>rules (→ 3)<br>self (→ 4)|



A minor but noteworthy difference is that while the Pāli version speaks of “clinging
to a doctrine of self”, its Chinese parallels simply refer to “clinging to a self”. [16]
The notion of “clinging to a doctrine of self” results in fact in some degree of difficulty when attempting to correlate the overcoming of the four types of clinging with
the four stages of awakening. Clinging to views, which according to the Dhammasa�ga�ī of the Theravāda Abhidharma stands for clinging to wrong views, [17] would be
overcome with stream-entry. Since with stream-entry the fetters of personality view
and dogmatic adherence to rules and vows are also removed, any clinging to a doctrine
of a self and any clinging to rules and vows will also be left behind at this stage.


14 [[MA103]] at T I 591b16 differs from [[MN11]] at MN I 67,7 in that it has this statement at a later point, after
describing the attainment of full realization.
15 Although at first [[EA27.2]] at T II 644a15 agrees with [[MN11]] at MN I 66,2 on the order of listing the four
types of clinging, at a later point [[EA27.2]] at T II 644b6 exchanges the position of the last two. The different sequence adopted in [[MA103]] at T I 591b13 of listing rules before views is noteworthy, since the
Visuddhimagga explains the order in which the four types of clinging are listed to be the reverse of the
order of their arising during a particular form of existence. According to its explanation, the assumption
of a self arises first and leads to the arising of views (especially of eternalism), which in turn engender
clinging to rules and observances in order to purify this self, followed by clinging to sensuality whenever this self is threatened with destruction, Vism 570,15: pa�hama� attavādupādāna�, tato di��hisīlabbatakāmupādānāni. This explanation fits the sequence found in [[MA103]] but does not fit the sequence
in [[MN11]] The sequence found in [[MA103]] recurs again in [[MA29]] at T I 463a7 and also in the Jñānaprasthāna, T 1543 at T XXVI 777b10. For Buddhaghosa’s comment to fit the order in the Madhyamaāgama and in the Jñānaprasthāna better than the order found in the Pāli tradition might lend support to
a suggestion by Kalupahana 1970: 171 and id. 1992/1994: 208 that Buddhaghosa’s commentaries were
influenced by Sarvāstivāda thought. The sequence adopted in [[MN11]] and [[EA27.2]] recurs also in [[EA49.5]] at T II 797c9 and in the Yogācārabhūmi in Bhattacharya 1957: 169,7 and T 1579 at T XXX 314c19.
Dīrgha-āgama discourses often follow the different order sensuality, self, rules, and views, cf. [[DA9]] at
T I 50c5, [[DA10]] at T I 53b16 (which has a variant reading corresponding to the order in [[MN11]]), and
[[DA11]] at T I 57c25. [[DA13]] at T I 60c9, however, follows the order found in [[MN11]] In the Sa�yuktaāgama, [[SA298]] at T II 85b9 follows the order of [[MN11]] while [[SA490]] at T II 127a11 has the order sensuality, self, views, and rules.
16 [[MN11]] at MN I 66,7: attavādupādāna (Ce-MN I 160,9: attavādūpādāna), [[MA103]] at T I 591a22 and [[EA27.2]] at T II 644a16: . The same difference can also be found in [[MN9]] at MN I 51,2 and its parallel
[[MA29]] at T I 463a7. The corresponding expression ātmopādāna can be found in fragment [[SN474]] folio
12R6 in Tripā�hī 1962: 43 (the fragment apparently reads atmopādāna). Another variation can be found
in the Dharmaskandha, fragment 4737 folio 13v3 in Dietz 1984: 59,20, which in one instance speaks of
ātmavratopādāna instead of ātmavādopādāna.

That is, with stream-entry three of the above four types of clinging would already be
overcome. What still remains would be clinging to sensuality, which will be overcome
with the attainment of non-return. This would leave no more clinging to be eradicated
during further progress from non-return to full awakening, [18] a difficult conclusion since
the Pāli discourses explicitly refer to the type of clinging still present in a non-returner. [19]
Such a problem would not arise with the expression used in the Chinese versions,
since “clinging to a [sense of] self” is a form of clinging that will be completely removed only with full awakening. As the Khemaka-sutta and its Samyukta-āgama parallel clarify, although disciples in higher training know the truth of not-self (and thereby would have gone beyond any “doctrine of self”), they still have a subtle clinging to
a sense of self that will only be overcome with full awakening. [20]
The Cū�asīhanāda-sutta continues by tracing the arising of the four types of clinging
back to ignorance, via the intervening seven links of dependent arising (pa�icca samuppāda). [21] The two Chinese versions do not cover the intervening links of dependent arising. The Madhyama-āgama discourse relates the arising of the four types of clinging
directly to ignorance, [22] while the Ekottarika-āgama discourse just indicates that they
arise due to craving. [23] All versions state that the four types of clinging are overcome
with full awakening.
The Pāli discourse ends at this point, while the two Chinese versions conclude with
the lion’s roar about the four grades of [true] recluses found in this teaching. [24] This
lion’s roar occurs in the Ekottarika-āgama discourse at this point for the first time and
is also worded somewhat differently than in the other two versions. In the Ekottarikaāgama version, the Buddha simply points out that the four grades of [true] recluses
cannot be surpassed by anyone else, [25] without, however, proclaiming that the teachings
of others are devoid of [true] recluses, as he does in the Majjhima-nikāya and Madhyama-āgama versions. [26]

18 Ñā�atiloka 1952/1988: 216 comments that the “traditional fourfold division of clinging is not quite satisfactory. Besides kāmupādāna we should expect either rūpupādāna and arūpupādāna, or simply bhavupādāna. Though the Anāgāmī is entirely free from the traditional 4 kinds of upādāna, he is not freed
from rebirth”.
19 This is reflected in a recurrent passage that distinguishes between the attainment of full awakening and
non-return, where the latter alternative is introduced with the specification that there still is a remainder
of clinging, sati vā upādisese, cf., e.g., [[MN10]] at MN I 62,36.

104 - A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


The Ekottarika-āgama version of the lion’s roar thus appears less belligerent than the
other two versions, in spite of being based on an actual encounter with and a challenge
by other recluses, whereas in the other two versions the adversaries are only imagined. [27]
Moreover, the Ekottarika-āgama’s lion’s roar comes as a natural climax at the end of
the exposition, whereas the other two versions have their lion’s roar right at the beginning, which conveys a more confrontational impression. Due to these particulars and
the fact that the Ekottarika-āgama discourse does not make a disparaging statement
about other teachings, its version of the lion’s roar seems to spring from a less competitive spirit.
This would concord with the way other discourses depict the Buddha, indicating that
his attitude towards other contemporary teachers was not competitive or disputatious. [28]
It would be more in harmony with the stance recommended in the Ara�avibha�ga-sutta and its Chinese parallel, according to which one should teach the Dharma without
disparaging others. [29] To disparage others instead of teaching the Dharma, according to
the two versions of this discourse, occurs when a statement is made in such a way as to
belittle others. Taking a lead from this explanation given in the Ara�avibha�ga-sutta
and its parallel, to proclaim that the four types of [true] recluse can only be found in a
teaching endowed with the noble eightfold path would still fall under “teaching the
Dharma”, but to then declare that all other teachings are devoid of any [true] recluses
seems to be moving towards what the Ara�avibha�ga-sutta’s exposition considers as
“disparagement”. [30]
According to a discourse in the Sa�yutta-nikāya and its parallel in the Sa�yuktaāgama, the Buddha described his own attitude with the words: “I do not dispute with
the world, it is the world that disputes with me”. [31]
The Upāli-sutta and its Chinese parallel, as well as the Sīha-sutta, agree in describing
this non-contentious attitude of the Buddha on the occasion when well-known and influential supporters of the Jains became followers of the Buddha. According to these
discourses, Sīha and Upāli expressed their pleasant surprise when the Buddha, instead


and in [[AN8.35]] at AN II 238,8. While [[AN8.35]] appears to be without a Chinese parallel, one of the
parallels to [[DN16]] T 6 at T I 187c8, does not proclaim that other teachings are devoid of true recluses,
thereby being closer in spirit to the lion’s roar in [[EA27.2]]
27 That is, [[EA27.2]] records a real debate, where, as Manné 1990: 73 points out, “something is always at
stake. Not only must the best question be asked, and the best answer be given, but converts must be won
and lay support must be gained”. In contrast, [[MN139]] and [[MA169]] are only concerned with a hypothetical situation and thus much less in need of the belligerent attitude they display.
28 Wijebandara 1993: 98 notes that a “characteristic of the Buddha’s attitude is its unpolemic nature”.
29 [[MN139]] at MN III 231,27 and [[MA169]] at T I 701c17.
30 As Freiberger 2000b: 5 points out, to declare that the teachings of others are devoid of [true] recluses
implies “that the ideal of ‘what an ascetic ought to be’ is realized only in the Buddhist sa�gha”, which
does seem to spring from a somewhat polemic attitude.
31 [[SN22.94]] at SN III 138,26: nāha� ... lokena vivadāmi, loko ca mayā vivadati (Be-SN II 113,6: va instead
of ca, C [e] -SN III 238,11 and S [e] -SN III 169,8: ca kho bhikkhave), and its parallel [[SA37]] at T II 8b16:

of using their conversion for propaganda purposes, advised them to carefully consider
what they were about to do and even requested them to continue supporting the Jain
monks with alms, as they had done earlier. [32] Such a magnanimous attitude in regard to
other contemporary recluses would fit the way the discourses present a fully awakened
Buddha better than the competitive tone of the lion’s roar the Cū�asīhanāda-sutta and
its Madhyama-āgama parallel attribute to him.


[[MN12]] Mahāsīhanāda-sutta

The Mahāsīhanāda-sutta, the “greater discourse on the lion’s roar”, describes the ten
powers and the four intrepidities of a Tathāgata, followed by an account of the Buddha’s ascetic practices before his awakening. This discourse has a parallel in an individual Chinese translation. [33] In addition, a few parts of a version of this discourse have
been preserved in Sanskrit fragments. [34]
Compared to the type of discourses usually included in the Majjhima-nikāya, the Mahāsīhanāda-sutta is relatively long. Due to its length and its coverage of a variety of
topics whose theme is the greatness of the Buddha, this discourse would have suited
the Dīgha-nikāya better than the Majjhima-nikāya collection.
In view of this it comes as no surprise that the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivādins apparently allocated their version of this discourse to their Dīrgha-āgama collection. [35] This Dīrgha
32 [[AN8.12]] at AN IV 185,9 (= Vin I 236,19) and [[MN56]] at MN I 379,3. According to the Chinese parallel
to [[MN56]] [[MA133]] at T I 630a25, the Buddha even advised Upāli that he should not proclaim his conversion at all, in addition to recommending him to continue supporting the Jain monks.
33 T 757 at T XVII 591c-600a, the, a translation that according to the information given in the
Taishō edition was undertaken by Wéijìng ( ). T 757 and the Sanskrit fragment SHT IV 32 folio 41
R5 agree with the Pāli version on locating the discourse at Vesālī. While according to [[MN12]] the Buddha was staying in a grove to the west of Vesālī, according to the Sanskrit fragment he was staying in
the Kū�āgārasālā “on the shore of the Monkey Pond”, marka�ahradatīre, on which cf. also below p. 223
note 95. The Kū�āgārasālā near Vesālī occurs in several other Pāli discourses (e.g., [[MN105]] at MN II
252,2), which indicate that it was located in the Mahāvana.
34 The fragments are SHT IV 32 folios 41-57 (pp. 134-142), SHT IV 500 folio 5 (pp. 222-223), SHT V
1102 (pp. 96-97, cf. also SHT VII p. 280), fragments 149/68, 149/134, and an unnumbered fragment of
the Hoernle collection, edited as no. 133-135 in Hartmann 1991: 238-242 (no. 133 corresponds to Or.
15009/144 in Kudo 2009: 193-194, no. 134 to Or. 15009/65 in Nagashima 2009: 139). Of these frag- 身毛喜豎經
ments, SHT IV 32 folio 41R5 has preserved the discourse’s location. SHT IV 32 folio 42B 惟淨 5 could be a
parallel to the Buddha’s eighth power, recollection of past lives at MN I 70,19, while SHT IV 500 folio
5V1-4 has parts of the ninth and tenth power found at MN I 70,32 and MN I 71,10. SHT IV 32 folios 4354 parallels parts of the description of the five destinations of beings (gati) at MN I 73-76. SHT V 1102
and Hoernle fragment 149/134 or Or. 15009/144 parallel parts of the Buddha’s account of his ascetic
practices at MN I 77-78, such as being naked and not cleaning himself, etc. Hoernle fragment 149/68 or
Or. 15009/65 parallel the Buddha’s examination of purification theories at MN I 81-82. SHT IV 32 folio
55V1-2 parallels the Buddha explanation that he never lived in the Pure Abodes, found at MN I 82,2; cf.
perhaps also Hoernle fragment 149/68R8 or Or. 15009/65V8. In addition to these, Hartmann 2004b: 126
notes another Sanskrit fragment parallel in the newly discovered Dīrgha-āgama manuscript.

āgama version seems to have had the title “hair-raising” discourse, [36] similar to the individual Chinese translation, which has the title “discourse that raises the bodily hairs
out of joy”. [37]
This title occurs also in the Mahāsīhanāda-sutta itself, which concludes with the Buddha dubbing this discourse his “hair-raising instruction”. [38] The title “hair-raising” recurs again in a Jātaka tale that parallels the beginning part of the present discourse and
in references found in several later Pāli works. [39] These occurrences suggest that the Pāli
version of the present discourse was known for quite some time under this title, instead
of being referred to as the Mahāsīhanāda-sutta. [40]
In fact, title variations occur with considerable frequency not only between Pāli and
Chinese versions of a discourse, [41] but even between Pāli versions of the same discourse
found in different Nikāyas, or between different Pāli editions of the same discourse. [42]


36 Ro(mahar�a�a)-sūtra, reconstructed title (from an uddāna preserved in a Hoernle fragment) in Hartmann 1991: 237, who notes that the same title recurs in a reference to the present discourse in the *Karmavibha�gopadeśa in Lévi 1932a: 158,11: romahar�a�īya sūtra.

editions use Mahāsīhanāda as the title, given at B [e] -MN I 97,14 and S [e] -MN I 137,1.
39 This is the Lomaha�sa-jātaka, Jā 94 at Jā I 389,14. In the Milindapañha, Mil 396,2, Nāgasena quotes
part of the Mahāsīhanāda-sutta, to which he refers as the Lomaha�sanapariyāya. Another reference to
the Lomaha�sanapariyāya occurs in B [e] -Ppk-[[AN104]] Several Pāli works speak of the same discourse as
the Lomaha�sa(na)-sutta: Sv I 179,3, It-a I 109,1, B [e] -Mp-� II 256, B [e] -Sp-� I 334, B [e] -Abhidhān-� 504,
and B [e] -Sīlkkh-abh-� II 74. The Cariyāpi�aka, Cp 35,23, entitles a set of stanzas (359-362) concerned with
the bodhisattva’s ascetic practices as Mahālomaha�sacariyā, the “great hair raising conduct”, cf. also
Charpentier 1910a: 400-403 身毛喜豎經 .
40 Although according to the subcommentary, Be-Ps-� II 40, the title Mahāsīhanāda was accorded to this
discourse at the time of the so-called first council by the reciting elders, the sa�gītikāramahātheras, the
substantial number of references to this discourse under the title Lomaha�sana in later Pāli literature
shows that this alternative title would have been known and in use for a considerable time period after
that.
41 Two examples from the Majjhima-nikāya are the Bahuvedanīya-sutta, [[MN59]] at MN I 396, which recurs under the title Pañcaka�ga-sutta in [[SN36.19]] at SN IV 223, and the Cātumā-sutta, [[MN67]] at MN I
456, which (without its first part) recurs under the title Umibhaya-sutta in [[AN4.122]] at AN II 123.
42 Title variations between different Pāli editions of the same Majjhima-nikāya discourses are the Vatthūpama-sutta, [[MN7]] where B [e] has the title Vattha-sutta; the Ariyapariyesanā-sutta, [[MN26]] where B [e]

This suggests that the title of a discourse was relatively open to change at least during
the early stages of transmission. [43]
The Mahāsīhanāda-sutta and its Chinese counterpart begin with Sāriputta informing
the Buddha that Sunakkhatta, a former monk who had left the Buddhist monastic community, was publicly disparaging the Buddha and his teaching. A difference between
the two versions is that while according to the Pāli account Sunakkhatta proclaimed
that the Buddha’s teaching leads to the destruction of dukkha, [44] according to the Chinese version Sunakkhatta’s proclamation was that the Buddha’s teaching was not capable of leading to the destruction of dukkha. [45] As an attempt at disparaging the Buddha,
the Chinese version seems more to the point. [46] Freedom from dukkha appears to have
been a goal aspired to among other ancient Indian recluses and ascetics in general, [47] so
that to disparage a teacher it would make sense to proclaim that he was not able to lead
his disciples to this goal.
In reply to this challenge, according to both versions the Buddha gave a detailed
description of his qualities and powers, indicating that one who continues to uphold
such slander will end up in hell.


43 Skilling 2009b: 64 comments that “there was no standardization of titles”, noting that, although this
gives the impression “that the titles were devised later”, it also needs to be take into account that “many
titles are shared by Mahāvihāra and Sarvāstivāda collection”, showing that these drew on an already
existing common heritage.
44 [[MN12]] at MN I 68,8: n’ atthi sama�assa gotamassa uttari� manussadhammā ... yassa ca khvāssa atthāya dhammo desito so niyyāti takkarassa sammā dukkhakkhayāyā ti (B [e] -MN I 97,18, C [e] -MN I 165,23,
and S [e] -MN I 137,5: uttari). The first part of this proclamation, according to which the recluse Gotama
has not reached any superhuman state, recurs in a Sanskrit fragment related to the ten powers, SHT I 18
V2-3 (p.11): n-ās[t]i śrama�asya (g)[au](tama)sy-ottara�manu�yadharmmād-iti. On the expression uttarimanussadhamma cf. also Anālayo 2008n.
45 In T 757 at T XVII 591c22, the later part of his proclamation is: “how could [this teaching lead to] release, to the destruction and making an end of dukkha”, ?
46 In [[MN12]] at MN I 69,1, the Buddha humorously points out that this proclamation was praise rather than
slander. The commentary, Ps II 23,7, explains that in his proclamation Sunakkhatta had admitted that
the Buddha’s teaching led to the destruction of dukkha because he was afraid that, if he were to proclaim the opposite, he would provoke contradiction by those in Vesālī who had attained different levels
of awakening through the Buddha’s teaching. This commentarial gloss is not particularly convincing,
since the same inhabitants of Vesālī would quite probably feel similarly inclined to contradict Sunakkhatta’s proclamation that the Buddha had not reached any extraordinary knowledge or vision, etc.
What this gloss does indicate, however, is that as a disparaging remark this statement did not sit well
with the commentators, inducing them to attempt an explanation.
47 [[DN2]] at DN I 54,20 reports the proposal, which it associates with Makkhali Gosāla, that fools and wise 豈能出要盡苦邊際
alike will reach the end of dukkha through a succession of rebirths, bāle ca pa��ite ca sandhāvitvā sa�saritvā dukhass’ anta� karissanti. According to [[MN14]] at MN I 93,6, Niga��ha Nātaputta taught how
an end to dukkha can be reached through asceticism, tapasā ... sabba� dukkha� nijji��a� bhavissati.
The last indication receives confirmation, e.g., in the �hā�a�ga 1.45 in Jambūvijaya 1985: 9,2, according to which one of the epithets to describe Mahāvīra’s liberation is that he had eradicated all dukkha.
Hamilton 1997: 279 remarks that “in the religious milieu in which he lived ... the Buddha was not alone
in such a quest”.

MN I 69  The list of the Buddha’s qualities differs to some extent in the two versions (see table
2.3). Both agree in beginning their respective lists with the qualities mentioned in the
standard formulation for recollecting the Buddha. The Pāli version continues with the
Buddha’s ability to exercise supernormal powers, the divine ear, and the telepathic
ability to read the mind of others. The individual Chinese translation instead lists the
Buddha’s ability to live in seclusion and to develop the four jhānas, the four immaterial attainments, and the attainment of cessation.


Table 2.3: Qualities of the Buddha in [[MN12]] and its Parallel

|[[MN12]]|T 757|

Both discourses then turn to the ten powers of a Tathāgata, which they describe in
similar terms, although differing in the sequence of their presentation (see table 2.4). [48]
The Mahāsīhanāda-sutta explains that these ten powers are the grounds for the Buddha
to roar his lion’s roar in assemblies and set rolling the wheel of Brahmā. [49] The Chinese
version has a similar statement only in regard to the four intrepidities of the Tathāgata,
which both discourses describe next. [50]


48 T 757 at T XVII 593a4 presents the Tathāgata’s knowledge concerning the karmic result of deeds as its
sixth knowledge, whereas in [[MN12]] at MN I 70,4 the same occupies the second position. Another difference is that in T 757 at T XVII 593a16 the divine eye precedes the recollection of past lives, whereas
the usual sequence found in Pāli discourses follows the opposite order (cf. also below p. 243). Similar to
T 757, in T 416 at T XIII 893c2 and in T 220 at T VI 966b17 the divine eye precedes the recollection of
past lives in an enumeration of the ten powers of a Tathāgata. While the Chinese version of the Dharmasa�graha, T 764 at T XVII 661a22, does not mention the divine eye in its presentation of the ten
powers at all, the Sanskrit version in Kasawara 1885/1999: 16 includes all three higher knowledges in
its list, presenting them in the sequence found in [[MN12]] The sequence of the other powers in these
works does not correspond to [[MN12]] or to T 757, or to any of the other parallels discussed below in
note 65. The sequence of the ten powers found in T 757 recurs, however, in the Mahāvastu in Basak
1963a: 189,1 or in Senart 1882a: 159,12, and in Basak 1968/2004: 191,23 or in Senart 1897: 320,13. It is
noteworthy that the Mahāvastu lists the ten powers in the same sequence as T 757. Although this similarity is obviously far from being in any way conclusive, it leaves open the possibility that T 757 could
be related to a Mahāsā�ghika reciter tradition. On the ten powers cf. also Dessein 2009: 27-29.

A difference in regard to the first of these four intrepidities is that while the Pāli version indicates that there is nothing left in regard to which the Buddha still has to
awaken, [51] thereby highlighting the completeness of his attainment of awakening, the
Chinese version goes further and attributes omniscience to the Buddha (see table 2.5). [52]


Table 2.5: Four Intrepidities in [[MN12]] and its Parallel

|[[MN12]]|T 757|

Regarding the third of the Buddha’s four intrepidities in the Pāli version, which is
based on his insight into which states should be reckoned as “obstructive states”, [53] the
Chinese parallel offers additional information as it identifies these obstructive states as
desire and lust. [54] This suggestion squares well with the Alagaddūpama-sutta, where the
same term recurs in a proclamation made by the monk Ari��ha that what the Buddha
considered as ‘obstructive states’ were not really obstructions, a proclamation that thus
stands in direct contrast to this intrepidity of the Buddha. [55] The Alagaddūpama-sutta re
51 According to [[MN12]] at MN I 71,35, nobody could rightly challenge the Buddha in the following terms:
“while you claim to be fully awakened, these things you have not fully awakened to”, sammāsambuddhassa te pa�ijānato ime dhammā anabhisambuddhā ti.
52 According to T 757 at T XVII 593b20 the Buddha “knows everything”,, and there is “nothing he
does not know”, ( is a standard translation of sarvajña, cf., e.g., Hirakawa 1997: 9,
Karashima 2001: 323, or Soothill 1937/2000: 2). The commentary to [[MN12]] Ps II 25,18, also attributes
omniscience to the Buddha; on the attribution of omniscience to the Buddha cf. also below p. 416.
53 [[MN12]] at MN I 72,6: antarāyikā dhammā, on this expression cf. Horner 1942/1983: 21 note 5.

of the Dharma”, .

ports how other monks attempted to dissuade him from his view by bringing forth various similes on the danger of indulging in sensual desires. For them to immediately address the topic of sensual desires indicates that ‘obstructive states’ should indeed be understood to represent indulgence in sensuality.
After describing the four intrepidities of the Tathāgata, the Mahāsīhanāda-sutta and
its Chinese parallel turn to the eight assemblies. Before continuing with the comparative
study of these two discourses, however, I briefly survey other discourses that also mention the ten powers and four intrepidities of a Tathāgata.
In the Pāli discourses, the ten powers of a Tathāgata recur in the Sīhanāda-sutta in the
A�guttara-nikāya, which introduces them by comparing the roar of an actual lion to the
Tathāgata’s “lion’s roar” by teaching the Dharma. [56] The tendency to throw into relief
the Buddha’s lion-like quality becomes even more prominent in a Sanskrit fragment of
the Daśabala-sūtra, which has the drawing of a winged lion after each of the Buddha’s
powers. [57]
The ten powers occur also in a set of short discourses in the Sa�yutta-nikāya, which
describes various qualities the monk Anuruddha had reached through his practice of
satipa��hāna. [58] In addition to this, six out of the ten powers of a Tathāgata recur in another discourse in the A�guttara-nikāya, where they also constitute the reason for the
Buddha’s ability to roar his lion’s roar in assemblies. [59]


56 [[AN10.21]] at AN V 32,18; cf. also [[AN10.22]] at AN V 37,6, where the ten powers similarly form the basis for the Buddha’s lion’s roar.
57 Waldschmidt 1958 table I (between p. 386 and p. 387).
58 [[SN52.15-24]] at SN V 304-306, where these ten powers are preceded by the ability to exercise supernormal powers, the divine ear, and the telepathic ability to read the mind of others, similar to the case of
[[MN12]] Although this set of discourses does not seem to have Chinese counterparts, [[EA46.4]] at T II
777a12 and [[EA50.6]] at T II 812b11 both end with the Buddha encouraging his monks to develop these
ten powers, which suggests that from their perspective these ten powers could indeed be attained by a
disciple. However, according to the Pāli commentary, Spk III 263,8, disciples can develop these ten
powers merely to a partial degree, as only Buddhas are able to fully develop them, sabbākāraparipūrī.
The Kathāvatthu, Kv 228,1, maintains the same position against the Andhakas, whom it quotes as proposing that a disciple is capable of fully developing these ten powers; cf. also the discussion in Dessein
2009. The attribution of the ten powers to Anuruddha stands to some extent in contrast to [[SN37.5-24]] at
SN IV 240-245. This group of discourses reports that Anuruddha, who has seen with his divine eye how
some women were reborn in hell and others in heaven, asks the Buddha to explain the qualities that had
caused the type of rebirth of these women. If Anuruddha was held to be possessed of the ten powers of a
Tathāgata – one of which is comprehensive knowledge of karma and its fruit – there would be no need
for him to be shown as inquiring about this from the Buddha. Yet, the point behind this set of discourses
could also be that Anuruddha is asking for the benefit of others, since proclamations on karma and its
fruit made by a disciple would have been more open to disbelief than if they come from the Buddha, as
can be deduced from the way Mahāmoggallāna is reported to have made proclamations on this theme
according to [[SN19.1-21]] at SN II 254-262. [[EA51.3]] at T II 816c9, however, states that the ten powers
are outside of the domain of disciples, . For a comparison of the ten powers with the
abilities of an arahant cf. de Silva 1987a: 40-42.
59 [[AN6.64]] at AN III 417,17. The six powers mentioned here are knowledge of the possible and the impossible, of the results of karma, of the development of concentration, and the three higher knowledges.

Concerning the contents of the Tathāgata’s lion’s roar, made with the ten powers as
its basis, two discourses found in the Sa�yutta-nikāya, both entitled Dasabala-sutta, offer further information. [60] According to their explanation, the Tathāgata’s lion’s roar is
concerned with the impermanent nature of the five aggregates and with dependent arising (pa�icca samuppāda), two central aspects of the Dharma.
The ten powers of the Tathāgata have also been preserved in several Chinese discourses. A discourse in the Sa�yukta-āgama and an individual translation contrast the
five powers of a disciple in higher training (sekha) with the ten powers of a Tathāgata. [61]
The Sa�yukta-āgama discourse agrees with the Mahāsīhanāda-sutta on the nature of
the ten powers and also presents them as the grounds for the Buddha to roar his lion’s
roar in assemblies and set rolling the wheel of Brahmā. [62] It differs from it in regard to
the sequence of listing the ten powers. [63]
The Sa�yukta-āgama version’s sequence of the ten powers recurs in Sanskrit fragments of the Daśabala-sūtra and in two individual Chinese discourses similarly entitled
“on the ten powers”. [64] The same sequence can also be found in several other works preserved in Chinese and Sanskrit. [65]


Endo 1997/2002: 19-20 holds that “the concept of dasabala (ten powers) attributed to the Buddha is a
later development in the Canon”, a development which “seems to have had an intermediate phase where
only six powers of the Buddha are mentioned”, a phase still reflected in [[AN6.64]] Lateness of the ten
powers is also assumed by Choong 2009b: 50. Another set of five powers of a Tathāgata occurs at [[AN10.9]] at AN III 9,15, which completely differs from the set of ten, since it lists confidence (saddhā),
shame (hiri), fear of wrongdoing (ottappa), energy (viriya), and wisdom (paññā).
60 [[SN12.21-22]] at SN II 27-29.
61 These are [[SA684]] at T II 186c14 (translated in Waldschmidt 1932: 208-224) and T 802 at T XVII
747b8. Both versions identify the five spiritual faculties (indriya) as the five powers of a disciple in
higher training. [[SA701]] at T II 189a8 also presents the ten powers of a Tathāgata as the grounds for the
Buddha to roar his lion’s roar in assemblies and set rolling the wheel of Brahmā. [[SA701]] abbreviates the
description of the ten powers, with only the first and the last spelled out, which correspond to [[SA684]] T
802, and [[MN12]] Five out of the ten powers of a Tathāgata, again as the grounds for the Buddha to roar
his lion’s roar in assemblies and set rolling the wheel of Brahmā, occur as part of a set of altogether six
powers in [[SA686]] at T II 187b28 and in [[SA687]] at T II 187c15.
62 T 802 at T XVII 747c17 differs from the Sa�yutta-nikāya and Sa�yukta-āgama lists in regard to one
power, since instead of knowledge of the way to all destinations it speaks of knowledge of the nature of
the likings and desires of sentient beings,
63 As shown in table 2.4, [[MN12]] lists the possible and impossible (1st), karma (2nd), the way to all destinations (3 [rd] ), the different elements in the world (4 [th] ), the different inclinations of beings (5 [th] ), the faculties
of beings (6 [th] ), the development of concentration (7 [th] ), recollection of past lives (8 [th] ), the divine eye
(9 [th] ), and the destruction of the influxes (10 [th] ). Compared with [[MN12]] [[SA684]] has the sequence 1, 2, 7,
6, 5, 4, 3, 8, 9, and 10, a sequence found also in T 802 (except for the difference that this version has
knowledge of the nature of the desires of being as its seventh knowledge, cf. above note 62).
64 Sanskrit fragments of Daśabala-sūtras have been published in Chung 2009, de La Vallée Poussin 1911:

112 - A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


A discourse in the Ekottarika-āgama takes up both the ten powers and the four intrepidities of the Tathāgata, explaining that endowed with these the Buddha is able to
roar his lion’s roar in assemblies. [66] This discourse differs from the Pāli versions not
only in sequence, but also in regard to the content of two out of the ten powers. The Mahāsīhanāda-sutta and the other versions discussed so far speak of knowledge of the
different inclinations of beings (nānādhimuttikatā) and of the diversity of their faculties
(indriyaparopariyatta). The Ekottarika-āgama version instead has knowledge of the
degree of wisdom of other beings and knowledge of the thoughts in others’ minds. [67]
Its description of such telepathic knowledge lists different states of mind, such as a
mind with lust or without lust, a mind with anger or without, etc. Similar lists of such
different states of mind can be found in the Pāli discourses in the context of satipa��hāna meditation and of telepathic powers. [68] The same telepathic knowledge occurs likewise in the Mahāsīhanāda-sutta, where it, however, precedes the ten knowledges. [69]
Although the presentation of the powers in the Ekottarika-āgama version differs in
wording, it may not be too different from the Pāli version in meaning. According to the
exposition of the ten powers of a Tathāgata given in the Vibha�ga, knowledge of the
different inclination of beings is concerned with their inferior or superior disposition. [70]
The inferior or superior disposition of beings could be taken as an expression of their
respective wisdom, and thereby would not be too different from differing degrees of
wisdom of beings, referred to in the Ekottarika-āgama version. The Vibha�ga explains
the Tathāgata’s knowledge of the diversity of faculties of beings by describing his insight
into their good and bad qualities, and into the presence of mental defilements in their
minds, [71] which may not be too different from the telepathic knowledge of the thoughts
in their minds mentioned in the Ekottarika-āgama list.


T 781 at T XVII 718c18, the former entitled “discourse spoken by the Buddha on the ten powers”,
, and the latter “discourse spoken by the Buddha on the ten powers of a Buddha”, .
The presentation of the ten powers in the Sanskrit Daśottara-sūtra corresponds to the exposition found
in the Daśabala-sūtras, cf. Schlingloff 1962a: 29. The ten powers are, however, absent from the Dasuttara-sutta, [[DN34]] and its Dīrgha-āgama parallel, [[DA10]] occurring only in an individual Chinese translation of a version of this discourse, T 13 at T I 241b9. Skilling 1980: 29 notes that Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya attributes an exposition on the ten powers to a Daśottara-sūtra.
65 The same sequence of the ten powers (i.e. 1, 2, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 8, 9, 10) recurs in a discourse quotation in

Having covered the ten powers of a Tathāgata, this Ekottarika-āgama discourse continues with the four intrepidities, which it presents in similar ways as the Mahāsīhanāda-sutta, although differing in the sequence in which it lists them. [72] The four intrepidities recur, moreover, as a discourse on its own in the A�guttara-nikāya, [73] and in another
Ekottarika-āgama discourse. [74]
Returning to the comparative study of the Mahāsīhanāda-sutta and its Chinese parallel, the two discourses follow their description of the ten powers of the Tathāgata and
his four intrepidities by taking up the eight assemblies. According to the Pāli version,
the Buddha was able to approach any of these eight assemblies without fear due to his
being endowed with the four intrepidities. [75] The Chinese version, which does not relate
the Buddha’s approaching the eight assemblies to his four intrepidities, indicates that
the Buddha would teach the Dharma to the members of an assembly in such a way that
they were unable to know if he was a human or a divine being. [76]
Both versions reckon the Buddha’s visit to the eight assemblies as another example of
his possession of supernormal powers, thereby providing a contrast to Sunakkhatta’s
false accusations.
Next, the Mahāsīhanāda-sutta takes up four ways of being born (yoni), presenting the
Buddha’s knowledge of these as further evidence that he was endowed with supernormal powers. [77] The four ways of being born are not mentioned in its Chinese parallel.


lists among others such defilements as greed (lobha), anger (dosa), delusion (moha), sloth (thīna) and
restlessness (uddhacca), which recur explicitly or implicitly in the standard list of mental states for the
exercise of telepathic powers in the Pāli discourses.
72 While [[EA46.4]] at T II 776c28 has the capability of the Dharma to lead to the destruction of dukkha as its
third intrepidity, [[MN12]] at MN I 72,8 has the same as its last. Conversely, the Buddha’s ability to point
out obstructions, which comes as the third intrepidity in [[MN12]] occurs as fourth in [[EA46.4]] For other
references to the four intrepidities cf. BHSD: 512 s.v. vaiśāradya.
73 [[AN7.10]] at AN II 9,3. Sanskrit fragments that have preserved parts of an exposition of the four intrepidities are SHT IV 623 folio 5 (p. 252), SHT VI 1504 (p. 166), and SHT IX 2323 (p. 173). Only three intrepidities occur in [[AN3.64]] at AN I 186,33, which records how the Buddha confronted the rumours
spread by the ex-monk Sarabha. The intrepidity not mentioned in [[AN3.64]] is the Buddha’s insight into
what are obstructions.
74 [[EA27.6]] at T II 645b28 also presents the four intrepidities as the grounds for the Buddha to roar his
lion’s roar in assemblies and set rolling the wheel of Brahmā. [[EA27.6]] at T II 645c7 differs from the
versions discussed so far in regard to one intrepidity, as it proclaims that the Buddha has already left behind deluding states,, instead of mentioning the Buddha’s insight into what are obstructions.

MN I 74 The two versions also turn to the Buddha’s knowledge of the different destinations of
beings (gati). According to an explanation given in the Vibha�ga, this knowledge is an
exemplification of one of the ten powers of a Tathāgata, namely his knowledge of the
paths to any destination, [78] so that this part of the Mahāsīhanāda-sutta and its Chinese
parallel can be seen as drawing out in more detail an aspect of their previous description of the ten powers.
According to the Mahāsīhanāda-sutta, this type of knowledge comprises knowing the
path that leads to:

      - rebirth in hell,

      - rebirth as an animal,

      - rebirth as a ghost (peta),

      - rebirth as a human,

      - rebirth as a god,

      - Nirvā�a. [79]
The Chinese version mentions the same destinations, in addition to which it also mentions rebirth as a demon, asura (see table 2.6). [80]
According to both versions, the Buddha’s knowledge in regard to these different destinations manifests in his ability to predict that someone who has a certain mental inclination and who adopts a certain type of conduct will probably be reborn in a particular realm, followed by later on witnessing with his divine eye that this has indeed happened.


presentation of four yonis in the Aitareya Upani�ad 3.1.3, which differs in so far as it has birth from a
seed as fourth, instead of spontaneous birth; cf. also Schmithausen 1991: 79-80. The Jain �hā�a�ga
7.543 in Jambūvijaya 1985: 221,19 lists seven yonis; �hā�a�ga 8.595 in Jambūvijaya 1985: 243,6 lists
eight yonis.

e.g., Teiser 2004b.
80 T 757 at T XVII 594b8. [[DN33]] at DN III 264,11 and It 3:5:4 at It 93,1 similarly mention the asuras
among different types of rebirth, cf. also Th 1128 and Thī 475, while [[DN33]] at DN III 234,8 and [[AN9.68]] at AN IV 459,14 cover only the five types of rebirth mentioned in [[MN12]] without taking account
of the asuras. The Kathāvatthu at Kv 360,1 and the *Mahāvibhā�ā in T 1545 at T XXVII 868b2 reject
the inclusion of a sixth type of gati. The commentary on the Kathāvatthu at Kv-[[AN104.2]] identifies those
who assert six gatis to be the Andhakas and the Uttarāpathakas, so that the occurrence of six gatis in T
757 could point to another affinity of this text with the Mahāsā�ghika tradition, cf. also above note 48.
Alternatively, the tendency to add the asuras to various listings could also be a general pattern, cf. Przyluski 1927: 118-119 for another instance; cf. also Bodhi 2005: 435 note 6 on the difficulties involved in
considering the realm of the asuras as a fourth bad destination, and Lamotte 1958/1988: 629-630 and id.
1970/1976: 1956-1957 for a survey of references to five or six gatis. Jaini 1979/1998: 108 note 3 quotes
the Sarvārthasiddhi 265 to the effect that the Jain tradition took account of four gatis: the realms of hellbeings, of animals, of men, and of gods, gatiś caturbhedā, narakagatis tiryaggatir manu�yagatir devagatir iti. On petas cf. also Law 1923/1997.

The two versions illustrate the different destinations with the predicament of a tired
and thirsty man who travels on a hot day. This simile establishes the following correspondences for the various types of rebirth:

  - in hell: falling into a blazing pit,

  - as an animal: falling into a cesspit,

  - as a ghost: trying to rest under a tree with little foliage on a hot day,

  - as a human being: resting under a shady tree with plenty of foliage,

  - in heaven: resting in a beautiful mansion.
The Chinese version also covers rebirth as a demon, which it compares to trying to
rest under a small tree covered with ants. [81] Both versions then compare realization of
Nirvā�a to being able to drink and bathe in a beautiful pond, notably the only case in
which the thirsty and tired man is really able to overcome his plight. [82]
A parallel to the Mahāsīhanāda-sutta’s account of the Buddha’s knowledge of the different destinations, found in a discourse in the Ekottarika-āgama, [83] agrees closely with
the Majjhima-nikāya version and also does not mention the asuras. [84]
After the exposition on the different destinations, the Mahāsīhanāda-sutta continues
with the Buddha’s former practice of four types of asceticism. [85] An account of the Buddha’s former practice of these four types of asceticism likewise appears in the Chinese
parallel, [86] where it forms part of the Buddha’s examination of different theories on purification held by contemporary recluses and Brahmins.
According to both versions, the Buddha had engaged in various austerities in vogue in
ancient India, such as accepting food only under specific circumstances and at specified
intervals, not cleaning the body, living in extreme seclusion, and exposing the body to

himself to the vicissitudes of climate, dwelled in a cemetery, and fed on cow dung. [[EA31.8]] continues
with a description of the Buddha’s austerities and awakening which parallels the account given in [[MN36]] at MN I 242,23.

MN I 77

the vicissitudes of the climate - austerities that recur in other discourses as examples of
futile asceticism. [87]
A solution to the contrast between the criticism of these practices voiced in other discourses and their occurrence in the Mahāsīhanāda-sutta and its parallel in an exposition
of praiseworthy qualities of the Buddha can be found in the Lomaha�sa-jātaka. This
Jātaka tale indicates that the bodhisattva undertook these ascetic practices in a former
life as a naked ascetic, ninety-one aeons ago. [88] In fact, some aspects of the austerities
described in this part of the Mahāsīhanāda-sutta would not fit too well with the narrative of the present lifetime of the Buddha. [89] Thus the Mahāsīhanāda-sutta’s treatment
of these four types of asceticism appears to be part of the Buddha’s account of his experiments with various ways and methods of purification during former lifetimes.
The same theme continues in the Mahāsīhanāda-sutta and its parallel, which mention
several other experiences of the bodhisattva in former lives that had made him realize
the futility of various other approaches to purification. In regard to the theory that purification can be obtained through a particular type of rebirth, for example, both versions
state that he had already experienced all types of rebirth, except rebirth in the Pure
Abodes, for had he been born in this realm, he would not have returned to this world. [90]
Unlike the Mahāsīhanāda-sutta, the account in the Chinese discourse also covers:

  - the Buddha’s present life asceticism,

  - his memory of a former experience of the first jhāna,

  - his decision to give up asceticism and take nourishment, which caused his five
companions to abandon him,

  - his development of the four jhānas and his awakening. [91]

disparagement of the Buddha, so that there can be no doubt that it refers to the same occasion as [[MN12]]
89 Dutoit 1905: 50 notes that the description of the bodhisattva’s solitary dwelling in a forest given in [[MN12]] at MN I 79,1, according to which he would hide as soon as he saw a cowherd or shepherd from afar,
stands in contrast to the traditional account according to which the bodhisattva was in the company of
the five monks during his ascetic practices. Dutoit also points out an inner contradiction, where [[MN12]]
at MN I 78,19 describes the bodhisattva undertaking the practice of bathing in water three times a day,
but then at MN I 78,23 depicts how dust and dirt had accumulated on his body over the years to the extent that is was falling off in pieces. Freiberger 2006: 238 notes another contradiction between the reference to nakedness at MN I 77,28 and the wearing of different types of ascetic garment described at MN I
78,10. All these practices would indeed only fit a description of a whole past life of asceticism, or even
of several lives, where at one stage he might have undertaken the practice of bathing, and at a later stage
completely stopped washing until the dirt fell of his body; or at one stage practiced nakedness and at another stage worn various ascetic garments. This further supports the conclusion that these descriptions
do not refer to the accounts of the period of asceticism undertaken by the bodhisattva in his last lifetime.

This part of the Chinese discourse thus parallels the account of the Buddha’s progress
to awakening given in the Mahāsaccaka-sutta. [92]
The Mahāsīhanāda-sutta continues with the Buddha’s declaration that despite his advanced age he is still in full possession of his wisdom and lucidity, so much so that he
would be able to discuss the four satipa��hānas with four disciples during a period of a
hundred years without running short of explanations. [93] Only parts of this declaration are
found in the Chinese parallel. [94]
The Mahāsīhanāda-sutta and its Chinese parallel conclude by reporting that a monk,
who was fanning the Buddha, [95] proclaimed that on hearing this discourse his hair stood
up, which led the Buddha to baptize this discourse as the “hair-raising” instruction.


[[MN13]] Mahādukkhakkhandha-sutta

The Mahādukkhakkhandha-sutta, the “greater discourse on the aggregate of dukkha”,
expounds the full understanding of:

  - sensual pleasures,

  - material form,

  - feeling.
This discourse has four Chinese parallels, one of which is found in the Madhyamaāgama, another parallel occurs in the Ekottarika-āgama, while the remaining two parallels are individual translations. [96]

93 [[MN12]] at MN I 82,32. Line R6 of an unnumbered Sanskrit fragment from the Hoernle collection, no.
135 in Hartmann 1991: 241, suggests that the Sanskrit version also followed an examination of the different purification theories with the theme of the wisdom of a young man that is lost with old age, paralleling [[MN12]] at MN I 82,22.The Buddha’s ability to deliver teachings on the development of mindfulness for a period of a hundred years to four disciples, whose swiftness of wisdom is comparable to a
skilled archer, can also be found as a discourse on its own in [[SA612]] at T II 171c7, translated in Hurvitz
1978: 220. Another relevant discourse is [[MA163]] at T I 693c7, which also illustrates the inexhaustibility
of the Buddha’s teaching with his ability to explain the Dharma to four disciples continuously for a period of hundred years (except for the time required to nourish, relieve and rest their bodies), although it
does not specify his teaching to be concerned with the four satipa��hānas, cf. also below p. 785.
94 T 757 at T XVII 599c18 agrees with [[MN12]] on reporting that some recluses and Brahmins held the view
that the wisdom of a young man will be lost with old age. T 757 at T XVII 600a7 also speaks of disciples endowed with a long life that put questions to the Buddha. Other parts of this account in T 757, however, differ considerably from [[MN12]] for instance T 757 at T XVII 600a21 does not bring in the topic
of satipa��hāna, but instead reports that the Buddha would teach on pleasure, pain, and neither-pleasurenor-pain.

at T XVII 539b-541a. All of these parallels agree with [[MN13]] on locating the discourse in Jeta’s Grove
near Sāvatthī. [[MA99]] and T 53 agree with [[MN13]] on the title “discourse on the aggregate of dukkha”,
(which T 53 qualifies as a discourse “spoken by the Buddha”, ), although neither of
them specifies this discourse as a “greater” one. [[EA21.9]] may have had the same title, as occurs in

MN I 82


118     - A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


MN I 84 The Majjhima-nikāya discourse, the Ekottarika-āgama version, and one of the individual translations begin with a group of monks who, on their way to town to beg for alms,
have a meeting with some other wanderers. [97] According to the Madhyama-āgama version and the other individual translation, however, these other wanderers had come to
visit the monks. [98]
According to all versions, the monks were confronted with a challenge by these wanderers, being asked to point out the difference between their teaching and the Buddha’s
teaching regarding the full understanding of sensual pleasures, form, and feelings. [99] Apparently unable to reply to this challenge, the monks went to see the Buddha in order to
learn from him how such a question should be answered.

MN I 85 According to the Mahādukkhakkhandha-sutta and its parallels, the Buddha told the
monks that they should reply to such a challenge by querying those other wanderers
about the gratification (assāda), danger (ādīnava), and release (nissara�a) in relation to
sensual pleasures, form, and feelings. [100] Wanderers of other traditions who are faced
with such a question would be unable to reply, since only a Tathāgata or someone who
has learned it from him will be able to satisfactorily expound these three aspects.
The Mahādukkhakkhandha-sutta and its parallels continue by providing the details of
such an exposition, indicating that the gratification of sensual pleasures is the pleasure
derived from the five senses. Regarding the dangers of sensual pleasures, the parallel
versions show some variations (see table 2.7). They agree that the need to toil in order
to obtain wealth should be reckoned as a danger inherent in the quest for sensual pleasures, and that another danger is to be found in the difficulties involved in protecting
such wealth, once it has been acquired.

MN I 86  The Majjhima-nikāya version notes as another danger that, for the sake of gaining sensual pleasures, kings, Brahmins and warriors, as well as family members    - such as mother
and child, brother and sister    - will dispute and quarrel. According to its presentation,
these might go so far as to take up weapons and inflict harm or death on each other. [101]

the relevant section of the summary verse of the Ekottarika-āgama at T II 606c28 (following the
and variant reading instead of ). T 737 has the title “discourse on [how] objects of desire lead to dukkha”, . For a remark on [[MA99]] cf. Minh Chau 1964/1991: 61. [[EA21.9]] has
been translated by Huyen-Vi 2004: 59-63 and 216-221. According to the information given in the Taishō edition, T 53 was translated by an unknown translator, while T 737 should be attributed to Dharmarak�a. For counterparts to [[MN13]] at MN I 85,22-29 in Vyākhyāyukti literature cf. Skilling 2000b: 342.
97 [[MN13]] at MN I 84,4 and [[EA21.9]] at T II 604c11 indicate that the monks had gone to visit those wanderers, a detail not mentioned in T 737 at T XVII 539b15. Hartmann 1992: 41 notes that in the Hoernle
collection a fragment that might be a parallel to [[MN13]] at MN I 83 can be found.
98 [[MA99]] at T I 584c11 and T 53 at T I 846c10.

明, standing these three. 聖 苦陰 苦除
100 T 737 at T XVII 539b 所欲致患經 25 only mentions sensual pleasures at this point, although its later treatment does
cover sensual pleasures, form, and feelings. A reference to the Buddha’s teaching of the three types of
full understanding can also be found in [[AN10.29]] at AN V 65,1, which adds his teaching on fully
understanding Nirvā�a as fourth.

The Ekottarika-āgama discourse does not take up this theme at all, and one of the individual translations only mentions quarrel among family members. [102] The Madhyamaāgama version and the other individual translation present this danger in two consecutive steps. First they describe how members of a family may get into dispute with each
other, then they turn to the arising of quarrelling among kings, Brahmins and warriors.
Only in relation to the second group do these two Chinese versions envisage the possibility that such quarrel could lead to taking up weapons or even to killing. [103]
A presentation similar to the Madhyama-āgama discourse and this individual translation recurs in Sanskrit fragments of the Mahalla-sūtra (a discourse otherwise without a
Pāli counterpart), which offers an examination of the gratification, danger, and release
in relation to sensual pleasures that is similar to the Mahādukkhakkhandha-sutta. In its
examination of the dangers of sensual pleasures, the Mahalla-sūtra only speaks of the
taking up of weapons in relation to quarrels that have arisen among warriors and Brahmins, etc., whereas in relation to family members, it merely envisages verbal dispute. [104]

I 848c18, and T 55 at T I 850a4 also depict family members quarrelling only verbally with each other,
in contrast to kings, etc., who go so far as to inflict physical harm or even kill each other. An example
for killing among family members would be the tale of Prince Ajātasattu, who is reported to have killed
his own father out of desire for the throne, cf. [[DN2]] at DN I 85,16, [[DA27]] at T I 109c9, [[EA43.7]] at T II
764a16, and the Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1978a: 251,22. However, this instance would still be in line
with the depiction in [[MA99]] and T 53, as it also falls under the category of kings killing each other.

120     - A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


The Majjhima-nikāya discourse, the Madhyama-āgama version, and the two individual translations reckon the evils of warfare, the suffering caused by burglary and other
unlawful acts, and the consequent brutal punishments apparently prevalent in ancient
India for such deeds as other dangers of sensual pleasures. [105] The Ekottarika-āgama discourse also takes up the danger of warfare, [106] although it does not describe the danger of
being punished for burglary and similar acts.

MN I 87 The Majjhima-nikāya discourse, the Madhyama-āgama version, and the two individual translations note as another danger that desire for sensual enjoyment often leads to
evil conduct by way of body, speech, and mind.
While the Majjhima-nikāya version and one of the individual translations only draw
attention to the resulting unfavourable rebirth as a future danger, [107] the Madhyama-āgama version and the other individual translation also mention the worry and regret experienced by such an evildoer as a danger visible in the present life. [108] The Ekottarikaāgama account instead completes its exposition of the dangers of sensual pleasures by
highlighting their impermanent nature. [109]
The five versions agree that the eradication of desire is the way to go beyond sensual
pleasures. [110] The Majjhima-nikāya discourse, the Madhyama-āgama version, and one
of the individual translations conclude their exposition of sensual desires by declaring
that only recluses and Brahmins who understand the gratification, danger, and release in
relation to sensual desires will be able to go beyond sensual pleasures and lead others to
achieving the same. [111]

Brahmins, and householders will go so far as to attack each other physically in various ways, whereas
in the case of family members fragment 429r1 only speaks of verbal dispute. The same also holds for a
comparable exposition in the Śrāvakabhūmi, which envisages only verbal dispute among family members, cf. Shukla 1973: 79,6 or ŚSG 1998: 122,5 and T 1579 at T XXX 408c6.
105 For an explanation of what these punishments actually entail cf. Barua 1971/2003: 482-483; cf. also the
translations of extracts from commentarial explanations of these punishments, provided by Woodward
1932/1960: 42-43 in the footnotes to his translation of another occurrence of such descriptions.

108 [[MA99]] at T I 585b29 and T 53 at T I 847b27 compare this regret to the shadow of a great mountain that

[[MA199]] at T I 759b28, where it illustrates the regret experienced by an evil doer. The same image recurs, moreover, in two parallels to [[MN14]] [[MA100]] at T I 587a23 and T 55 at T I 850b12; for another
occurrence cf. [[SA1244]] at T II 341a11 and the Śrāvakabhūmi, Shukla 1973: 80,17 or ŚSG 1998: 124,12

[[EA21.9]] at T II 605b11 has a related statement, although it speaks only of the need to know the danger and the release in regard to sensual desires, thereby not mentioning the need to understand the gratification. T 737 at T XVII 540b3
also indicates that removal of lust is the condition for recluses and Brahmins to reach liberation themselves and liberate others, although the first part of its exposition on gratification and danger, etc.,
seems to have suffered from some textual corruption.

Mahādukkhakkhandha-sutta and its parallels next turn to form, illustrating the gratification of form with the example of a beautiful young girl. The corresponding danger
becomes evident once the same girl grows old, succumbs to disease, and finally passes
away, at which time her formerly so beautiful body will undergo decay and decomposition. [112]
In relation to feelings, the Majjhima-nikāya discourse, the Madhyama-āgama version,
and the two individual translations agree that the gratification of feelings is to be found
in the four jhānas. [113] All versions attribute the danger of feelings to their impermanent
nature and propose detachment as the release in regard to them.
While the other versions conclude with the delighted reaction of the listeners, the
Ekottarika-āgama ends with an exhortation by the Buddha to meditate and not be negligent, lest later one regret it. [114]


[[MN14]] Cū�adukkhakkhandha-sutta

The Cū�adukkhakkhandha-sutta, the “lesser discourse on the aggregate of dukkha”,
examines the nature of sensual pleasures. This discourse has three Chinese parallels,
one of which occurs in the Madhyama-āgama, while the other two are individual translations. [115]


112 [[MN13]] at MN I 88,28, [[MA99]] at T I 585c27, [[EA21.9]] at T II 605c7, T 53 at T I 847c25, and T 737 at T
XVII 540b14; a reference to this mode of exposing the `danger’ can be found in the *Mahāvibhā�ā, T
1545 at T XXVII 117a14.
113 [[MN13]] at MN I 89,32, [[MA99]] at T I 586a18, T 53 at T I 848a17, and T 737 at T XVII 540c15. [[EA21.9]]
at T II 606a23 differs considerably from the other versions, since it expounds the gratification in relation to feeling with the example of the practice of mindfulness of feeling (described in the same way as
the Ekottarika-āgama parallel to [[MN10]] [[EA12.1]] at T II 568b27, describes contemplation of feeling as
a satipa��hāna practice). The subsequent passage on the danger of feeling in [[EA21.9]] at T II 606b8 has
no formal introduction, unlike earlier passages of this type in [[EA21.9]] but instead begins with the conjunction “again”,, the equivalent of puna ca para�, even though it treats a different topic. This
gives the impression that an error in textual transmission may have occurred, all the more probable
since contemplation of feeling does not fit the present context; cf. also Huyen-Vi 2004: 220 note 11.
114 [[EA21.9]] at T II 606b27.
115 The parallels are [[MA100]] at T I 586b-587c, T 54 at T I 848b-849b, and T 55 at T I 849b-851a. According to the information given in the Taishō edition, T 54 was translated by Zhī Qīan ( ) and T 55 by
Făjù ( ) (I am indebted to Jan Nattier for kindly sharing a draft translation of T 54 with me). All
versions agree on locating the discourse in Nigrodha’s Grove at Kapilavatthu. [[MA100]] has the title
“discourse on the aggregate of dukkha”, . T 54 has the title “discourse spoken by the Buddha to
the Sakyan Mahānāma”, (leaving out of count the additionally mentioned, on
which Nattier 2008: 128 comments 復次 “what the characters ... ‘original four sons' (?) are doing
here is not at all clear”, followed by noting that “the title given in the Taishō edition is apparently a
recent development; at any rate, it does not appear in any of the medieval catalogues produced through
the eighth century CE”). T 55 has the title “discourse spoken by the Buddha on cases that cause the aggregate of dukkha”, . For a counterpart to [[MN14]] at MN I 92,26 in Vyākhyāyukti literature cf. Skilling 2000b: 342. A reference to the present discourse in Jā 258 at Jā II 314, 支謙 5 speaks of
the Dukkhakkhandhasuttapariyāya 法炬, noted by von Hinüber 1998: 84.

MN I 91 According to the Cū�adukkhakkhandha-sutta and its Chinese parallels, the Sakyan Mahānāma visited the Buddha and inquired after the reason why greed, anger, and delusion
were still able to overpower him. [116] The Buddha replied by turning to the topic of sensual pleasures. He explained that what caused Mahānāma to get overpowered by unwholesome states was also responsible for the fact that he still lived the life of a householder and indulged in sensual enjoyment.
According to the Cū�adukkhakkhandha-sutta, the Buddha continued by describing his
pre-awakening insight into the trifling enjoyment afforded by sensual pleasures and the
great misery that results from them. [117] Despite this insight, he could go beyond the attraction of sensual pleasures only after attaining a type of happiness that is aloof from
sensuality. The commentary explains that this statement refers to the happiness of jhāna
attainment. [118] A to some degree related statement can be found in the Madhyama-āgama version and in one of the individual translations, occurring, however, only after the
exposition of the various disadvantages caused by sensual pleasures and without being
related to the Buddha’s pre-awakening experiences. [119]

MN I 92 The Pāli and Chinese versions agree in describing the disadvantages of sensual pleasures in terms similar to the analogous exposition found in the Mahādukkhakkhandhasutta and its Chinese parallels.
With this exposition completed, the Cū�adukkhakkhandha-sutta and its parallels turn
to a previous encounter between the Buddha and Jain ascetics engaged in self-mortification. [120] The four versions agree that these Jains explained that their ascetic practices
had the purpose of eradicating the retribution for evil deeds done in the past. The Cū�adukkhakkhandha-sutta reports that the Buddha questioned the Jains whether they knew
about their past deeds to be eradicated and about the successful eradication undertaken
so far, [121] a query found in a more brief manner also in one of the individual translations. [122] According to the Pāli account, the Buddha concluded his examination of the
self-mortification undertaken by the Jains by humorously suggesting that those who
have done evil deeds in the past will, if reborn as a human, go forth as Jain ascetics. [[AN116]] [[MN14]] at MN I 91,13, [[MA100]] at T I 586b9, T 54 at T I 848b12, and T 55 at T I 849c4. Ps II 61,22 explains that at the time of asking this question Mahānāma had already progressed to the level of a oncereturner.

between the Buddha and Jain ascetics, their reasoning on the need to reach freedom from dukkha by
way of self-mortification, and the subsequent comparison between the pleasure experienced by King
Bimbisāra and the Buddha, are also recorded in [[EA41.1]] at T II 744a27. The first part of [[EA41.1]] at T II
744a2, however, parallels [[SN55.21]] at SN V 369, a discourse that records another encounter of the
Buddha with the Sakyan Mahānāma, during which the Buddha assured Mahānāma that he would not
meet an evil rebirth even in the event of a sudden death.

similar suggestion is also found in the Madhyama-āgama version and in one of the individual translations. [123]
The same two Chinese versions agree with the Pāli discourse that the Jains replied by
contrasting the greater pleasure experienced by the king of the country with the lesser
pleasure experienced by the Buddha, thereby apparently emphasizing that indulging in
pleasure will not lead to freedom from dukkha. [124] According to all versions, the Buddha
countered this argument by proclaiming that he was able to remain motionless for a
period of up to seven days, all the while experiencing pure happiness, thereby forcing
the Jains to admit that in respect to dwelling in pleasure the Buddha was superior even
to the king of the country.
The reference to the pleasures that can be experienced by someone gone forth suggests that the point of recounting this former meeting with Jain ascetics to Mahānāma
was to show him that going forth, the step required of Mahānāma if he wanted to progress further, could yield an experience of happiness superior even to that available to
the king of the country.
Looking back on the present and the previous discourse, a further comment on their
respective titles may not be out of place. Both discourses examine the “aggregate of
dukkha”, differing in their title in so far as the present discourse is the cū�a (“lesser”)
version of the two, while the previous discourse is its mahā (“greater”) counterpart.
In as much as their respective length is concerned, both appear to be roughly the same.
The length of their introductory parts is about the same, both share the same long and
detailed exposition on the disadvantages of sensual pleasures, and the exposition on
bodily form and feelings in the “greater” version is approximately of the same length as
the encounter of the Buddha with the Jain ascetics described in its “lesser” counterpart.
Apart from length, the qualifications “greater” and “lesser” could be related to the importance of the respective subject matter, or else one of the two discourses could serve
as an introduction or a supplement to the other. [125] Concerning importance, whereas the
“greater” of the two discourses gives a more detailed exposition on “the aggregate of
dukkha” by examining material form and feeling, in addition to sensual pleasures, the
“lesser” version has an exposition of the futility of self-mortification, a topic that also
pertains to the “aggregate of dukkha”. Hence there would seem to be no self-evident
reason for considering one exposition to be substantially more important than the other
one. Both discourses also stand well on their own, none of them serving as an introduction or supplement to the other.


123 [[MN14]] at MN I 93,34, [[MA100]] at T I 587b25, and T 55 at T I 850c14.
124 Bronkhorst 1993/2000: 27 note 4 points out that the statement attributed to the Jains in [[MN14]] at MN I
94,12 that happiness cannot be reached through happiness (with a similar statement found in [[MA100]] at
T I 587b28) has a counterpart in Sūyaga�[[AN1.3]].4.6 which criticizes the view that pleasure can be gained
through pleasure, cf. Bollée 1988: 19,11, translated ibid. p. 129; cf. also Jacobi 1895/1996: 269 note 4.
125 Horner 1953/1980: 194 suggests three possible reasons for distinguishing between the mahā and the
cū�a version of a discourse: length, importance of the subject treated, or the possibility that the cū�a
version is supplementary or introductory to its mahā counterpart.



MN I 94


124     - A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


Although the textual material is of roughly equal length in the case of both discourses,
once they are recited during actual oral transmission, the part common to both can be
abbreviated in the discourse which is placed second. Thereby the second of the two becomes indeed “lesser” in length, because the entire exposition on the disadvantages of
sensual pleasures can be covered with a simple pe, used in the Pāli textual tradition to
mark abbreviations. Thus the decision to distinguish these two discourses as “lesser”
and “greater” versions, a distinction not found in their Chinese parallels, would probably have been taken only at a time when these two discourses were already part of a formalized set of transmitted material.


[[MN15]] Anumāna-sutta

The Anumāna-sutta, the “discourse on inference”, presents an exposition by Mahāmoggallāna on the unwholesome qualities that will prevent a monk from being admonished and instructed by his fellow monks. This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama and another parallel in an individual translation. [126]

MN I 95 While the Anumāna-sutta begins directly with Mahāmoggallāna addressing the monks,
its two Chinese parallels provide some additional background to Mahāmoggallāna’s exposition, as they indicate that the present discourse took place at the end of the annual
retreat period. According to monastic observances, at the conclusion of this period of
three months the monks will invite each other to point out possible shortcomings at the
pavāra�ā ceremony. [127] Although the Anumāna-sutta does not provide an explicit relation to the annual retreat or the pavāra�ā ceremony, Mahāmoggallāna’s exposition begins by describing how a monk “invites” (pavāreti) other monks to admonish him, [128] a
verb that supports associating this discourse with the monastic observance of “inviting”
(pavāra�ā) critique by other monks.


126 The parallels are [[MA89]] at T I 571c-572c and T 50 at T I 842b-843b. According to the information
given in the Taishō edition, T 50 was translated by Dharmarak�a. [[MA89]] has the title “discourse on a
monk’s invitation”,, while the title of T 50 is, “discourse spoken by the Buddha
at the completion of the rains retreat” (, which besides being part of the title occurs also in T 50 at
T I 842b7, would correspond to in the counterpart passage in [[MA89]] at T I 571c2). The term
vassa or var�a can mean “rain” and also “year”, which may have made the translator use . While [[MN15]] has the Deer Park at Su�sumāragiri in the Bhaggā country as its location, the two Chinese versions
take place at the Squirrels’ Feeding Ground near Rājagaha.
127 The pavāra�ā regulations can be found at Vin I 160,23; for the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda and Sarvāstivāda
versions cf. Chung 1998. An actual instance of such “inviting” is recorded in [[SN8.7]] at SN I 190,30 (or
SN [2] 215 at SN [2] I 410,18), with its counterparts in [[MA121]] at T I 610b3, [[SA1212]] at T II 330a14, SĀ [2]

The point of Mahāmoggallāna’s exposition was that, even when invited, other monks
will hold back with their advice and criticism if a monk exhibits certain unwholesome
qualities, whereby such a monk will miss an important opportunity for improving himself. The listing of these unwholesome qualities shows some variations in the three versions (see table 2.8).
The Anumāna-sutta and its Chinese parallels agree that the following qualities will
prevent a monk from receiving advice and criticism:

  - having evil wishes,

  - being prone to anger or angry speech,

  - being of a deceitful nature. [129]
The parallel versions also indicate that it would be detrimental if, in case of being admonished, a monk were to:

  - react disrespectfully,

  - counter accuse,

  - lead the talk aside and display irritation.
The listing of detrimental qualities in the Anumāna-sutta has several qualities not
taken into account in its parallels, such as, for example, dogmatic clinging to one’s own
views. [130] The two Chinese discourses also mention qualities that are absent from the
listing given in the Anumāna-sutta, such as:

  - being without a sense of shame,

  - associating with evil friends,

  - being without gratitude. [131]
From the viewpoint of the discourse’s topic of what will make others hold back their
advice, each of these unwholesome qualities fits the present context well, as dogmatic
clinging to one’s own views will have such an effect, just as lack of shame, evil friendship, or being ungrateful.
The two Chinese versions continue at this point by recommending the following type
of reflection: as I do not like when someone else displays irritation (for example), if I
were to show irritation, others will not like me. Reflecting in this way, one will train to
overcome these detrimental qualities. [132] The Pāli version has a similar reflection only at
the end of its description of a monk who is free from unwholesome qualities. [133] The two
Chinese discourses conclude their exposition of this positive case instead with a posi
129 [[MN15]] at MN I 95,18, [[MA89]] at T I 571c9, and T 50 at T I 842b14. Horner 1938/1982: xxviii notes that
the description of being difficult to admonish at MN I 95,13 recurs in relation to sa�ghādisesa 12 at
Vin III 178,19; on the significance of [[MN15]] for monastic training in medieval Sri Lanka cf. Blackburn
1999: 289.

tive reflection: just as I like someone who does not display irritation (for example), so
others will like me if I do not show irritation. [134] This second positive reflection does not
occur in the Pāli discourse.

不語結住


Chapter 2 Sīhanāda-vagga                                    - 127


ties at the end of their exposition of positive qualities, the Pāli version has only one reflection, namely on negative qualities at the end of its examination of positive qualities
(see table 2.9).


Table 2.9: Progression of the Exposition in [[MN15]] and its Parallels

|[[MN15]]|[[MA89]] & T 50|

The Pāli and Chinese versions advise that a monk should regularly examine himself
concerning the presence or absence of any of these unwholesome qualities. Just as
someone who examines his face in a mirror would quickly remove any stain, in the
same way a monk should endeavour to remove such unwholesome qualities. [136] Just as
the same person would be glad on seeing his or her face free from any stain, so too a
monk who realizes that none of these unwholesome qualities are found in him will joyfully continue to train in what is wholesome.
While the Pāli version concludes at this point, the two Chinese versions continue by
describing that based on such joy tranquillity arises, which leads in a causal sequence
via happiness and concentration to seeing things as they truly are, and via disenchantment and dispassion to liberation and knowledge of liberation. [137] The Pāli commentary
accords a similar potential to the present instruction, as it explains that the reference to
seeing all these unwholesome qualities “abandoned” (pahīna) should be understood to
cover not only temporary abandoning, but also the final abandoning (samucchedappahāna) through awakening. [138]


[[MN16]] Cetokhila-sutta

The Cetokhila-sutta, the “discourse on mental barrenness”, lists five types of mental
barrenness (cetokhila) and five mental bondages (cetaso vinibandha) that prevent one’s
growth in the Dharma. This discourse has a Pāli parallel among the tens of the A�guttara-nikāya and two Chinese parallels, found in the Madhyama-āgama and in the Ekottarika-āgama. [139]


136 [[MN15]] at MN I 100,13, [[MA89]] at T I 572b3, and T 50 at T I 843a10.
137 [[MA89]] at T I 572c5 and T 50 at T I 843b12. A similar conditioned sequence occurs regularly in other
Pāli discourses, cf., e.g., [[AN10.1-5]] at AN V 1-6 or [[AN11.2-5]] at AN V 312-317.
138 Ps II 67,10.
139 The parallels are [[AN10.14]] at AN V 17-21, entitled Cetokhila-sutta; [[MA206]] at T I 780b-781b, entitled
“discourse on mental defilements”, ; and [[EA51.4]] at T II 817a-c. [[MA206]] and [[EA51.4]] agree
with [[MN16]] on locating the discourse in Jeta’s Grove by Sāvatthī. [[AN10.14]] does not specify a loca心穢經



MN I 98


MN I 100


128     - A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


MN I 101 The Majjhima-nikāya version begins by pointing out that a monk who has not abandoned five types of mental barrenness and five types of mental bondage will not be able
to develop in the Dharma. [140] The Madhyama-āgama and Ekottarika-āgama versions as
well as the A�guttara-nikāya discourse have a similar statement, with the difference
that they explicitly include the nuns in their treatment. [141] The same three versions also
make it clear that these types of mental barrenness and mental bondage not only prevent
growth, but spell actual decline. [142]
According to the Majjhima-nikāya and A�guttara-nikāya versions, the five types of
mental barrenness are: [143]

      - having doubts about the teacher,

      - having doubts about the Dharma,

      - having doubts about the Sa�gha,

      - having doubts about the training,

      - being angry with one’s companions in the holy life.
The parallel versions show some variations in their listings of the five types of mental
barrenness (see table 2.10), although they agree in as much as lack of confidence in regard to the Buddha and the Dharma are the first two types of mental barrenness in all
versions.


Table 2.10: Five Types of Mental Barrenness in [[MN16]] and its Parallels








|[[MN16]] & [[AN10.14]]|[[MA206]]|[[EA51.4]]|

Besides these two, the Madhyama-āgama version speaks of lack of confidence in the
precepts, in the instructions, and in those fellow monks who have been praised by the
Buddha. [144] The Ekottarika-āgama account agrees with the Pāli versions on lack of confidence in the Sa�gha as one type of mental barrenness, [145] after which it mentions the

tion. Notably, [[EA51.4]] is found among the elevens of the Ekottarika-āgama, even though it expounds
only ten items. For remarks on [[MA206]] cf. Minh Chau 1964/1991: 95 and 194.

mental barrenness of breaking one’s precepts and not confessing such a breach, and the
mental barrenness of living the holy life with the aspiration of being reborn in a heavenly realm.
The aspiration to be reborn in a heavenly realm occurs also in the two Pāli versions,
where it constitutes one of the five mental bondages. [146] Other discourses qualify this
type of aspiration as a way of getting “caught”, [147] or else of being “bound”. [148] This terminology would fit a placing of this aspiration under the heading of a mental “bondage”.
In addition to being found in the Pāli and Chinese versions of the present discourse,
the five types of mental barrenness recur in the Sa�gīti-sutta and the Dasuttara-sutta, as
well as in their parallels. The Sa�gīti- and Dasuttara-suttas correspond to the presentation found in the two Cetokhila-suttas. [149] Sanskrit fragments of the Daśottara-sūtra
have only preserved the first and the fifth type of mental barrenness, which are doubt in
the teacher and an angry attitude towards one’s fellow monks, thereby agreeing with
their Pāli counterparts. [150] The Chinese Dīrgha-āgama version of the Daśottara-sūtra
has the same two types of mental barrenness as its first and fifth, in addition to which it
speaks of lack of confidence in the Dharma, in the Sa�gha, and in the precepts. [151] Thus
the Chinese Daśottara-sūtra differs from the Pāli presentations only in that it speaks of
confidence in the precepts, instead of confidence in the training.
In its exposition of such lack of confidence in the precepts, the Chinese Daśottarasūtra refers to bad and defiled conduct and to having no respect for the precepts. This
indicates that one who has no confidence in or respect for the precepts will quite probably not adhere to them and indulge in bad conduct. Understood in this way, this passage
would offer a way of bringing together the mental barrenness found in the Pāli Cetokhila-suttas as lack of confidence in the training, in the Madhyama-āgama version as
lack of confidence in the precepts, and in the Ekottarika-āgama version as breaking
one’s precepts and not confessing such a breach. Despite the differences in wording, the
parallel versions could thus be seen to agree on the essential implications of this type of
mental barrenness. [152]


146 [[MN16]] at MN I 102,9 and [[AN10.14]] at AN V 18,24; for a similar aspiration cf. the Śrāvakabhūmi in
Shukla 1973: 47,8 or ŚSG 1998: 76,16 and T 1579 at T XXX 404a6.
147 [[SN35.200]] at SN IV 180,21 and its parallels [[SA1174]] at T II 315a2 and [[EA43.3]] at T II 759a18 consider
the aspiration for a celestial rebirth to be a form of being “caught by non-humans”, amanussaggāho,
.
148 [[AN7.47]] at AN IV 56,1 refers to this type of aspiration as being “bound by the bondage of sexuality”,
sa�yutto methunena sa�yogena (S [e] -AN IV 57,15: saññutto and saññogena), the corresponding statement from a parallel found in the Śik�āsamuccaya in Bendall 1902/1970: 76,14 similarly reads sa�yukto maithunena dharme�a; cf. also Hahn 1977: 207.

152 Although it needs to be noted that lack of confidence in the “training”, sikkhā, in [[MN16]] at MN I
101,17 may not refer only to training in the precepts. According to the commentarial gloss at Ps II
非人取者, 68,33, in the present context the reference to ‘training’ should in fact be understood to encompass the 非人所捉者


130 - A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


The different presentations of the five types of mental barrenness could then be summed up as:

  - lack of confidence in the three jewels,

  - lack of confidence in the precepts together with its resulting bad conduct,

  - a type of attitude towards one’s fellow companions in the holy life that is dominated by anger and lack of confidence.
The first four of these types of mental barrenness would consequently be the direct
opposites of the four limbs of stream-entry, [153] while the fifth mental barrenness would
be a type of attitude that prevents a monk from being able to learn from other monks. [154]
This makes it clear why these five qualities are collected together under the heading of
“mental barrenness”.
After their exposition of the five types of mental barrenness, the Cetokhila-suttas turn
to the five mental bondages, which are:

  - desire for sensual pleasures,

  - desire for the body,

  - desire for form,

  - over-indulging in food and sleep,

  - living the holy life with the aspiration to be reborn in a heavenly realm. [155]
Being under the influence of desire for the body and for sensual pleasures recur as the
first two mental bondages in the Madhyama-āgama version, although in the opposite
sequence (see table 2.11). The same discourse continues its exposition of mental bondages by listing:

  - lack of interest in instructions pertaining to concentration and wisdom (etc.),

  - being confused, arrogant, and given to excessive socialization,

  - being content with having attained little, making no effort to progress further. [156]
The Ekottarika-āgama account of the five mental bondages differs considerably from
its parallels. It agrees with the Cetokhila-suttas in regard to only one of the mental bond

entire path, covering the training in higher moral conduct, adhisīlasikkhā, in higher mental development, adhicittasikkhā, and in higher wisdom, adhipaññāsikkhā.
153 These are perfect confidence in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sa�gha, together with unblemished
moral conduct, found, e.g., in [[DN33]] at DN III 227,6.
154 An illustrative instance can be found at [[SN22.90]] at SN III 134,21 and its parallel [[SA262]] at T II 66c20.
These two discourses begin by describing that the monk Channa was unable to accept the instructions
given to him by other monks. When he finally visited Ānanda and asked for help, Ānanda replied that
Channa, by requesting instruction, had broken his mental barrenness, khila� pabhindi (B [e] -SN II 110,6
and S [e] -SN III 164,19: khīla�, B [e] moreover reads chindi, instead of pabhindi),, and thereby
become fit to understand the Dharma. Bodhi 2000: 1084 note 182 comments that “Channa’s problem
seems to have been the fifth [mental barrenness], anger and contemptuousness towards his fellow
monks”. The same topic recurs also in [[SN35.25]] at [[SNP973]] which instructs to “break the mental barrenness” towards one’s companions in the holy life, khila� pabhinde.
155 [[MN16]] at MN I 101,27 and [[AN10.14]] at AN V 18,14. The five mental bondages recur also in [[DN33]] at
DN III 238,13.
156 [[MA206]] at T I 780c8+15+20.

ages, namely the bondage of fondness for sleep. The other mental bondages in this version are:

  - being lazy,

  - being without concentration,

  - not keeping one’s sense-organs collected,

  - preferring the market to quiet places. [157]
In addition to being found in the Cetokhila-sutta and its parallels, the five types of
mental barrenness occur twice as independent discourses in different parts of the A�guttara-nikāya, notably each time immediately followed by another discourse that takes up
the five mental bondages. [158] This need not be a matter of mere coincidence, but could
point to an inner connection between these two sets of five.

Table 2.11: Five Mental Bondages in [[MN16]] and its Parallels

|[[MN16]] & [[AN10.14]]|[[MA206]]|
|---|---|
|desire for sensual pleasures (1)<br>desire for body (2)<br>desire for form (3)<br>overeating & sleeping (4)<br>wish for heavenly rebirth (5)|desire for body (→ 2)<br>desire for sensual pleasures (→ 1)<br>not interested in instructions<br>confused, arrogant, socializing<br>no effort to progress further<br>(≠ 3-5)|



The five types of mental barrenness are concerned with the affective nature of the
mind, exposing the type of attitude that will fail to generate the inspiration and enthusiasm required for progress. [159] The five mental bondages (in their Pāli version) are similarly concerned with the affective nature of the mind. Here the problem is, however, not
a lack of development, but rather a development in the wrong direction, since the five


157 [[EA51.4]] at T II 817b6+10+12+13.
158 These are [[AN5.205]] at AN III 248 and [[AN9.71]] AN IV 460, followed immediately by [[AN5.206]] at AN
III 249 and [[AN9.72]] at AN IV 461, respectively. The same two sets are also found together in [[DN33]] at
DN III 237,24 and DN III 238,13, as well as in the Sa�gītiparyāya, T 1536 at T XXVI 416b29 and
418a13. For a single occurrence of the five cetokhīlas cf. [[DN34]] at DN III 278,12 (cf. also Sanskrit fragment [[SN362]]V7-R2 in Mittal 1957: 34); single occurrences of the five cetasovinibandhas can be found in
[[AN9.82]] at AN IV 463,1 and in [[AN9.92]] at AN IV 464,8.
159 To evoke this negative nuance the term khila appears particularly appropriate, as according to MW:
340 khila stands for a “piece of waste or uncultivated land situated between cultivated fields”.


132     - A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


mental bondages are desire for sensual pleasures, for the body, for forms, for food and
sleep, and for the pleasures of a heavenly rebirth.
Consequently these two sets of five can be brought together as a set of ten types of
affective obstruction, being either a lack of developing appropriate sentiments or else
misdirected sentiments, each of which will undermine the inspiration and enthusiasm
required for progress.
The A�guttara-nikāya version illustrates the detrimental effect of the five types of
mental barrenness and of the five mental bondages with the image of the waning moon,
which decreases every day in roundness, splendour, and beauty. [160] Freedom from these
ten obstructions is then comparable to the waxing moon, which every day increases in
roundness, splendour, and beauty.
The Ekottarika-āgama discourse instead compares the detrimental effect of these ten
obstructions to a hen that does not properly hatch her eggs, as a result of which the
chicks will not come to growth and maturity. [161] The case of a hen that properly hatches
her eggs then illustrates the case of a monk or a nun who overcomes these obstructions.
The Ekottarika-āgama discourse concludes by predicting that a monk or a nun who has
overcome the five types of mental barrenness can be sure of a favourable rebirth, either
in a heavenly realm or as a human being. [162]

MN I 103   While the two versions found in the respective numerical collections, the A�guttaranikāya and the Ekottarika-āgama, come to a conclusion at this point, the two middle
length versions, found in the Majjhima-nikāya and Madhyama-āgama, continue further.
These two versions take up five more qualities to be developed: the four ways to [psychic] power (iddhipāda) and exertion. [163] It is at this point that these two versions also
have the simile of the hen and her eggs, explaining that just as the chicks will come to
growth when a hen has properly hatched her eggs, so a monk endowed with the four
ways to [psychic] power and with exertion will be able to reach awakening. [164]


[[MN17]] Vanapattha-sutta

The Vanapattha-sutta, the “discourse on [living in a] forest thicket”, sets out the conditions under which a monk should leave or else remain in the place where he is staying.
This discourse has two parallels in consecutive discourses in the Madhyama-āgama. [165]

160 [[AN10.14]] at AN V 19,8.
161 [[EA51.4]] at T II 817b17. This simile recurs in [[MN53]] at MN I 357,6. Another occurrence is [[SN22.101]]
at SN III 153,14, with a Gāndhārī discourse parallel in Glass 2007: 137, Senior Kharo��hī fragment 5
lines 40-41, and another parallel in [[SA263]] at T II 67b1. The simile is also found in [[AN7.67]] at AN IV
125,18. Yet another occurrence is [[AN8.11]] at AN IV 176,7, with a parallel in [[MA157]] at T I 679c4.
162 [[EA51.4]] at T II 817c13.
163 [[MN16]] at MN I 103,36: usso�hi (Be-MN I 149,2 here reads usso�hī, but later on twice: usso�hi, Ce also
shows some variations between these two alternatives) and [[MA206]] at T I 781b8: .
164 [[MN16]] at MN I 104,11 and [[MA206]] at T I 781b14.
165 The parallels are [[MA107]] and [[MA108]] at T I 596c-598b, both entitled “discourse on the forest”, .
Both agree with [[MN17]] on locating the discourse in Jeta’s Grove by Sāvatthī.

A few lines of this discourse have also been preserved in a Sanskrit fragment. [166] Parts of
the treatment given in the Vanapattha-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallels recur,
moreover, in a discourse in the A�guttara-nikāya and in its parallel in the Ekottarikaāgama. [167]
The Vanapattha-sutta and its two Madhyama-āgama parallels examine four situations
a monk might face when living in a forest thicket: his meditation may either improve or
not improve, and in each of these two cases requisites (such as food, robes, dwelling
place, and medicine) may be easy or difficult to obtain. [168] The three versions present
these four cases in different sequences (see table 2.12).


Table 2.12: Four Situations of a Meditating Monk in [[MN17]] and its Parallels

|[[MN17]]|[[MA107]] & [[MA108]]|
|---|---|
|no improvement and scarce requisites (1)<br>no improvement and ample requisites (2)<br>improvement and scarce requisites (3)<br>improvement and ample requisites (4)|no improvement and ample requisites (→ 2)<br>improvement and scarce requisites (→ 3)<br>no improvement and scarce requisites (→ 1)<br>improvement and ample requisites (→ 4)|



The parallel versions agree, however, about what should be done in each of these four
cases. Thus they advise that when the meditation practice does not improve and requisites are difficult to obtain, the monk should leave immediately.
Even when requisites are easy to obtain, but the meditation practice does not improve,
the monk should leave, reflecting that he did not go forth for the sake of requisites. [169] If
the meditation practice improves, however, the monk should stay.
If, in addition to this, requisites are easy to obtain, according to all versions he may
stay even for his whole life. The Vanapattha-sutta and its two Madhyama-āgama parallels apply the same pattern to living:

  - in a village,

  - in a township,

  - in dependence on a person. [170]

166 SHT VI 1304 (p. 74), paralleling among others the expressions “forest thicket” at MN I 105,1, “requisites of life” at MN I 105,6, and “resting place” at MN I 105,7.
167 [[AN9.6]] at AN IV 366,6 examines the case of living in dependence on a person from a fourfold perspective, similar to [[MN17]] [[EA45.3]] at T II 771c18 takes up the case of living in dependence on a village,
which it considers from two perspectives: unwholesome states increase and requisites are easy to obtain
([[EA45.3]] at T II 771c22 actually speaks of, which judging from the context should probably
rather be ), or else wholesome states increase and requisites are difficult to obtain. In relation to these two possibilities, its injunctions are similar to [[MN17]]
168 While [[MN17]] at MN I 104,26 and [[MA107]] at T II 596c28 discuss progress in meditation in terms of developing mindfulness and concentration, eradicating the influxes, and gaining liberation, [[MA108]] at T I
597c14 refers to the same only in a summary form, as “gaining a recluse’s objectives”, .
169 [[MN17]] at MN I 105,23, [[MA107]] at T I 597a9, and [[MA108]] at T I 597c20.
170 [[MN17]] at MN I 106,22 speaks not only of living in a village, gāma, or a township, nigama, but also of
living in a fortified city, nagara, or a country, janapada. Instead of a fortified city or a country, MĀ

While the Chinese versions do not work out these applications in detail, the Pāli discourse gives the case of living in dependence on another person in full, indicating that
when requisites are scarce and meditation does not improve, the monk may leave even
without informing his supporter. [171] In case requisites are plenty and meditation improves, he should try to stay even if told to leave. [172]
The last suggestion is somewhat surprising, since for a monk who lives in dependence
on a lay supporter there seems to be little scope to stay if he is told to leave.


[[MN18]] Madhupi��ika-sutta

The Madhupi��ika-sutta, the “discourse on the honey ball”, records Mahākaccāna
giving a detailed explanation of an enigmatic statement by the Buddha. This discourse
has two Chinese parallels, found in the Madhyama-āgama and in the Ekottarika-āgama. [173]

MN I 108  The Madhupi��ika-sutta and its parallels begin by reporting that the Sakyan Da��apā�i visited the Buddha and inquired after the kind of a teaching the Buddha had proclaimed. [174] In the Majjhima-nikāya and the Madhyama-āgama versions, the Buddha’[[SN107]] at T I 597c8 and [[MA108]] at T I 598b3 mention dwelling in a cemetery. Pande 1957: 120 considers
this part of [[MN17]] to be a later addition, since the title and the introductory statement only announces
an exposition on the forest thicket, [[MN17]] at MN I 104,21: vanapatthapariyāya. Pande suggests that the
part that applies the same pattern to villages, townships, and cities would have been added after the
monks’ life style had changed from forest life to town dwelling.
171 [[MN17]] at MN I 106,34: anāpucchā pakkamitabbo (Be-MN I 152,19 and Ce-MN I 268,26: pakkamitabba�).
172 [[MN17]] at MN I 108,8: na pakkamitabba�, api panujjamānena (Se-MN I 219,13 : api samujjamānena).
Neumann 1896/1995: 126, perhaps more guided by context than by the actual wording of the passage,
translates: “nicht fortgehen, wenn er nicht fortgejagt wird”, conveying the sense that the monk should
not leave unless he is sent away. Ps II 72,26, however, understands the instruction to mean that the
monk should stay even if told to leave, in fact it holds that the monk should even stay if his host were
to use a stick to drive him out.
173 The parallels are [[MA115]] at T I 603b-605a, entitled “discourse on the simile of the honey ball”,
, and [[EA40.10]] at T II 743a-c, which concludes with the Buddha giving the discourse the title “the
taste of the ambrosial Dharma”, T II 743c28: . The three versions agree on locating the discourse at Kapilavatthu in the Sakyan country. [[MA115]] has been studied and translated by Minh Chau
1964/1991: 29, 59 and 233-239.
174 Mahāva�[[SA2]].19 at Be-Mhv 9 indicates that Da��apā�i was a brother of Suppabuddha, the Buddha’s
father-in-law. According to the Lalitavistara in Hokazono 1994: 592,16 or Lefmann 1902: 157,3 or
Vaidya 1958b: 108,19 (on the Chinese versions cf. Peri 1918: 11), and according to the Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1977: 62,1, however, he was himself the Buddha’s father-in-law. All versions depict
Da��apā�i holding onto his stick while questioning the Buddha, which conveys a somewhat arrogant
or even provocative attitude; cf. the regulation at Vin IV 200,25 against teaching the Dharma to some- 蜜丸喻
one who is holding a stick. Rahula 1981: 160 remarks on the present passage that 經 “the attitude of Da��a-pā�i ... was surely haughty”, and Ireland 1992: 116 goes so far as to liken Da��apā�i’s attitude and 甘露法味
behaviour to Māra. His arrogant or even provocative attitude could be an expression of his disapproval
at the going forth of his son-in-law or nephew.


Chapter 2 Sīhanāda-vagga                                    - 135


reply indicates his teaching to be of such a nature that it leads to the absence of quarrelling with anyone in the world and to freedom from sensual desires and craving. [175] Da��apā�i thereupon left, according to the Majjhima-nikāya version expressing his bewilderment by wagging his tongue and raising his eyebrows. [176]
The Buddha then related his encounter with Da��apā�i to the monks. When one of
the monks asked the Buddha to elucidate the statement made earlier to Da��apā�i, according to the Pāli account the Buddha made a somewhat enigmatic statement about not
delighting in perceptions and notions that arise due to conceptual proliferation (papañcasaññāsa�kha), explaining that in this way freedom from the underlying tendencies
and from quarrels, false speech, and evil states can be reached. [177] According to the
Madhyama-āgama version, the Buddha spoke in praise of detachment in regard to past,
present, and future phenomena, explaining that such detachment will lead to freedom
from the underlying tendencies, from quarrelling, and from other evil states. [178]
The Madhupi��ika-sutta and its parallels agree that the Buddha retired without further explanations, upon which the monks approached Mahākaccāna for a clarification
of the Buddha’s statement. [179] The three versions report in similar terms how Mahākaccāna rebuked the monks for approaching him instead of directly asking the Buddha,
which he compared to someone in need of heartwood who takes only the branches and
leaves of a tree. [180]


175 [[MN18]] at MN I 108,26 and [[MA115]] at T I 603b19. After pointing out that the Buddha’s teaching is beyond the ken of devas, nāgas, and other spirits, [[EA40.10]] at T II 743a10 indicates that it leads to the absence of attachment to the world and to not being established in the world, .
176 [[MN18]] at MN I 109,1.
177 [[MN18]] at MN I 109,34.
178 [[MA115]] at T I 603c12. According to [[EA40.10]] at T II 743a20, the Buddha’s reply was concerned with
the absence of attachment to the world, freedom from sensuality, and overcoming doubt. Part of this
passage in [[EA40.10]] is a repetition of the Buddha’s earlier statement to Da��apā�i at T II 743a10 (cf.
above note 175), nevertheless the present repetition differs from the earlier statement found just a few
lines before in [[EA40.10]] Moreover, when it comes to Mahākaccāna repeating the Buddha’s statements
before beginning his own exposition (T II 743b11 and T II 743c10), the statements quoted by him differ
again from what is found in the present instance. Such irregularities seem to be a recurrent feature in
Ekottarika-āgama discourses. 非著世, 復非住世
179 According to Ps III 319,7, Mahākaccāna was the son of the chaplain of Ujjenī, the capital of Avanti.
The Mahāvastu in Basak 1968/2004: 231,16+25 or in Senart 1897: 386,8+17 and the Sa�ghabhedavastu
in Gnoli 1977: 57,3+7, however, identify him with Nālaka/Nālada (cf. the protagonist of the Nālakasutta, [[SNP3.11]] at [[SNP679-723]]).
180 [[MN18]] at MN I 111,6, [[MA115]] at T I 604a14, and [[EA40.10]] at T II 743a29. When speaking in praise of
the Buddha during this reply, according to [[MN18]] at MN I 111,13 Mahākaccāna referred to the Buddha
with the epithet brahmabhūto, literally “become Brahmā”, an expression without an equivalent in [[MA115]] or [[EA40.10]] The same epithet recurs in [[MN133]] at MN III 195,6 and in [[MN138]] at MN III 224,28,
where in both cases it is also absent from their Chinese parallels [[MA165]] and [[MA164]] Pérez-remón
1980: 115 suggests that the epithet brahmabhūto and the preceding dhammabhūto could be later additions, “because what follows such dithyrambic epithets seems to be an anticlimax”, as “dhammabhūto,
where the Buddha is shown as dhamma personified” is followed by “dhammassāmī, where he appears
merely as the lord of dhamma”.

136     - A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


MN I 111 As an explanation of the Buddha’s enigmatic statement, according to the Pāli version
Mahākaccāna described how based on each sense-organ and its object the related type
of consciousness arises. With the coming together of the three there is contact, which
leads to feeling, perception, thought, and conceptual proliferation (papañca), followed
in turn by the arising of notions and perceptions due to conceptual proliferation in regard to past, present, and future times. [181] The explanations in the Chinese versions proceed similarly, although with the difference that their descriptions of the stages that follow the arising of thought employ different terminology. [182] The basic import of the passage nevertheless appears to be alike in the three versions.

MN I 112 The Madhupi��ika-sutta and its parallels continue with Mahākaccāna explaining that
this conditional sequence does not take place in the absence of the sense-organs, their
objects, and the corresponding type of consciousness, but only happens when these are
present. [183] They differ in the sequence in which they present these two cases (see table

In all versions, Mahākaccāna tells the monks that they may report his explanation to
the Buddha. When the monks follow this suggestion, the Buddha expresses his approval
of Mahākaccāna’s exposition. [184]

MN I 114   In the Pāli account, Ānanda comes out with a simile at this point, comparing the delight to be derived from examining this exposition to a hungry man who comes upon a
ball of honey. [185] The Ekottarika-āgama version also attributes the simile to Ānanda, [186]

agrees with [[MN18]] at MN I 112,15 on speaking of “designation”, paññatti/, in regard to contact

185 [[MN18]] at MN I 114,9. The same simile recurs in [[AN5.194]] at AN III 237,19. Regarding Ānanda’s use
of similes in general, a survey of the four Pāli Nikāyas brings to light that in most of the close to forty
discourses attributed to him he does not use a simile at all. In ten discourses, Ānanda makes use of a
simile that is, however, also found elsewhere: [[DN10]] at DN I 204-210 reports Ānanda giving an ac- 念 分別
count of the gradual path together with the same similes used in the preceding DN discourses as part of
the same type of exposition given by the Buddha. In [[MN53]] at MN I 357, 稱量 想著之念 6 Ānanda uses the simile of a
hen hatching eggs, a simile delivered by the Buddha according to [[MN16]] at MN I 104,3, [[SN22.101]] at
施設


Chapter 2 Sīhanāda-vagga                                    - 137


while in the Madhyama-āgama version it is the Buddha himself who comes out with the
simile. [187]
Another difference is that while the Majjhima-nikāya version of the simile describes a
man who is hungry and comes upon a ball of honey, according to the Madhyama-āgama version the point made by this simile is that just as one will get a sweet taste from
any morsel of a ball of honey, so too one can get the taste of this teaching by contemplating any of the six sense-doors, be it the eye, the ear, the nose, the tongue, the body,
or the mind. [188]
When comparing these two versions of the simile of the honey ball, the Majjhimanikāya version’s simile does not appear to stand in a particular relation to the Madhupi��ika-sutta’s exposition, since it merely portrays how Mahākaccāna was able to assuage the ‘hunger’ of the monks for a more detailed exposition of a short saying by the
Buddha. The Madhupi��ika-sutta is, however, not the only such case, since other discourses similarly report how Mahākaccāna delivered a more detailed exposition of an
enigmatic statement by the Buddha. [189] Hence the simile of the hungry man who comes

SN III 154,10, [[AN7.67]] at AN IV 125,18, and [[AN8.11]] at AN IV 176,7. Four discourses, [[SN35.116]] at
SN IV 94,24, [[SN35.117]] at SN IV 99,27, [[SN35.193]] at SN IV 167,29, and [[AN10.115]] at AN V 226,18
report Ānanda using the simile of someone in search for heartwood, a simile often associated with the
Buddha and in some instances also with Mahākaccāna, cf., e.g., [[MN18]] at MN I 111,6, [[MN133]] at MN
III 194,32, [[MN138]] at MN III 224,21, and [[AN10.172]] at AN V 256,22. In [[SN35.192]] at SN IV 166,1,
Ānanda uses the simile of two oxen, a simile attributed to Sāriputta in [[SN35.191]] at SN IV 163,12 and
to Citta in [[SN41.1]] at SN IV 282,32. In [[AN10.5]] at AN V 6,12 and [[AN11.5]] at AN V 316,4, Ānanda
uses the simile of a tree without branches, found in similar terms as a simile delivered by the Buddha in
[[AN5.24]] at AN III 19,29, [[AN6.50]] at AN III 360,9, [[AN7.61]] at AN IV 99,9, [[AN8.81]] at AN IV 336,13,
[[AN10.3]] at AN V 4,14, and [[AN11.3]] at AN V 314,8, and also by Sāriputta in [[AN5.168]] at AN III
200,12, [[AN10.4]] at AN V 5,16, and [[AN11.4]] at AN V 315,16. [[AN10.95]] at AN V 194,23 reports Ānanda using the simile of a guarded city, used Sāriputta according to [[DN16]] at DN II 83,8, [[DN28]] at DN III
100,25, and [[SN47.12]] at SN V 160,17. Only two discourses depict Ānanda coming out with a simile
unique to the respective occasion: [[MN76]] at MN I 523,20 and [[SN51.15]] at SN V 272,30. In sum, the
Pāli discourses do not present the deliverance of impromptu similes as a typical trait of Ānanda, whereas the Buddha is shown to deliver an inexhaustible wealth of similes. An extract from the present discussion already appeared in Anālayo 2005b: 7-8 and id. 2007i: 25-27.
186 [[EA40.10]] at T II 743c24, which speaks of ambrosia,, instead of a honey ball.
187 [[MA115]] at T I 604c22. A similar case can be found in relation to [[DN4]] at DN I 124,5, where a simile
that illustrates the relationship between morality and wisdom with two hands washing each other is attributed in the Pāli version to a Brahmin visitor, whereas in the Chinese parallel, [[DA22]] at T I 96b18
(translated in Meisig 1991: 57), the Buddha himself comes out with the simile. Gombrich 1984a: 99
comments on this simile that its presentation of morality and wisdom as complementary factors stands
“in stark contrast to the Hindu view that the disciplines of work and of gnosis are hierarchically related
alternatives”. This might make it more fitting for the simile to be attributed to the Buddha, instead of to
a non-Buddhist Brahmin who had just attempted to uphold Brahminical views in front of the Buddha.
Another statement attributed to the Buddha reflects in fact a similar interrelationship (although expressed in terms of Dharma and Vinaya), cf. [[AN10.44]] at AN III 106, 甘露 13: dhammasandosā vinayasandoso, vinayasandosā dhammasandoso, cf. also SHT X 2272 (p. 274) Vc and Rb.

across a honey ball would fit those other instances just as well as the Madhupi��ikasutta.
The Madhyama-āgama presentation of the same simile suits the penetrative analysis
of the perceptual process given by Mahākaccāna well and thus is more closely related to
the actual content of the discourse. It also brings out the simile of the honey ball with
increased clarity, indicating that the penetrative analysis of the perceptual process offered in this discourse can lead to realization when applied to any sense-door, just as a
honey ball is sweet wherever one may bite it.
While the other two versions conclude at this point, the Madhyama-āgama version
continues with an exhortation by the Buddha on the importance of this discourse and on
the need to keep it in mind. [190]


[[MN19]] Dvedhāvitakka-sutta

The Dvedhāvitakka-sutta, the “discourse on two kinds of thoughts”, records the Buddha’s pre-awakening division of thoughts into wholesome and unwholesome types. [191]
This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama. [192]

MN I 114   The Dvedhāvitakka-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel report in closely similar
terms how the Buddha, during the time before his awakening, developed a clear distinction between the three types of unwholesome thought and their opposites. Realizing that
unwholesome thoughts lead to one’s own harm and the harm of others, he made an effort to dispel such thoughts. [193]

MN I 115   Both versions illustrate the bodhisattva’s ability to quickly dispel any unwholesome
thought with the help of a simile. This simile describes a cowherd who has to guard the
cows closely in order to prevent them from straying into ripe crops, since, if they were
to do so, that would cause him to be punished. Similar to the cowherd’s fear of punish

190 [[MA115]] at T I 604c29. As a little postscript to Mahākaccāna’s depiction of how in the absence of contact the above described sequence of the perceptual process does not occur, [[SA273]] at T II 72c8 (translated in Choong 1999: 39) would be of interest, a discourse that does not have a parallel in the Pāli Nikāyas. [[SA273]] also presents contact as the coming together of sense-organ, object, and consciousness,
which in turn leads to feeling, perception, and thought, followed by comparing such coming together of
sense and object to the sound caused by clapping both hands. Applying this simile to the absence of
contact described in Mahākaccāna’s exposition might provide a hint at the implications of the famous
kōan ( ) that inquires after the sound of the clapping of a single hand, devised by the Japanese Zen
master Hakuin Ekaku (1685-1768 or 1686-1769).
191 The same twofold distinction of thoughts recurs as a discourse on its own in It 3:4:8 at It 82,9+21.
192 The parallel is [[MA102]] at T I 589a-590a, entitled “discourse on thoughts”, . [[MA102]] agrees with
[[MN19]] on locating the discourse in Jeta’s Grove by Sāvatthī. Parts of [[MA102]] have been translated by
Bareau 1963: 63-66. [[MA102]] has been studied and partially translated by Minh Chau 1964/1991: 33,
194-195.
193 [[MN19]] at MN I 115,1 and [[MA102]] at T I 589a18, which specifies that this type of practice was undertaken while the Buddha was dwelling alone and in seclusion, . A quotation from this part
of the discourse can be found in the *Mahāvibhā�ā, T 1545 at T XXVII 226b11.

ment, apprehension of the unwholesome consequences of such thoughts is the means to
dispel them. [194]
According to the Madhyama-āgama version, after delivering this simile the Buddha
explained that one’s mind will take delight in whatever one frequently thinks about. [195]
A similar statement occurs also in the Majjhima-nikāya version, according to which the
Buddha pointed out that whatever one frequently thinks about will cause a corresponding inclination of the mind. [196] The two versions differ, however, in the sequence of their
presentation (see table 2.14).


Table 2.14: Analysis of Unwholesome Thought in [[MN19]] and [[MA102]]

|[[MN19]]|[[MA102]]|
|---|---|
|unwholesome thought is harmful (1)<br>frequent thinking causes mental habit (2)<br>simile of cowherd (3)|unwholesome thought is harmful (→ 1)<br>simile of cowherd (→ 3)<br>frequent thinking causes mental habit (→ 2)|



Thus the Dvedhāvitakka-sutta first takes up the future Buddha’s reflection on the danger inherent in unwholesome thought, next describes how the mind follows the course
set by whatever one frequently thinks about, and then comes out with the simile of the
cowherd. The Madhyama-āgama parallel version instead follows the topic of unwholesome thought with the simile of the cowherd, and only then turns to the general nature
of the mind being influenced by what one often thinks about. In this way, the Madhyama-āgama discourse offers a somewhat clearer progression of ideas, as the main purpose of the cowherd’s simile would be to illustrate fear of unwanted consequences, not
to exemplify that frequent thoughts of a particular type lead to a corresponding mental
inclination.
The two versions continue by taking up the case of wholesome thoughts, which due to
their harmless nature are allowed to continue. This is comparable to the cowherd being
able to relax, once the harvest has been brought in. In regard to these wholesome
thoughts, both versions report the Buddha reflecting that too much thinking, even of
such a wholesome nature, will obstruct the development of concentration, a reflection
that motivated him to steady his mind internally and let it become concentrated. [197]
Becoming concentrated in this way leads in both versions to the attainment of the four
jhānas. While in the Dvedhāvitakka-sutta the attainment of the jhānas is still part of the
future Buddha’s own pre-awakening development, [198] in its Madhyama-āgama parallel

the subject of the sentence changes from the Buddha to a monk in general, who by overcoming wholesome thoughts will be able to attain the jhānas. [199] Another difference in
relation to the same statement is that the Chinese version proceeds directly from leaving
behind wholesome thoughts to the attainment of the second jhāna, while the Pāli
version includes the first jhāna in its account. [200] The Dvedhāvitakka-sutta continues after the four jhānas with the attainment of the three higher knowledges. The Madhyamaāgama parallel, however, mentions only the third of these, the destruction of the influxes. [201]
Both discourses continue with the simile of a man who tries to lure a deer herd into a
false path by covering up the right path, in order to bring about their ruin. [202] Both versions contrast this with another man who reopens the right path, motivated by the wish
to protect the deer herd. Similar to the second of these two men, the Buddha has opened
up the right path for his disciples, namely the noble eightfold path.
The two versions close with the Buddha exhorting the monks that they should retire
into seclusion and meditate, lest they later regret it. [203]


[[MN20]] Vitakkasa��hāna-sutta

The Vitakkasa��hāna-sutta, the “discourse on stilling thoughts”, describes five methods for overcoming unwholesome thoughts. This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama, entitled “discourse on the higher mind”. [204] This title fits the contents of


199 [[MA102]] at T I 589c7: ... ... .
200 A similar absence of the first jhāna can be found in [[MN125]] at MN III 136,27, which proceeds directly
from overcoming thoughts to the second jhāna. In this case, however, the parallel [[MA198]] at T I 758b26
does refer to the first jhāna. Notably, in the case of [[MN125]] and [[MA198]] as well as in the present case
of [[MN19]] and [[MA102]] the jhāna treatments are preceded by a reference to leaving behind thinking.
This suggests that the omission of the first jhāna in [[MN125]] and in [[MA102]] may be a transmission
error that happened during oral recitation, where the circumstance that a leaving behind of “thought”
(vitakka) has just been mentioned may have misled the reciter(s) to continue with the standard formulation of the second jhāna, which mentions such leaving behind of vitakka, thereby unintentionally
omitting to recite the first jhāna; cf. also Anālayo 2012d.
201 In regard to this difference, it needs to be kept in mind that [[MA102]] is no longer concerned with the 若比丘 得第二禪成就遊 得第四禪成就遊
Buddha’s own approach to awakening, but only with the practice of a monk in general. Bareau 1963,
possibly influenced by the Pāli parallel, translates this passage as if it were representing the Buddha’s
own awakening (p. 76) and then discusses it as an account that differs from the standard descriptions of
the Buddha’s awakening (p. 81). A close inspection of the present passage, however, shows that whereas the part concerned with the presence of wholesome thoughts still refers to the Buddha’s own experience, the development of the jhānas and the subsequent destruction of the influxes in [[MA102]] at T I
589c6 has a “monk” as its subject,, a change of subject already noted by Schmithausen 1981: 221

204 The parallel is [[MA101]] at T I 588a-589a,, which agrees with [[MN20]] on locating the discourse in Jeta’s Grove by Sāvatthī. [[MA101]] has been studied and translated by Minh Chau 1964/1991:

both discourses somewhat better than the Pāli title, since to “still thoughts”, or more
precisely to “still thought-formations”, vitakkasa�khārasa��hāna, is only one of the five
methods described in both discourses. In contrast, all five methods are recommended in
both versions for the purpose of developing the “higher mind”, adhicitta. [205]
According to the Vitakkasa��hāna-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel, the first
method to counter the arising of unwholesome thoughts is to direct attention towards
something wholesome instead. The two discourses explain that undertaking this method
successfully will lead to one-pointedness of the mind and concentration, [206] a qualification applied in both versions to each of the five methods.
The Pāli discourse illustrates the procedure of directing attention towards something
wholesome in order to overcome unwholesome thoughts with the example of a carpenter who removes a coarse peg with the help of a finer peg. [207] The Chinese version employs a different simile, which describes how a carpenter draws a straight line on a
piece of wood and then cuts the wood straight. [208]
Both similes fit the context, since the task is as much one of straightening out the
mind as it is one of replacing coarse types of thought with the help of finer ones. The
Pāli simile additionally conveys the idea of a gradual procedure. Just as it is not possible
to simply pull out the coarse peg, wherefore it has to be at first replaced with a finer peg,
similarly with unwholesome thoughts it is at times not possible to just stop them and
develop concentration right away. Instead, one proceeds through an intermediate stage
by developing wholesome thoughts. These replace the unwholesome thoughts and serve
as a stepping board for eventually being able to completely let go of all thoughts and
develop concentration.
According to both versions, in case this first method should not be successful, the
next method to be applied is to reflect on the danger in unwholesome thoughts. Such
reflection is comparable to the disgust felt by someone who finds the corpse of a snake,
or a dog, or even of a dead human has been hung around his or her neck. [209]
The Vitakkasa��hāna-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel agree that the third
method is to shift attention away from the unwholesome thoughts, to forget about them,


200, 240-244; a brief survey of [[MN20]] can be found in Anālayo 2009u. A presentation of the five
methods for settling thoughts can also be found in Yogācārabhūmi, cf. Delhey 2009a: 224,11 and T
1579 at T XXX 343c7; cf. also the Saundaranandakāvya 16:72-83 in Johnston 1928: 120-121.
205 [[MN20]] at MN I 119,3: adhicittam anuyuttena, [[MA101]] at T I 588a6: . [[MN20]] at MN I 119,3
and [[MA101]] at T I 588a8 also agree on referring to these five methods as “signs”, nimitta/ . The summary verse (uddāna) for the Sīhanāda-vagga in B [e] -MN I 172,9, C [e] -MN I 308,2, and S [e] -MN I 247,18 refers to [[MN20]] as pañcanimittakathā, “the talk on the five signs”, which confirms the impression that all
five methods are characteristic for this discourse, not only the fourth method. A comparison of these
five methods with approaches employed in present-day psychology can be found in de Silva 2001.

just as someone who does not want to see something might just close his or her eyes, or
turn away. [210]
The Pāli instructions for the fourth method are that attention should be given to “stilling the thought-formation”, an expression that perhaps refers to calming the volitional
driving force active behind those thoughts. [211] A similar nuance emerges in the Chinese
parallel, which recommends employing volitional formations in order to gradually reduce such thoughts. [212] The two versions agree in illustrating this with the simile of
someone who, instead of walking fast might walk slower, or even stand, or sit, or finally
lie down. [213]
The fifth and final method in both versions is the use of force to restrain the mind, just
as a strong person could use force to overpower a weaker person. [214]

MN I 122   Both discourses proclaim that practising these five methods will lead to mastery over
thoughts, in the sense of becoming able to have only the type of thoughts that one really
wants to think.
The Pāli version continues by proclaiming that in this way an end of dukkha has been
reached and craving has been eradicated, a proclamation not found in its Chinese counterpart. This proclamation comes somewhat unexpected, and on reading it one could almost have the impression as if mere control of thoughts automatically leads to full
awakening.
A closer inspection of this passage in the Vitakkasa��hāna-sutta reveals that the overcoming of craving, of the fetters, and of conceit, together with the making an end of
dukkha, are formulated in the past tense, whereas the ability to think whatever thought
one wants to think stands in the future tense. [215] For freedom from dukkha and craving to

thought-formation-stilling”, which Soma 1981: 3 translates as “removal of the (thought) source”.
212 [[MA101]] at T I 588b26 instructs that one “should through volitional formations gradually decrease these

[unwholesome] thoughts”, .
213 [[MN20]] at MN I 120,22 and [[MA101]] at T I 588b29.
214 [[MN20]] at MN I 121,5 and [[MA101]] at T I 588c21. Hecker 1987: 526 remarks that although this method
is merely a last resort, only too often it is the first that comes to mind when unwholesome thoughts arise.
Bronkhorst 1993/2000: xii, id. 1999: 86, and King 1980/1992: 10 consider the instruction given in the
present instance to stand in contrast to the inclusion of the same practice in [[MN36]] at MN I 242,26
among exercises that had not been able to lead the bodhisattva to awakening. Yet, [[MN20]] is not presenting this exercise as something that on its own results in awakening, but rather as a last resort in case
all other attempts to deal with the arising of unwholesome thoughts have failed. Thus, even though to
restrain the mind forcefully is not a method that will result in awakening, it does come into its place in
order to stop unwholesome thoughts and thereby prevent their spilling over into unwholesome actions. 當以思行漸減其念

stand in a meaningful relationship to mastery of thoughts, the usage of the tenses
should be the opposite way. This suggests the reference to full awakening to be out of
place in the Vitakkasa��hāna-sutta, perhaps being the result of an error that occurred
during the transmission of the discourse. [216]


216 The same passage occurs also at the end of the Sabbāsava-sutta. In this case, however, the actions leading to the overcoming of craving, of the fetters, and of conceit, and to the making an end of dukkha are
also in the past tense, so that, from a grammatical viewpoint, the passage fits its context; cf. [[MN2]] at
MN I 12,3, which speaks of āsavā ... pahīnā honti before coming to acchecchi ta�ha�, etc. In [[MN2]]
this passage also fits from the point of view of content and is, moreover, found in the two parallels, [[MA10]] at T I 432c26 and T 31 at T I 814b2.


## Chapter 3 Opamma-vagga

[[MN21]] Kakacūpama-sutta

The Kakacūpama-sutta, the “discourse on the simile of the saw”, is the first
discourse in the third chapter of the Majjhima-nikāya, which in the Asian editions has
the title “chapter on similes”. [1] The Kakacūpama-sutta offers a detailed instruction on
the importance of patience. This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama. [2]
The Kakacūpama-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel report that the monk Moliya Phagguna was living in too close association with the nuns, to the extent that he
would get irritated and upset when someone criticized the nuns, just as they would get
irritated and upset if someone criticized him.
According to both versions, the Buddha called Moliya Phagguna to his presence and
told him that, since he had left behind the household life, he should also leave behind
sensual thinking related to the household life. [3] The Majjhima-nikāya version stands
alone in envisaging the possibility that the nuns or Moliya Phagguna might be abused
or even physically attacked, in which case Moliya Phagguna should remain unaffected
and full of compassion. [4]
The Kakacūpama-sutta and its parallel continue by illustrating the willing compliance of the monks of earlier times to the Buddha’s injunction to eat only once a day
with the examples of a skilled charioteer, [5] who is able to drive a chariot wherever he
likes, and of a grove of sāla trees that is cared for and therefore grows well. [6]

1995: 143). E [e] speaks instead of the Tatiya-vagga, “Third Chapter”. As Norman 1983a: 45 comments,
“since six of the ten suttas have the word upama in their title”, it would indeed be “appropriate to call it
Opammavagga”; cf. also Horner 1954/1967: xi.
2 The parallel is [[MA193]] at T I 744a-746b, has the title “discourse on Moliya Phagguna”,,
and agrees with [[MN21]] in locating the discourse in Jeta’s Grove by Sāvatthī. For an extract from [[MA193]] cf. Minh Chau 1964/1991: 198-199. A partial parallel is [[EA50.8]] at T II 812c-813b, which begins
with the same situation concerning Moliya Phagguna. In [[EA50.8]] however, he proclaims his conviction
that sensuality is not an obstruction, similar to Ari��ha’s proclamation in [[MN22]] at MN I 130,5 and its
parallel [[MA200]] at T I 763b4. The remainder of [[EA50.8]] describes how the Buddha rebuffs this mistaken
belief and delivers the simile of the snake, so that this part of [[EA50.8]] is a partial parallel to [[MN22]]
Anesaki 1934b: 290 notes a reference to the present discourse under the title “discourse to Phagguna”,
, in the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā _-(_ upadeśa _-)_ śāstra, T 1509 at T XXV 60a7; cf. also Lamotte

also T 1425 at T XXII 359b14) report that the monk Bhaddāli, far from showing willing compliance, publicly refused to follow the Buddha’s injunction to eat only once a day at the very time when this injunc破群那經

146   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


MN I 125   The Kakacūpama-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama counterpart next narrate the tale of
the slave girl Kālī who successfully tested her mistress Vedehikā’s reputation for being
forbearing and gentle. [7] Both versions use the moral of this tale to explain that a monk’s
patience can be seen when he is confronted with disagreeable speech, and that a monk
should not be considered obedient if he is submissive only in order to get requisites.

MN I 126  The two versions next take up different types of speech, instructing that one should
remain unaffected by them and avoid retaliation, keeping one’s mind full of loving
kindness. [8] Cultivation of this attitude leads in both discourses to the meditative development of loving kindness as a boundless radiation in all directions, a radiation the
Madhyama-āgama version presents also with the help of the other three brahmavihāras of compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity. [9]

MN I 127   Both versions compare the unshakeable nature of this attitude to the impossibility of
trying to dig up the whole earth with a spade, of trying to paint on space, of trying to
heat up and evaporate the Ganges river with a grass torch, and of trying to cause a soft
leather bag to rustle. They differ in the sequence in which they present these images (see
table 3.1).


Table 3.1: Similes to Illustrate Patience in [[MN21]] and its Parallel

|[[MN21]]|[[MA193]]|
|---|---|
|dig up whole earth (1)<br>paint on space (2)<br>burn up Ganges (3)<br>cause soft leather bag to rustle (4)<br>simile of the saw (5)|dig up whole earth (→ 1)<br>burn up Ganges (→ 3)<br>paint on space (→ 2)<br>cause soft leather bag to rustle (→ 4)<br>simile of the saw (→ 5)|



The exposition in the Kakacūpama-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel culminates by illustrating the need for patience with the famous simile of the saw, according
to which even in the case of being cut into pieces by bandits, no aversion should arise
in one’s mind. [10]


tion appears to have been promulgated. According to [[MN70]] at MN I 474,2 and [[MA195]] at T I 749c27,
what seems to be an earlier injunction to refrain from eating at night also met with open opposition by
some monks.
6 [[MN21]] at MN I 124,18+28 and [[MA193]] at T I 744b17+20.
7 [[MN21]] at MN I 125,3 and [[MA193]] at T I 744c12.
8 [[MN21]] at MN I 126,30 and [[MA193]] at T I 745a29.
9 [[MN21]] at MN I 127,6 refers to this radiation in an abbreviated manner in terms of “having pervaded the
whole world”, sabbāvanta� loka� ... pharitvā. [[MA193]] at T I 745b6 presents the same in the more detailed way often employed in the discourses, which describes a meditative radiation applied to each of
the four directions, above and below, pervading the whole world.
10 [[MN21]] at MN I 129,15 and [[MA193]] at T I 746a13. A reference to this simile occurs, e.g., in [[MN28]] at
MN I 186,11 and its parallel [[MA30]] at T I 465a6, cf. also [[SA497]] at T II 130a23, and the *Mahāvibhā�ā,
T 1545 at T XXVII 190a28, instances indicating that it was a well-known simile in early Buddhist circles.


Chapter 3 Opamma-vagga                                   -  147


The two versions conclude by highlighting the benefit of keeping this simile in mind, MN I 129
to which the Madhyama-āgama version adds that those who regularly keep this simile
in mind will attain either full awakening or non-return. [11]


[[MN22]] Alagaddūpama-sutta

The Alagaddūpama-sutta, the “discourse on the simile of the snake”, records the monk
Ari��ha’s mistaken belief that sensuality is not an obstacle to the path. In reply to this
misunderstanding, in the Alagaddūpama-sutta the Buddha delivers the simile of the
snake, the simile of the raft, and a detailed exposition on not-self.
This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama. [12] The simile of the snake and
the simile of the raft recur as discourses on their own in the Ekottarika-āgama; [13] in addition to which parts of the discourse are also preserved in two discourse quotations in
Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya, extant in Tibetan. [14] The
introductory part of the Alagaddūpama-sutta, which narrates the monk Ari��ha’s obstinate adherence to his misunderstanding, recurs in the Vinayas of the Dharmaguptaka,
Kāśyapīya, Mahāsā�ghika, Mahīśāsaka, (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda, Sarvāstivāda, and Theravāda traditions as an exemplary case for unwillingness to give up a wrong view. [15]


11 [[MA193]] at T I 746b7.
12 The parallel is [[MA200]] at T I 763b-766b, entitled “discourse on Ari��ha”, . For remarks on
[[MA200]] cf. Minh Chau 1964/1991: 22, 114-115, 147-148, 195-196, and 201. [[MA200]] agrees with [[MN22]] and the two partial parallels from the Ekottarika-āgama in locating the discourse in Jeta’s Grove by
Sāvatthī. Lévi 1915: 421 notes that the Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, T 1435 at T XXIII 174b21, refers to the
present discourse as, a transcription the same text explains to intend the “discourse on
the simile of the snake”, . Thus the Sarvāstivāda Vinaya agrees with [[MN22]] on the title of the
discourse, thereby disagreeing with [[MA200]] in this respect. A reference to the present discourse in the
*Mahāprajñāpāramitā-(upadeśa-)śāstra, T 1509 at T XXV 63c7, speaks of the “discourse on the simile
of the raft”,, reconstructed by Lamotte 1944/1981: 64 as Kolopamasūtra; cf. also the slightly
different title given in the *Mahāvibhā�ā, T 1545 at T XXVII 503b20: “Dharma exposition on the simile
of the raft”, 阿梨吒經
13 The simile of the raft occurs in [[EA43.5]] at T II 759c-760b, which is thus a partial parallel to [[MN22]] Another partial parallel is [[EA50.8]] at T II 812c-813b. While the beginning part of [[EA50.8]] parallels [[MN21]] its remainder parallels [[MN22]] as it records the Buddha’s examination of the mistaken view on sensuality and his delivery of the simile of the snake. 阿羅伽度波摩

15 These are the background narrations to the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya pātayantika rule 68, T 1428 at T
XXII 682a9, Kāśyapīya Vinaya rule 55, T 1460 at T XXIV 663a9 (although this is the Prātimok�a-sūtra
of this tradition and usually only lists the rules, in the present case it gives a short account of what hap- 栰喻經
pened), Mahāsā�ghika Vinaya rule 45, T 1425 at T XXII 367a3, Mahīśāsaka Vinaya rule 48, T 1421 at
T XXII 56c12 筏喻法門., (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya rule 55, T 1442 at T XXIII 840b20, cf. also Dutt 1984c: 30,2
and Yamagiwa 2001: 86,7, Sarvāstivāda Vinaya rule 55, T 1435 at T XXIII 106a3, and Theravāda Vinaya rule 68 at Vin IV 133,32 (with a minor difference compared to the account in [[MN22]] noted by
Horner 1942/1983: 23 note 8), cf. also Vin II 25,10. Von Hinüber 1999a: 70 suggests that the Theravāda
Vinaya account of events stems from [[MN22]] in line with a general tendency of narrative Vinaya material to derive from the Suttapi�aka (with occasional exceptions, cf. von Hinüber 1996/1997: 13). [[AN148]]   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


MN I 130  The Alagaddūpama-sutta and its parallel in the Madhyama-āgama report in similar
terms that the monk Ari��ha, although contradicted by other monks, obstinately adhered
to his belief that to indulge in sensuality should not be considered an obstruction. The
Pāli commentary and the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya explain that he had mistaken the ability
of lay people to reach stream-entry, once-return, and non-return to imply that indulgence in sensuality does not really hinder one’s progress on the path. [16]
The Alagaddūpama-sutta and its parallel agree that the Buddha rebuked Ari��ha for
this misunderstanding and consequent misrepresentation of the teaching. A minor difference is that according to the Majjhima-nikāya version the monks had attempted to
convince Ari��ha of the falseness of his belief with the help of ten similes illustrative of
the dangers in sensual pleasures, while the Madhyama-āgama account records only
eight similes (see table 3.2). [17] Another difference is that in the Majjhima-nikāya dis

Ari��ha recurs in [[SN54.6]] at SN V 315,3, where he describes his practice of mindfulness of breathing
based on abandoning sensual desires in regard to past and future, an abandoning that according to the
commentarial explanation at Spk III 264,2 should be understood to refer to his attainment of non-return.
The Chinese version of his statement in [[SA805]] at T II 206c3 differs slightly, as instead of referring to
abandoning sensual desires, in this version he explains that he develops mindfulness of breathing without worrying about the past, yearning for the future, or being attached to the present. In spite of a different formulation, this also portrays an advanced stage of practice. A layman Ari��ha occurs also in [[AN6.120]] at AN III 451,16 in a list of lay stream-enterers. Since [[SN54.6]] and [[AN6.120]] simply speak of
Ari��ha, whereas the Vinaya passages and [[MN22]] speak of Ari��ha gaddhabādhipubba (on this term cf.
Shih 2000: 75 note 103), of whom Vin II 27,26 reports that he eventually decided to disrobe, these accounts seem to involve different persons. One of these would be the Ari��ha whose dogmatic clinging to
his mistaken view caused the Vinaya regulations and the delivery of [[MN22]] The other could be the layman and stream-entrant Ari��ha who eventually entered the order and, as a monk, described his practice
of mindfulness of breathing.
16 Ps II 103,3 and T 1421 at T XXII 56c16; cf. also Keown 1992/2001: 97.
17 Another difference is that, according to [[MA200]] at T I 763c17, the monks came out with the similes only
when asked by the Buddha about their understanding of his position on sensual pleasures, while in [[MN22]] at MN I 130,25 they did the same already earlier, when trying on their own to convince Ari��ha of the
falseness of his belief. The two similes not found in [[MA200]] are the slaughterhouse and the sword stake,
[[MN22]] at MN I 130,28: asisūnūpamā ... sattisūlūpamā. The list of ten similes found in [[MN22]] recurs in
[[AN10.40]] at AN III 97,2, Thī 488-491, Jā V 210,8, and in the two Pāli Vinaya passages that report the
Ari��ha incident at Vin II 25,31 and Vin IV 134,20. Seven out of the eight similes shared by [[MN22]] and
[[MA200]] recur with detailed explanations in [[MN54]] at MN I 364,12 and in its parallel [[MA203]] at T I
774a20; cf. also below p. 315 note 29. The eighth simile shared by [[MN22]] and [[MA200]] the simile of
the snake, recurs on its own in [[SN35.1]] at [[SNP768]] and in [[MA203]] at T I 774b29. The two similes not found
in [[MA200]] recur elsewhere in the Pāli discourses: the slaughterhouse in [[MN23]] at MN I 144,31 and the
sword stake in [[SN45.1]] at SN I 128,25 (or SN [2] 162 at SN [2] I 282,10), in Thī 58, and in Thī 141. Of the
other Vinayas treating the Ari��ha case, the Dharmaguptaka and the Mahīśāsaka Vinayas also list similes. The Dharmaguptaka Vinaya in T 1428 at T XXII 682a23 has twelve similes, which seem to incorporate the ten similes found in [[MN22]] The Mahīśāsaka Vinaya in T 1421 at T XXII 56c23 (to be supplemented by T XXII 3b17) has only eight similes, some of which are not found in [[MN22]] and [[MA200]]
The similes shared by these two discourses and the three Vinaya accounts are the bones, the dream, and
the snake. Several of the images found in [[MN22]] recur also in other listings of similes illustrative of
sensual pleasures, e.g., SĀ [2] 185 at T II 440a5 has the image of the bones, the piece of meat, the torch


Chapter 3 Opamma-vagga                                   -  149


course the Buddha clarifies that it is impossible to engage in sensual pleasures without
having sensual desires, a statement not recorded in the Madhyama-āgama version. [18]


Table 3.2: Similes on the Dangers of Sensual Pleasures in [[MN22]] and [[MA200]]

|[[MN22]]|[[MA200]]|
|---|---|
|skeleton (1)<br>piece of meat (2)<br>torch (3)<br>pit of burning coals (4)<br>dream (5)<br>borrowed goods (6)<br>fruit tree (7)<br>slaughterhouse (8)<br>sword stake (9)<br>snake’s head (10)|skeleton (→ 1)<br>piece of meat (→ 2)<br>torch (→ 3)<br>fiery pit (→ 4)<br>poisonous snake (→ 10)<br>dream (→ 5)<br>borrowed goods (→ 6)<br>fruit tree (→ 7)<br> <br>(≠ 8-9)|



The Alagaddūpama-sutta and its Chinese parallels turn to the case of someone who
learns the Dharma but does not make an effort to understand it properly. While the
Majjhima-nikāya version considers this case by listing the nine a�gas, [19] the Madhyama-āgama discourse and the partial parallel found in the Ekottarika-āgama list twelve
types. [20] These listings seem to present different textual types recognized at a comparatively early stage in the history of Buddhist literature. [21] While the original meaning of


held against the wind, the coal pit, the dream, the borrowed goods, the tree fruit, and the sword; [[EA16.1]]
at T II 578b21 has the motif of the bones, the piece of meat, and the borrowed goods; [[EA46.10]] at T II
780b12 has the snake and the bones, etc.; T 203.96 at T IV 486c13, translated in Willemen 1994: 195196, has the bones, the piece of meat, the torch held against the wind, and the borrowed goods; the Śrāvakabhūmi has a listing that covers the skeleton, the piece of meat, the torch, the pit, the snake, the
dream, the borrowed goods, and the tree fruit, cf. Deleanu 2006a: 320,8 or Shukla 1973: 440,17 and T
1579 at T XXX 465c25.
18 [[MN22]] at MN I 133,21.
19 [[MN22]] at MN I 133,24.
20 [[MA200]] at T I 764a14 and [[EA50.8]] at T II 813a16. Lamotte 1956: 263 note 2 explains that the twelvefold presentation prevails in the Chinese Āgamas, in the different Vinayas (except for the Mahāsā�ghika
Vinaya), in the main treatises of the Sarvāstivāda, Sautrāntika, Vaibhā�ika, and Yogācāra schools, and
in most Mahāyāna sūtras (for a detailed survey cf. the table in Mayeda 1964; for a discussion of occurrences of the twelve-fold listing in Chinese texts cf. Nattier 2004). Hirakawa 1963: 63 points out that the
occurrence of the twelve-fold listing in the Ekottarika-āgama does not fit too well with the hypothesis
that attributes this collection to a Mahāsā�ghika tradition, as the Mahāsā�ghika Vinaya employs the
nine-fold listing, cf. T 1425 at T XXII 227b12, summed up at T XXII 227b25 [[BU-AS21]] While the commentarial tradition takes these nine to represent actual collections, according to Kalupahana 1965: 616 “this classification of the buddhavacana is a mere description of literary types ... it does
not refer to nine different groups of literature, but to nine types of composition”; cf. also, e.g., Dutt 1957:
89: “the list [of a�gas]... rests on an analysis of different forms of composition found in the canon”, and
Ñā�atiloka 1952/1988: 193 s.v. sāsana, who concludes that the a�ga system “is a classification according to literary styles, and not according to given texts”; cf. also below p. 697 and p. 866 note 49.

MN I 133


150   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


the terminology employed in this passage in the Alagaddūpama-sutta is uncertain, the
Pāli commentary offers the following explanations:

 - sutta refers to discourses spoken by the Buddha in general, [22]

 - geyya stands for discourses with verses, [23]

 - veyyākara�a designates explanatory discourses without verse, [24]

 - gāthā are verses, such as found in the Dhammapada, the Thera- and Therīgāthā,
and in parts of the Sutta-nipāta,

 - udāna as an inspired utterance in a wider sense refers to discourses that combine
prose with such an utterance, a typical example being the discourses found now
in the Udāna of the Khuddaka-nikāya,

 - itivuttaka stands for discourses that begin with the introductory “thus it was said”,
vutta� ... iti, as is the case for the discourses found now in the Itivuttaka, [25]


22 Ps II 106,8 includes also the Vinaya (the two Vinayavibha�gas, the Khandhaka, and the (rather late) Parivāra) under the heading of sutta, together with the following discourses from the Sutta-nipāta: Ma�gala-sutta, Ratana-sutta, Nālaka-sutta, and Tuva�aka-sutta. Von Hinüber 1994a: 127 notes that in the
discourses the term used to refer to a particular discourse is usually veyyākara�a or dhammapariyāya,
instead of sutta. He suggests (p. 129) that in the listing of a�gas the term sutta could rather stand for the
Pātimokkha-sutta. Kalupahana 1965: 616 comments that “the explanation of sutta (sūtra) given by the
Sanskrit schools of Buddhism seems to preserve the original sense denoted by the term. According to
them, it denotes the word of the Buddha in prose (gadhyabhā�ita) which could be easily understood by
the listeners”. According to Przyluski 1926: 341, the use of the expression sutta in the present context
has the more specific sense of an exposition that begins with an enumeration of a particular item (e.g.,
“there are four things ... what are the four”, etc.), thereby retaining the original sense of sutta as “thread”
or “string”. Ñā�aponika 1977: 13 explains that sutta in its Buddhist usage refers to a presentation of the
Dharma that is internally connected by a thread, as it were (“eine zusammenhängende Lehrdarstellung
... durch die sich ein gemeinsamer Faden hindurchzieht”). The idea of a “thread” or a “string” underlies
[[DHP|DHP44-45]] which compares a well-taught dhammapada to a skilled florist who strings up flowers. The
same idea can be found more explicitly in Vin III 9,10, which compares the nine-fold teachings of former Buddhas (i.e. the sutta, geyya, etc., delivered by them) to flowers strung on a string; cf. also Winternitz 1908: 229. Norman 1997: 104, however, derives sutta from su + ukta, “well spoken”; cf. also Gombrich 1990b: 23, Thomas 1933/2004: 269 note 2, Vetter 1988: viii, Walleser 1914: 4 note 1, and Wright
1966: 7 note 2, whereas Mayrhofer 1976: 492 and von Hinüber 1994a: 132 note 28 (after surveying the
aforesaid publications) consider that such a derivation is not required to explain the term; cf. also
Bronkhorst 2009: xi note 4 and Klaus 2010.
23 Jayawickrama 1959: 12 explains that “geyya (from √gai gāyati, to sing), seems to represent the ākhyāna-type containing stanzas punctuated with narrative prose. Generally, in the old ākhyānas, the stanzas
alone had a fixed form while the prose-narrative was given by the reciter in his own words”. According
to Mayeda 1964: 24, geyya “is not, however, a simple juxtaposition of prose and verse. The prose section which comes first is repeated once again in the verse section which follows. This repetition of similar contents is the key point of geyya”; cf. also Burnouf 1844/1876: 47.
24 Ps II 106,13 also includes discourses that have not been covered by the other eight types of text and the
Abhidhammapi�aka under this heading, an obvious anachronism. Von Hinüber 1994a: 126 points out
that in canonical usage the expression veyyākara�a appears to be applicable to any type of discourse; cf.
also Anālayo 2009l.
25 [[MA200]] at T I 764a15 renders Itivuttaka as and [[EA50.8]] at T II 813a17 simply as . Bapat 1969:
3 explains that the translation found in the Madhyama-āgama indicates that the translator did not follow

 - jātakas are records of former lives of the Buddha,

 - abbhutadhamma describe marvellous events or qualities, [26]

 - vedalla refers to discourses that proceed in the form of a question and answer exchange. [27]
The three additional categories included in the twelve-fold listing are:

 - nidāna, historical narratives, such as the introduction to a discourse, which specifies the discourse’s setting and circumstances,

 - apadāna, mostly narrations of former lives of disciples that illustrate the working
mechanism of karma, [28]

 - upadesa, perhaps best understood to refer to philosophical instructions and expositions. [29]


the “Sanskritisation ... to v�ttaka”, found, e.g., in the Mahāvyutpatti no. 1274 in Sakaki 1926: 97 as Itiv�ttaka, with its corresponding Chinese renderings as or and its Tibetan rendering as de
lta bu byung ba’i sde; or in the Abhidharmasamuccaya, Pradhan 1950: 78,3: itiv�ttaka�, where the Chinese version T 1606 at T XXXI 743b9 also uses (as already noted by Hazra 1994: 146, this is then
taken to refer to past life experiences of disciples, cf. also the Śrāvakabhūmi, Shukla 1973: 138,9 or ŚSG
1998: 230,10 and T 1579 at T XXX 418c19); cf. also Ruegg 1999: 201-202. Bapat takes this as one of
several arguments in support of the hypothesis that the Madhyama-āgama was translated from a Prākrit
original.
26 Ps II 106,22 mentions the marvellous qualities of Ānanda, listed in [[DN16]] at DN II 145,3 and [[AN4.129]]
at AN II 132,17, as an example of this category. Another example would be the Acchariya-abbhūta-sutta, [[MN123]] at MN III 118-124, which is mentioned as an instance of the present category in a listing of
a�gas in T 212 at T IV 643c10: 本事 此說他事 ; cf. also the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā _-_

27 Ps II 106,26 lists as examples the Sakkapañha-sutta, [[DN21]] at DN II 263-289, the Sammādi��hi-sutta,
[[MN9]] at MN I 46-55, the Mahāvedalla-sutta, [[MN43]] at MN I 292-298, the Cū�avedalla-sutta, [[MN44]] at
MN I 299-305, the Mahāpu��ama-sutta, [[MN109]] at MN III 15-20, and the Sa�khārabhājaniya-sutta (=
Sa�khāruppatti-sutta), [[MN120]] at MN III 99-103. Dhammajoti 2005: 112 suggests that the fact that vedalla is listed last “could be an indication that vedalla came to be incorporated into the classificatory
scheme at a relatively later stage”, so that this category could represent an evolving Abhidhammic approach (cf. also, however, below p. 699 note 70). Regarding the significance of the term, according to 若尊者阿難以未曾有法歎如來德
Jayawickrama 1959: 14 the word vedalla “comes from an older vaidārya form, vi + √d� to tear apart,
hence analyse or break down into fundamentals”, wherefore he concludes that vedalla probably means
“subtle analysis”. Kalupahana 1965: 618 similarly takes vedalla to refer in particular to “subtle analyses,
unintelligible to the ordinary man”. Ñā�apo�ika in Ñā�atiloka 1907/1984: 204 note 16-9 relates vedalla
to √dal and speaks of discourses of an explanatory character, “Sutten von erläuterndem Charakter”. Cf.
also [[AN10.44]] at AN III 107,4, which lists vedallakathā together with abhidhammakathā.
28 Instances of this type of texts in the Pāli tradition would be the Mahāpadāna-sutta, [[DN14]] at DN II 154, and the texts containing narrations of the former lives of monks and nuns, collected in the Apadāna
of the Khuddhaka-nikāya; on the Apadāna collection cf. also, e.g., Appleton 2010: 3-5, Barua 1946,

152       - A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikàya_


After listing these _aïga_ s, the _Alagaddåpama-sutta_ and its parallels continue by comparing wrong grasp of the Dharma to taking hold of a snake by its tail and consequently getting bitten, while proper grasp of the Dharma compares to skilfully catching
a snake without getting bitten.

MN I 134   The _Majjhima-nikàya_ and _Madhyama-àgama_ versions continue with the famous par
able of the raft, a parable also found in the other partial parallel from the _Ekottarika-_
_àgama_ and in an extract from a version of the present discourse preserved in øamathadeva's commentary on the _Abhidharmako÷abhàùya_ . [30] The four versions agree in describing how someone constructs a raft in order to cross over a stretch of water. After
successfully crossing over, the raft should be left behind, instead of being taken along.
Similarly, the monks should leave (attachment to) the teachings behind, not to speak of
leaving behind what is contrary to the teachings. [31]

Further information on this image can be gathered from a _Saüyutta-nikàya_ discourse
and its parallel in the _Saüyukta-àgama_, which similarly describe crossing a water expanse with the help of a raft in order to reach the other shore. In these two discourses,
the raft stands for the noble eightfold path and the other shore represents Nirvàõa. [32]

The commentary to the _Alagaddåpama-sutta_ explains the injunction to leave the
teachings behind with the help of a passage from the _Mahàtaõhàsaïkhaya-sutta_, in
which the Buddha refers to the raft simile when instructing the monks on the need to
steer clear of any attachment to their own view, however pure it may be. [33] The same
commentary also brings up the _Lañukikopama-sutta_, which highlights the importance
of abandoning a lower level of concentration in order to be able to reach a higher level
of concentration, in this way progressing on the path of mental development. [34] In sum,
then, the injunction to leave the teachings behind appears to point to detachment. The
same injunction would not imply discarding the path itself, however, as this would
amount to discarding the very means that is to be used for developing detachment. [35]

the former and fully discarded the latter”. Carrithers 1983a: 73 explains the simile to intend that “it is ir _-_

The Alagaddūpama-sutta next examines six standpoints for views. Regarding these MN I 135
standpoints, the Majjhima-nikāya version differentiates between the unlearned worldling’s tendency of falling prey to identifications and the noble disciple, who is free
from such identifications. [36] The Madhyama-āgama version makes a similar point, differing in as much as it directly proceeds to the noble disciple, without taking up the
case of an unlearned worldling. [37] The Alagaddūpama-sutta applies this treatment to:

 - body,

 - feeling,

 - perception,

 - mental formations,

 - what is experienced and thought,

 - the belief in the permanent existence of the self and the world. [38]
The Madhyama-āgama version differs from this presentation in as much as it does
not mention mental formations (sa�khāra). Instead, the Madhyama-āgama version lists
what appears to be an annihilationist viewpoint. [39] In a recapitulation of these six stand
the profitable practices are now second nature to the monk”. Kalupahana 1988: 302 notes that “the usefulness of the raft is contextual and concrete. Apart from the context, the raft has no meaning, and it is
not possessed of absolute value”. For a detailed discussion of the significance of the present passage cf.
Keown 1992/2001: 92-105.
36 In relation to the sixth of these views, [[MN22]] at MN I 135,36 actually speaks of taking the (eternalist)
standpoint for views itself to be mine, I, or my self, di��hi��hāna� ... tam pi eta� mama eso ’ham asmi,
eso me attā ti samanupassati. Although a standpoint for views, di��hi��hāna, can be appropriated as
“mine”, it seems difficult to conceive of it as being taken to be “I” or “my self”. Perhaps the injunction
should be understood to refer to the content of the view, not to the viewpoint itself.
37 The passage in [[MA200]] at T I 764c15 begins with, “and again” (corresponding to puna ca para�
in Pāli). Such a conjunction is not required at this point, since the discourse is broaching a new subject,
the six standpoints for views. The occurrence of this conjunction at the outset of the present passage
suggests the possibility that an exposition of the unlearned worldling formed part of the original account
and was lost during the process of transmission.
38 [[MN22]] at MN I 135,27. Norman 1981: 20 notes that the sixth view echoes the identification of the self
with the world proposed in Chāndogya Upani�ad 3.14.4; Bhattacharya 1997: 25 relates the same view
to a passage in the Śatapatha Brāhma�a (10.6.3); cf. also, however, Bronkhorst 2007: 216. Regarding
the fifth view on identifying with what is seen, heard, etc., Gombrich 1990a: 15 draws attention to
B�hadāra�yaka Upani�ad 4.5.6, according to which the same activities should be recognized as manifestations of the self; cf. also Gombrich 2002/2003, Hosoda 2002/2003: 483, and Jayatilleke 1963/ 復次
1980: 60. In relation to the catechism in [[MN22]] at MN I 138,11, Norman 1981: 22 remarks that the answers given by the monks “can only be given by those who know, in advance, that the term attā is by
definition nicca and sukha, and therefore anything which is anicca and dukkha cannot be attā ... the
Buddha’s audience were aware of the Upani�adic view and realised that it could be refuted simply by
pointing out that the world around us ... is obviously non-eternal and dukkha”.
39 [[MA200]] at T I 764c19: “[there is] nothing that I possess, I am not possessed by another, I will not be and
I will not possess [anything]”, . A similar formulation, coming at
the end of a comparable progression of ideas, can be found in [[SA133]] at T II 42a8; cf. also [[SA136]] at T
II 42b26 and [[SA139]] at T II 43a7. A proposition of a comparable type, although without being presented
as an object for contemplation of not-self, occurs in [[SN22.81]] at SN III 99,4, [[SN22.153]] at SN III 183,26,
[[SN24.4]] at SN III 206,17, and [[AN10.29]] at AN V 63,28. Bodhi 2000: 1060 note 75 explains that such

points for views, the Madhyama-āgama version does mention mental formations,
thereby corresponding more closely to the Majjhima-nikāya version of the six standpoints for views. [40]

MN I 136   The Alagaddūpama-sutta and its parallel in the Madhyama-āgama describe in similar
terms the agitation experienced by those who long for things from the past, and the
agitation experienced by those who believe in an eternal self and who, on hearing the
Buddha’s teaching, come to the conclusion that they will be annihilated. The two versions differ, however, in the way they introduce these two cases. Thus longing for the
past is because of:

      - what does not exist externally (according to the Pāli version),

      - what does exist internally (according to the Chinese version).
Fear of annihilation arises because of:

      - what does not exist internally (according to the Pāli version), [41]

      - what does exist externally (according to the Chinese version). [42]
The Pāli presentation uses “external” to refer to things one had in the past and has no
longer, [43] while “internal” refers to the non-existent self. The Chinese version, however,
seems to use the same two expressions to refer to the source for the agitation, as what
exists “internally” stands for the person’s own mental reflections, while what exists
“externally” represents hearing the Buddha’s teaching on not-self. Thus the Majjhimanikāya version highlights the objects of the agitation – past possessions or a supposed
self – while the Madhyama-āgama version places emphasis on the source of the mental
agitation, which is either hearing or else thinking.


propositions occur in two modes, one used by annihilationists and framed in terms of “I” (e.g., “if I were
not”, no c’ assa�), while the Buddhist adoption of this proposition is framed in terms of “it” (e.g., “if it
were not”, no c’ assa), found, e.g., in [[MN106]] at MN II 264,20, [[SN22.55]] at SN III 55,29, and [[AN7.52]]
at AN IV 70,8. This shows that the annihilationist view bears a relation to contemplation of not-self, in
that the annihilationist’s position needs to be dissociated from a sense of “I”. On this interpretation, the
reference in [[MA200]] would become more easily understandable. However, the first part of the same formulation recurs in [[MA200]] at T I 765c7 as an instruction by the Buddha to the monks on contemplating
not-self: . Since this passage also employs the personal
pronoun “I”,, it seems improbable that the earlier instance at T I 764c17 should be interpreted as intending a shift from a statement framed with the personal pronoun “I” to one that dispenses with it. On
this type of contemplation cf. also de La Vallée Poussin 1931. Ps II 112,18, in its gloss on the present
passage, quotes the statement no c’ assa� no ca me siyā (from [[SN22.55]] at SN III 57,28, which would
correspond to part of the statement found in [[MA200]] at T I 764c19), explaining how an eternalist would
be agitated on hearing the Buddha’s teaching and believing it to imply annihilation.
40 [[MA200]] at T I 765c9, although this is followed by another reference to the view of annihilationism.
Moreover, the Chinese character for mental formations,, occurs out of sequence, as it is found between feeling and perception.

The Alagaddūpama-sutta and its parallel continue with the Buddha somewhat hu- MN I 137
morously inviting the monks to grasp or rely on what, if grasped or relied on, is not impermanent and will not lead to sorrow. [44] The two versions differ, however, on the possibilities they list for such grasping. The Pāli discourse proposes:

 - a permanent acquisition (pariggaha),

 - grasping a doctrine of a self that does not lead to sorrow,

 - relying on a view that does not lead to sorrow. [45]
The Chinese discourse lists:

 - an acquisition that does not lead to sorrow,

 - relying on a view that does not lead to sorrow,

 - grasping a body that is beyond change and alteration. [46]
In spite of such differences, [47] the Alagaddūpama-sutta and its parallel can be seen to
agree that attachment will inevitably lead to sorrow, whether such attachment is to any
type of acquisition, including the body, or to any view, including a doctrine of a self.
The Pāli version continues with a question and answer catechism on the impermanent, MN I 138
unsatisfactory, and not-self nature of the five aggregates, instructing that any instance
of each aggregate should be contemplated as “not I, not mine, not my self”. [48] The Chinese version applies a similar catechism to the six standpoints for views. [49] The two
discourses agree that the successful undertaking of such contemplation of not-self can
lead to full awakening.
The Alagaddūpama-sutta and its parallel next describe a monk who has reached full MN I 139
awakening with a set of five epithets, according to which such a monk has overcome:

 - ignorance,

 - the round of rebirths,

 - craving,

 - the five lower fetters, [50]

 - the conceit ‘I am’. [51]

44 Abhidh-k-� at D (4094) mngon pa, nyu 94b5 or Q (5595) thu 143a8 parallels the discussion on not-self
that begins in [[MN22]] at MN I 137,24; cf. also the discourse quotation in Abhidh-k 9 in Pradhan 1967:

45 [[MN22]] at MN I 137,17.
46 [[MA200]] at T I 765b15.
47 Another difference between the two versions is that [[MN22]] at MN I 138,9 qualifies the view that affirms
a permanent self as a completely and utterly foolish teaching, kevalo paripūro bāladhammo, a remark
absent from [[MA200]]
48 [[MN22]] at MN I 138,10.

pa, nyu 94b7 or Q (5595) thu 143b4 differs from [[MA200]] in so far as it takes up form, feelings, perceptions and what is seen, heard, cognized, etc., without bringing in formations or either an annihilationist
or eternalist view.
50 Overcoming the five lower fetters is already achieved with non-return. Hence, on its own, this particular
epithet would not yet mark off someone as being fully awakened.


156   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


The two versions agree that even gods will be unable to find the support of the consciousness of such a monk. [52]

MN I 140 The Alagaddūpama-sutta and its parallel continue by turning to Brahmins and recluses who mistake the Buddha’s teaching for annihilation. The Pāli version clarifies
that the Buddha’s teaching is only concerned with dukkha and its cessation, a statement
not found in the Chinese parallel. [53]
The two discourses continue with the Buddha’s equanimous attitude when being
either reviled or venerated. According to the Majjhima-nikāya version, when venerated
the Buddha would reflect that such honour was towards what had “previously been
fully understood”. [54]
The commentary explains this somewhat cryptic statement to imply that when honour and veneration occurred, the Buddha did not have the slightest notion of thinking
“I am being honoured, I am being venerated”, but was clearly aware that such honour
was only directed to the five aggregates. According to the commentary, the expression
“previously fully understood” refers to the five aggregates, because with his awakening
the Buddha had fully understood them. [55]
The Madhyama-āgama parallel differs in as much as it reports that, when being venerated, the Buddha would reflect that this was due to his present knowledge and elimination [of defilements]. [56]
The Madhyama-āgama version also reports the Buddha’s reflection when being reviled. According to its account, in such a case the Buddha would reflect that his present
experience of being reviled was simply a result of his own deeds of the past. [57]


51 [[MN22]] at MN I 139,16 and [[MA200]] at T I 765c22. These five epithets recur with an explanation in [[AN10.33]] at AN III 84,13.
52 Both versions refer to such a liberated monk as a tathāgata/, [[MN22]] at MN I 140,5 and [[MA200]] at
T I 766a7. Trenckner 1888/1993: 542 comments that in the present context the term “retains the original
sense of ‘such a one’ ... and the other significations of tathāgata may have proceeded from texts like
these”.
53 [[MN22]] at MN I 140,14: dukkhañ c’ eva paññāpemi, dukkhassa ca nirodha�. The same statement recurs
in [[SN22.86]] at SN III 119,5 and [[SN44.2]] at SN IV 384,14, but is absent from their Chinese parallel [[SA106]] at T II 33a4.
54 [[MN22]] at MN I 140,23: ya� kho ida� pubbe pariññāta� tattha me evarūpā kārā karīyantī ti.
55 Ps II 118,32 quotes the Buddha’s statement as reading: tattha ’me (= tattha + ime, with ime representing
the five aggregates). An argument against this would be that according to the rules of sandhi (cf. Fahs
1989: 39 and Warder 1963/1991: 214) one would expect tattha + ime 如來 to result in tatth’ ime rather than
in tattha ’me. Horner 1954/1967: 180 note 10 points out that the commentarial interpretation “must be
wrong, for just below when the monks are being told to comport themselves, we get tattha no”. That is,
the reading tattha no indicates that the Buddha’s statement would analogously be tattha me, so that both
reflections are formulated in terms of “to me” (me) or “to us” (no) such honour and veneration are being
done, not in terms of being done “to these [aggregates]”. Horner’s argument holds for the PTS and Siamese editions, S [e] -MN I 279,11, which read tattha no, while B [e] -MN I 193,23 reads tattha ’me (in accordance with the commentarial gloss) and C [e] -MN I 350,25 reads tatr’ ime.

Chapter 3 Opamma-vagga                                   -  157


Since a reflection in case of being reviled is not found at all in the Majjhima-nikāya
version, its description of how the Buddha would react to honour and praise by reflecting on what had “previously been fully understood” might be a conflation of what originally could have been two reflections, one on what had “previously been done” and the
other on what “at present is fully understood”, the former appropriate for the case of
blame and the latter for the case of praise, as in the Madhyama-āgama version.
In both discourses, the Buddha tells the monks that they should likewise develop
equanimity in regard to praise and blame. To illustrate the attitude they should develop,
the two versions give the example of how someone might carry away the dry grass and
twigs in Jeta’s Grove and burn them. [58] The Alagaddūpama-sutta stands alone in preceding the simile of the grass and twigs with an instruction to the monks, according to
which they should give up the five aggregates, since none of these five aggregates
really belongs to them. [59]
Another difference between the two versions is that, according to the Pāli report, the
Buddha questioned the monks if, on seeing grass and twigs carried away and being
burnt, they would think “we are being carried away and burnt”. [60] According to the Chinese version of the simile, however, the Buddha asked the monks if the grass and twigs
would have such a thought. [61] That is, in the Chinese discourse the point made with the
simile is that just as dry grass and twigs do not have such thoughts, so too the monks
should not have thoughts of “I” and “mine” when confronted with praise and blame.
Thus, whereas according to the Majjhima-nikāya version the monks should have the
same attitude towards themselves as towards grass and twigs in a grove, [62] according to
the Madhyama-āgama version they should avoid reacting, just as dry grass and twigs
do not react to whatever is done to them.
The Madhyama-āgama version’s presentation of the simile brings to mind the Mahārāhulovāda-sutta, where the Buddha somewhat similarly instructs Rāhula to develop a
mind like the earth, which is not disgusted or humiliated when people spit on it or
throw dirt on it. [63]
The Alagaddūpama-sutta’s version of this simile receives support from a discourse
in the Sa�yutta-nikāya and its Chinese and Gāndhārī parallels, which present the sim

karotī ti (C [e] -MN I 352,6 and S [e] -MN I 280,3: �ahati, C [e] also does not have the last vā)? Wynne 2010:
210 explains that this simile “is clearly a reductio ad absurdum of the Upani�adic concept of a world
self”, in the sense that “if the grass, stick and so on in the Jetavana are not part of oneself, then the Upani�adic notion of personal identity with a world self is foolish”.
61 [[MA200]] at T I 766a29: ?
62 Ñā�aponika 1962/1974: 10 explains the simile to imply that “if viewed in the single-minded and passion-free detachment of Insight-meditation (vipassanā), these physical and mental processes, so long regarded as ‘I’ and ‘Mine’, will be seen to be as alien as the vegetation of the Jeta Grove”.

ile of the leaves and twigs in terms of the monks having the thought “we are being carried away” or “what belongs to us is being carried away”. [64]
The same idea also underlies a stanza in the Theragāthā where the novice Adhimutta,
who according to the commentarial account was about to be killed by bandits, explains
that he is without fear since he considers the whole world as if it were mere grass and
twigs. [65] The point made in this way corresponds to the Alagaddūpama-sutta’s version
of the simile, in the sense that Adhimutta indicates to have as little attachment to himself as he would have towards dry grass and twigs.

MN I 141  The Alagaddūpama-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel agree in highlighting that
in the Buddha’s teaching the four stages of awakening can be found, and that those
who have faith in the Buddha will be heading for a good rebirth. [66] The Pāli version
stands alone in also referring to the Dharma-follower (dhammānusārī) and the faithfollower (saddhānusārī). [67]


[[MN23]] Vammika-sutta

The Vammika-sutta, [68] the “discourse on the termite mound”, presents a simile about a
termite hill, [69] followed by recording the Buddha’s explanation of this simile. This discourse has four Chinese parallels, two of which can be found in two Sa�yukta-āgama
translations, another parallel occurs in the Ekottarika-āgama, and the fourth parallel is an
individual translation. [70]

Senior Kharo��hī fragment 5 lines 18-19, and two Chinese parallels, [[SA269]] at T II 70b6 and [[SA274]] at
T II 73a6. These four discourses also record the Buddha’s instruction: “give up what is not yours”, which
[[SN22.33]] the Gāndhārī discourse fragment, and [[SA269]] apply to the five aggregates, while [[SA274]]
applies the same instruction to the six senses.

66 Cruise 1983: 159 notes that in the Pāli version “monks are mentioned in all but the last group”, i.e. those
who have faith and are thus destined to a good rebirth (in [[MA200]] however, the expression “monk”,
, is not used in the description of any group). Norman 1991/1993b: 184 relates the present passage
to a similar prospect to be expected for a devoted Jain disciple. Upadhyaya 1980: 352 sees the prediction in [[MN22]] on the potential of faith as one of the germs for a development that eventually changed an
“atheistic doctrine of wisdom and self-reliance into a theistic religion of devotion and grace”; on this passage cf. also Ludowyk-Gyomroi 1947: 32. Yet, as noted by de La Vallée Poussin 1927/2001: 233, elsewhere in the Pāli discourses similar statements can be found, such as the promise that those who take refuge in the Buddha will be reborn in heaven, cf., e.g., [[DN20]] at DN II 255,3 and [[SN1.37]] at SN I 27,8
(or SN [2] 37 at SN [2] I 57,3) or the statement that the inspiration caused by visiting the stūpa of a Buddha
has the same effect of ensuring a good rebirth, cf. [[DN16]] at DN II 142,21.

The Vammika-sutta and its Āgama parallels begin by reporting that a deva, who had MN I 142
come to visit the monk Kumāra Kassapa, [71] described a termite mound that smokes by
night and burns by day, and which when dug into reveals a series of items. [72] Each of
these items needs to be taken out, [73] until finally a nāga will come to light. According to
all versions, the deva told Kumāra Kassapa that he should approach the Buddha in order
to get this simile explained.
The five versions of the discourse agree that, according to the explanation given by MN I 144
the Buddha, the termite mound represents a person’s body. [74] Due to thinking and planning, the termite mound “smokes” by night, and due to carrying out actions, it “burns”
by day. In a discourse in the A�guttara-nikāya, these expressions represent imaginings
based on the notion ‘I am’. [75]
Energetically digging with the “knife” of wisdom into this “termite mound”, the noble
disciple will unearth and discard a series of items. The Pāli and Chinese versions vary
on the nature of the items unearthed in this way. [76] They agree, however, that the unearthing and discarding of these items represents the overcoming of ignorance, anger,
doubt, and of the five types of sensual pleasure (see table 3.3).
The Pāli version stands alone in considering the five aggregates of clinging as an
item to be “unearthed” and discarded. [77] When evaluating this difference, it is noteworthy that the other items mentioned in the Vammika-sutta are all unwholesome mental

title “discourse spoken by the Buddha on the simile of the ant”, . Anesaki 1908: 117 gives
the title for [[SA1079]] which he translates as “digging out”. The summary verse at T II 735b12 refers to [[EA39.9]] as, with a,, and variant reading as . A study of the different versions
of this discourse can be found in Grohmann 1991; a brief survey of [[MN23]] can be found in Anālayo
2009j. For a discourse quotation in Abhidh-k-� cf. below note 74.
71 According to Jā 12 at Jā I 148,25, Kumāra Kassapa was the name that had been given to the son of a
nun, who had become pregnant before she ordained. He was raised in the king’s household, from where
he went forth at the age of seven.
72 The introductory narration in T 95 differs.
73 Coomaraswamy 1939: 154 note 2 comments, in relation to the present discourse, that “digging for buried treasure, in a spiritual sense, appears several times in RV” (Ṛgveda 佛說蟻喻經 ).

simile reflects the similarity between a termite mound and the human body in that both have several
openings.

76 The translator of T 95, Dānapāla, appears to have been puzzled by the different items unearthed and finally decided to treat all of them as animals. Thus for example the “slaughterhouse”, asisūna, in [[MN23]]
at MN I 143,5, has become the “ā-xī-sū-nă insect”, T 95 at T I 918c2: ; cf. also Grohmann
1991: 65. His difficulties are understandable, since one would not expect a slaughterhouse to be among
the objects unearthed from a termite mound.

states or qualities, such as ignorance, anger, doubt, the hindrances, sensual pleasures,
and lust. Although clinging to the five aggregates needs to be left behind as well, in
other Pāli discourses the five aggregates usually do not form part of lists of unwholesome states or qualities, but tend to occur in contexts requiring an analysis of subjective experience. Hence the occurrence of the five aggregates in the present context is
unusual and their absence in the Chinese versions is more in conformity with the overall nature of the items listed in this simile.


Table 3.3: Contents of the ‘Termite Mound’ in [[MN23]] and its Parallels








|[[MN23]]|[[SA1079]] & [[SA2]] 18 & T 95|[[EA39.9]]|

Another point worthy of note is that the Pāli discourse lists ignorance in the first
place, [78] followed by anger, doubt, and eventually lust. As ignorance is abandoned with
full awakening, doubt is overcome with stream-entry, while anger and lust are left behind with non-return, the Pāli version’s sequence of unearthing items does not reflect
the sequence in which these unwholesome qualities are overcome through the practice
of the path. The same holds true for the Chinese versions. Even though they differ from
the Pāli account in regard to which item is mentioned first, none of them adopts a sequence that would correspond to the successive overcoming of these unwholesome
qualities during progress along the gradual path to full awakening.

MN I 145   The Pāli discourse ends by identifying the final item unearthed, the nāga, as representing an arahant, [79] notably the only out of the various items unearthed that can indeed be found in a termite mound, and also the only item that need not be discarded. [80]
The same identification recurs in the two Sa�yukta-āgama versions and in the individual translation. [81] The Ekottarika-āgama discourse differs from the other versions, as it
identifies the nāga with the Tathāgata, while the Brahmin who gives the instructions
about the unearthing represents an arahant. [82] Judging from the image of the simile and

the testimony of the other versions, the role of the Brahmin as an instructor would better fit the Tathāgata.
According to one of the two Sa�yukta-āgama versions and the individual translation,
the Buddha told Kumāra Kassapa that he should retire to secluded spots and practise
diligently. [83] While the Ekottarika-āgama account does not mention such an instruction,
it does report that Kumāra Kassapa practised diligently and eventually became an arahant, an achievement recorded also in the Pāli commentary. [84]
This suggests that this series of images were the appropriate means for Kumāra Kassapa’s progress, instructing him to meditatively “dig” within himself in order to unearth and then discard what obstructs the attainment of awakening. [85] Kumāra Kassapa’s propensity for the use of images recurs in the Pāyāsi-sutta and its Chinese parallels, according to which he employed a wealth of similes in a discussion with a sceptic
Brahmin, [86] an ability which may have earned him the position of being an outstanding
speaker in the early Buddhist monk community. [87]


[[MN24]] Rathavinīta-sutta

The Rathavinīta-sutta, the “discourse on the relay of chariots”, reports a conversation
between Sāriputta and Pu��a Mantā�iputta about seven stages of purification. This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama and a parallel in the Ekottarika-āgama. [88]
A few lines of this discourse have also been preserved in Sanskrit fragments. [89]
The Rathavinīta-sutta and its Chinese parallels begin with a group of monks who, having come to visit the Buddha, praise Pu��a Mantā�iputta. The three versions differ to
some extent in their listing of his qualities (see table 3.4). They agree that Pu��a had
few wishes, was contented, lived in seclusion, and was endowed with concentration

144-145, 180, 181, and 205. While [[MN24]] and [[MA9]] place the Buddha’s initial exchange with the
monks at Rājagaha, after which the Buddha left for Sāvatthī, according to [[EA39.10]] he had already
come to Sāvatthī when the first meeting with the group of monks took place.

and wisdom. They also make a point of indicating that, with regard to each of his positive qualities, Pu��a encouraged others to develop the same qualities.


Table 3.4: Pu��a’s Qualities in [[MN24]] and its Parallels

|[[MN24]]|[[MA9]]|
|---|---|
|few wishes (1)<br>contented (2)<br>secluded (3)<br>not socializing (4)<br>energetic (5)<br>virtue (6)<br>concentration (7)<br>wisdom (8)<br>liberation (9)<br>knowledge & vision of liberation (10)<br>teaches others (11)|few wishes & contented (→ 1, 2)<br>secluded (→ 3)<br>energetic (→ 5)<br>right mindfulness<br>concentrated (→ 7)<br>wise (→ 8)<br>influxes destroyed (→ 9)<br>teaches others (→ 11)<br> <br> <br>(≠ 4, 6, 10)|



According to the Majjhima-nikāya and the Madhyama-āgama versions, Pu��a was
energetic, [90] while the Ekottarika-āgama discourse describes that he “protects his practice”. [91] Another difference is that the Madhyama-āgama discourse lists right mindfulness as a quality of Pu��a, [92] whereas the Pāli and the Ekottarika-āgama versions at this
point in their sequence of qualities mention his virtue. [93] Consequently, the Madhyamaāgama version proceeds from being energetic via mindfulness to concentration and
wisdom, while the other two versions proceed from virtue via concentration to wisdom.
The Madhyama-āgama version thus follows a pattern found also in the thoughts of [[AN90]] [[MN24]] at MN I 145,23: āraddhaviriyo (Be-MN I 199,10: āraddhavīriyo) and [[MA9]] at T I 430a17: .

great man, recorded in the A�guttara-nikāya, which similarly adopts the sequence energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom, [94] a sequence that also corresponds to
the standard listing of the five faculties (indriya). The Majjhima-nikāya and Ekottarika-āgama versions instead reflect the triad morality-concentration-wisdom, a set found
frequently in the early discourses.
This particular difference is noteworthy in so far as it appears to constitute a pattern
in the respective collections. The Madhyama-āgama parallel to the Mahāgosi�ga-sutta,
in the context of a list of qualities of Mahākassapa, again has right mindfulness in the
place where the corresponding Majjhima-nikāya and Ekottarika-āgama versions mention virtue. [95] Similarly, the Madhyama-āgama version of a list of qualities of the layfollower Hatthaka mentions mindfulness, whereas its A�guttara-nikāya counterparts
mention his virtue. [96]
Another difference in regard to Pu��a’s qualities is that the Ekottarika-āgama parallel to the Rathavinīta-sutta begins its listing with the ascetic practices of living in the
forest, subsisting on alms food, and using rag robes, none of which is mentioned in the
Majjhima-nikāya or Madhyama-āgama versions. [97]
These ascetic practices recur again in the list of the qualities of Mahākassapa in the Mahāgosi�ga-sutta. Although the Madhyama-āgama parallel to the Mahāgosi�ga-sutta
does not mention the ascetic practices, the Ekottarika-āgama parallel to the Mahāgosi�ga-sutta does list them. [98] According to the list of outstanding disciples in the A�guttara-nikāya and Ekottarika-āgama, the undertaking of the ascetic practices was indeed
a characteristic quality of Mahākassapa, [99] so that their absence from the Madhyama-āgama description of this great disciple is unexpected.
The Rathavinīta-sutta and its parallels continue by relating that on a later occasion
Pu��a came to visit the Buddha. [100] After meeting the Buddha, he went to a nearby
grove. [101] Sāriputta, who was keen to meet in person the monk whose praises he had
heard earlier, followed him. [102]

95 [[MA184]] at T I 728c23 lists right mindfulness and clear comprehension,, where [[MN32]] at

96 [[MA41]] at T I 484c2 lists eight qualities of the lay disciple Hatthaka, which include mindfulness,,
while virtue is not mentioned. Two discourses in the A�guttara-nikāya offer similar sets of qualities of
Hatthaka, with [[AN8.23]] at AN IV 217,4 listing seven qualities and [[AN8.24]] at AN IV 220,6 eight qualities. Both sets mention his virtue, but do not include mindfulness. In this case the differences are, however, not limited to mindfulness versus virtue. [[MA41]] also attributes the qualities of being energetic
and concentrated to Hatthaka, two qualities not found in the Pāli versions, while his learnedness and
generosity, mentioned in the two Pāli versions, do not occur in [[MA41]]

100 According to [[MA9]] at T I 430b13, another monk informed Sāriputta of the identity of Pu��a, indicating 念
that he was the monk with a bright skin and a prominent nose who was sitting near the Buddha. Such
details about Pu��a’s appearance are not mentioned in the other versions.
101 Whereas according to [[MN24]] at MN I 146,32 and [[EA39.10]] at T II 734b8 Pu��a went to the nearby

164   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


MN I 147   Once the two monks had spent time in meditative seclusion, Sāriputta went to Pu��a
to pose a set of questions, without revealing his identity. According to all versions, at
the conclusion of their exchange Pu��a explicitly declared that, if he had known from
the outset the identity of his interlocutor, he would not have answered in such detail. [103]
According to the Madhyama-āgama version, he would in fact not have been able to
come out with even a single sentence. [104] That is, Sāriputta apparently needed to conceal
his identity in order to be able to elicit a detailed explanation by Pu��a.
The Pāli and Chinese versions agree that the set of questions asked by Sāriputta were
concerned with seven stages of purification, inquiring from Pu��a if any of these was
the aim of living the holy life under the Buddha. In each case he received a negative reply, as according to Pu��a’s explanation the aim of the holy life is rather Nirvā�a. [105]

MN I 148 Despite some differences in the sequence of their presentation, the three versions
agree that Nirvā�a cannot be identified with any of these purifications, yet at the same
time these purifications are required, since without developing them it will not be possible to reach Nirvā�a.

MN I 149 For the sake of illustration, in all versions Pu��a introduced a simile. According to
this simile, King Pasenadi had some urgent matter to settle at Sāketa, a town apparently over forty miles distant from Sāvatthī. [106] In order to quickly cover this distance,
the king used a relay of seven chariots. Similar to these seven chariots, the seven stages
of purification are the means to reach the final goal. [107]
Regarding these seven stages of purification, it is to some extent puzzling that in all
versions Sāriputta and Pu��a appear to be quite familiar with a set of stages of purification that recurs in only one other Pāli discourse. [108] The Madhyama-āgama version


grove on the same day, according to [[MA9]] at T I 430b15 a night intervened, after which Pu��a and
Sāriputta collected and partook of their alms food the next morning, before approaching the grove for
meditative seclusion.
102 When describing these events, the three versions agree on specifying that Sāriputta took his sitting mat
along when approaching the grove, [[MN24]] at MN I 147,5: nisīdana� ādāya, [[MA9]] at T I 430b20:
, and [[EA39.10]] at T II 734b13: ; cf. also above p. 20.

106 According to Vin I 253,10, the distance between Sāvatthī and Sāketa was six yojanas, according to
Dhp-a I 387,1 seven yojanas, and according to the travel records by Făxiăn ( ) in T 2085 at T LI
860b8 eight yojanas (on the precision of Făxiăn's measurements cf. Weller 1920). A yojana seems to
correspond to the distance covered with one yoke of oxen in a day, which would indeed be about seven 以

might hold a solution to this puzzle, a solution that suggests itself when undertaking a
closer examination of the starting point of the discussion between Sāriputta and Pu��a
Mantā�iputta.
According to the Pāli account of their conversation, the first question, asked by Sāriputta, was if Pu��a was living the holy life under the Blessed One. [109] This question
seems a little beside the point, since for a Buddhist monk there would be no reason to
ask another Buddhist monk if he is living the holy life under the Buddha. [110] The Madhyama-āgama version has the same question, with the difference that according to its
presentation Sāriputta spoke consistently of the holy life being lived under the “recluse
Gotama”. [111] Only at the end of the Madhyama-āgama discourse, when asking for Pu��a’s name and about to reveal his own identity, does Sāriputta change expression, using the (for a Buddhist disciple more appropriate) term Tathāgata to refer to the Buddha. [112]
In the Pāli Nikāyas and the Chinese Āgamas, only those who do not belong to the
Buddhist monastic or lay community employ the expression “recluse Gotama” to refer
to the Buddha. In view of this usage it seems at first sight strange that a discourse
would depict Sāriputta as using such an expression. The Madhyama-āgama presentation, therefore, presents the more difficult or unusual reading. It would be easier to imagine that the unusual expression “sama�a Gotama” in Sāriputta’s mouth was changed to
a more appropriate mode of address during the process of oral transmission, than to envisage a change taking place in the opposite way.
The form of address used by Sāriputta in the Madhyama-āgama version receives support from the Sanskrit fragment parallel to the present discourse, which has preserved
the same expression “recluse” in the context of a question on the purpose of purification. [113] In order to ascertain if the Madhyama-āgama version’s more unusual reading
makes any sense in the present context, a closer look at the situation that would stand
at the background of Sāriputta’s question is required.
According to an account given in the Vinaya, the proper way of sewing up and dying
robes was apparently decided only at a later stage of development of the monastic

110 The commentary, Ps II 155,26, explains that Sāriputta asked this question in order for the conversation
to get started. This commentarial gloss gives the impression as if the commentators were also puzzled
by this question.
111 [[MA9]] at T I 430b26: . The version of this question in [[EA39.10]] at T II 734b18 is of little help.
An obvious error is that it reports Sāriputta addressing Pu��a by name, even though at the conclusion
of their discussion he asks him for his name, as reported in all versions, which would become meaningless if he earlier already used the name. Moreover, the version of the question asked by Sāriputta differs
considerably from the version he is supposed to have repeated just a little later in [[EA39.10]] at T II 734c2,

order. [114] This suggests that, during the early stages of the Buddhist monastic community, its members may not have been easily distinguishable by their outer appearance as
Buddhist monks, since they would presumably have dressed in the way used in general
among recluses and wanderers. This assumption finds support in the Cīvaravastu of the
(Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, which reports that King Bimbisāra on one occasion mistook a heterodox wanderer for being a Buddhist monk. In order to avoid recurrence, according to the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya King Bimbisāra approached the Buddha
and requested him to lay down a stipulation concerning robes that would make it easier
to distinguish Buddhist monks from other wanderers. [115]
Pu��a and Sāriputta appear to have both been ordained soon after the Buddha’s awakening, so that their first meeting recorded in the Rathavinīta-sutta could have taken
place during the early stages of the Buddhist order. [116] Thus it could be imagined that,
when they met, Sāriputta was not immediately recognizable as a Buddhist monk. If
Sāriputta was not recognizable as a Buddhist monk, and if he wanted to avoid being
asked his name, which Pu��a might have done if he had known his visitor to be a Buddhist monk like himself, it would make sense for Sāriputta to act in such a way as to
not be recognized. Acting in such a way, he would appear to Pu��a just like a heterodox wanderer who had chanced by and was curious to find out more about the Buddha’s teaching.
In such a situation it would only be natural for Sāriputta to use the expression “recluse Gotama”, since by using the expression “Blessed One” he would prematurely
give himself away as a follower of the Buddha. That he had been successful in this respect becomes evident at the conclusion of the Madhyama-āgama version, where Pu��a expresses his surprise when finding out that the person he had been conversing with
was a disciple of the Buddha. [117]
This would also explain why Sāriputta, according to the Majjhima-nikāya and Madhyama-āgama versions, continues to ask Pu��a if any of the seven purifications is complete Nirvā�a without clinging. Such a question does not fit a knowledgeable Buddhist
monk in conversation with another Buddhist monk. That moral conduct, for example,
falls short of being the final goal of the Buddhist path should have been fairly well
known even among recently ordained Buddhist monks. Yet, as a question asked by


114 Vin I 286,2 reports the Buddha laying down which colours are to be used to dye robes, and according to
Vin I 287,12 he requested Ānanda to have robes sewn together conforming to the pattern of paddy fields
(cf. also von Hinüber 2006: 7). As Ānanda became the Buddha’s personal attendant only about twenty
years after the Buddha’s awakening (cf. Th 1041), the regulations concerning colour and cut of robes
would presumably pertain to a period that is at least twenty years after the Buddha’s awakening.
115 Dutt 1984b: 49,18; for references to the parallel versions cf. Frauwallner 1956: 98.
116 On Pu��a’s early ordination cf. Malalasekera 1938/1998: 222. That Sāriputta’s ordination took place at
an early stage of the Buddhist order suggests itself from Vin I 42,37; cf. also T 200 at T IV 255b18,
which explicitly places the meeting between Sāriputta and Assaji, which led to Sāriputta’s going forth
as a Buddhist monk, soon after the Buddha’s awakening, .

someone outside of the Buddhist order this query would make sense, since for an outsider the implications of the Buddhist conception of Nirvā�a may not be clear, so that
he might well continue asking if this Buddhist goal of complete Nirvā�a without clinging can be understood in terms of any of the seven stages of purification.
If this much is granted, an intriguing perspective emerges concerning the seven stages
of purification. With Sāriputta acting in such a way that Pu��a was not able to recognize him as a Buddhist monk, the type of terminology used by him would also not be
specific Buddhist terminology, but rather be such terms and expressions as were in
common use among recluses and wanderers in ancient India. To continue acting like an
interested outsider, he would have worded his questions in a way that did not compromise the role he had assumed.
From this it would follow that the seven purifications might have been a list of purifications commonly discussed and aspired to among contemporaries in ancient India.
That is, these seven stages of purification could have been (at least at that time) just
types or stages of purification recognized in general among recluses and wanderers,
instead of being a specific Buddhist doctrine. [118]
This would explain the dearth of material concerning these stages of purification in
other discourses, which makes it so difficult to determine their precise implications.
Such difficulties would only be natural if these stages of purification were not an original Buddhist scheme and therefore had not been given as much attention as other
schemes and aspects of the Buddha’s teaching in the discourses.
Granted this, what is specifically Buddhist about this scheme of purifications would
then be the perspective taken in regard to them. Understood in this way, the central
message of the Rathavinīta-sutta is not the list of individual purifications as such, but
the fact that, while all of them are means to reach the goal, none of them constitutes the
type of purification envisaged as the goal of the holy life: complete Nirvā�a without
clinging. [119]


[[MN25]] Nivāpa-sutta

The Nivāpa-sutta, the “discourse on the bait”, employs the simile of a deer herd that
escapes a hunter to illustrate how a monk can escape from Māra. This discourse has a
parallel in the Madhyama-āgama. [120]


118 Thanissaro 2002: 206 suggests that “perhaps the seven types of purity listed in this discourse were
originally non-Buddhist teachings that ... the early Buddhist community ... adapted to their own purpose for showing that these seven forms of purity functioned, not as a goal of practice, but as stages
along the path”.
119 On the way the seven stages of purification were nevertheless adopted in the Visuddhimagga cf. Anālayo 2009i: 9-11.
120 The parallel is [[MA178]] at T I 718b-720a, which is entitled “discourse on the master hunter”, .
[[MA178]] is located in the Squirrels’ Feeding Ground at Rājagaha, while [[MN25]] takes place in Jeta’s
Grove by Sāvatthī.

168   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


MN I 151   The Nivāpa-sutta and its parallel describe in similar terms the behaviour of four deer
herds in regard to a bait set out by a hunter. [121] The first three herds fall prey to the hunter,
whereas the fourth herd is able to escape by dwelling in an area out of the hunter’s
reach. The two versions agree that “bait” stands for the five types of sense pleasure,
“hunter” for Māra, and “deer” for recluses and Brahmins.

MN I 155   In both versions, the first deer herd in the simile represents recluses and Brahmins
who are heedless when partaking of food, while the second deer herd stands for recluses and Brahmins who live in forest wilds, subsisting on roots and fruits. According
to the Majjhima-nikāya account, the problem with these recluses and Brahmins was
that they lost their deliverance of mind, whereas according to the Madhyama-āgama account they lost their deliverance of mind and their deliverance through wisdom. [122]
In other discourses, deliverance of the mind (cetovimutti) covers deep stages of concentration that can be lost again, [123] but deliverance through wisdom (paññāvimutti)
stands for awakening, [124] something that according to the Theravāda tradition will not
be lost again. The Sarvāstivāda tradition, however, took a different perspective on this
issue, envisaging the possibility that arahants may fall away from the level of awakening or liberation they have achieved. [125] In view of these different positions, it is possible that the reference in the present Madhyama-āgama discourse to deliverance by wisdom being lost again is an expression of this Sarvāstivāda tenet. [126] Alternatively, the
present instance could also be the result of a simple transmission error, where a refer

122 [[MA178]] at T I 719b2: .
123 This becomes evident from the expression “temporary mental liberation”, sāmāyika cetovimutti (CeMN III 272,32: sāmayika), in [[MN122]] at MN III 110,31, and the corresponding in its
Chinese parallel [[MA191]] at T I 738b7, and the corresponding re shig dus ... sems rnam par grol ba in
its Tibetan parallel in Skilling 1994a: 198,7; cf. also Anālayo 2009r.
124 [[MN70]] at MN I 477,33, and its parallel [[MA195]] at T I 751b20 indicate that paññāvimutti/ stands
for full awakening, something which according to [[MN29]] at MN I 197,27 cannot be lost again, a��hānam eta� ... anavakāso ya� so bhikkhu tāya asamayavimuttiyā parihāyetha. For a detailed study of
cetovimutti and paññāvimutti cf. de Silva 1978.
125 This is the parihā�adharma arhat, found in the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya at Abhidh-k 6:56 in Pradhan
1967: 372,19, cf. also T 1558 at T XXIX 129a 便心解脫, 慧解脫衰退 25 and T 1559 at T XXIX 280b15, or in the Abhidharmasamuccaya, Pradhan 1950: 86,14 and T 1606 at T XXXI 753b5, cf. also Rahula 1971: 145. On the same
conception among the Pudgalavādins cf. Thiên Châu 1996/1999: 217, on it in general cf., e.g., Bareau 時 ... 心解脫
1957: 244-245.
126 The same notion can in fact be found explicitly in another discourse in the same collection, [[MA127]] at
T I 616a18, which in a listing of different noble disciples, distinguishes between an arahant 慧解脫 liable to fall
away and an arahant not liable to fall away, and . This discourse does not have a Pāli counterpart. The expression parihānadhamma occurs in Pp 11,29 in relation to jhāna practice, while in Pe�
32,8 this expression qualifies “a person who is guidable, [but] who does not engage in development”,
neyyo puggalo bhāvanānuyogam anuyutto, where, even though the context is an examination of different types of arahant, according to Ñā�amoli 1994: 39 note 93/5 “it is clear that the term as used here is
not applied to an Arahant”.

ence to deliverance of the mind has been accidentally ‘completed’ by adding deliverance through wisdom, as these two terms often occur together.
Even to speak of these recluses and Brahmins to be losing their deliverance of mind,
as done in both versions of the present discourse, is to some extent puzzling, because
the fourth group of recluses and Brahmins were able to go beyond the range of Māra’s
power through attaining the jhānas.
In the discourse, ‘deliverance of the mind’ is an umbrella term for the jhānas, yet according to the Nivāpa-sutta and its Chinese parallel deliverance of the mind was not sufficient to go beyond the range of Māra’s power, while the jhānas were sufficient to do
so. [127] Hence, one may wonder what the difference could be between deliverance of the
mind and the attainment of the jhānas.
According to the commentarial explanation, “deliverance of the mind” in the present
context refers to the resolution of these recluses and Brahmins to live in the forest. [128]
Although this explanation would yield a difference between the second and the fourth
group of recluses and Brahmins, it constitutes an interpretation of the expression “deliverance of the mind” (cetovimutti) that differs considerably from the implication of
this term in its general canonical usage.
The Nivāpa-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel continue by identifying the third
deer herd with recluses and Brahmins who are under the influence of views. The two
versions differ in regard to the views held by this third group of recluses and Brahmins.
The Pāli version lists a standard set of ten views that belong to the category of questions not answered by the Buddha (avyākata), while the Chinese version instead lists
the two views of existence and non-existence. [129]
In both versions, to dwell beyond the range of Māra – corresponding to the fourth
deer herd’s dwelling beyond the hunter’s reach – is reached by developing deeper
stages of concentration, such as the four jhānas, the four immaterial attainments, and
the attainment of cessation, together with the destruction of the influxes. [130] The Madhyama-āgama version also mentions the four brahmavihāras as concentrative attainments that are beyond the reach of Māra. [131]


127 The theme of going beyond Māra’s power through deeper stages of concentration recurs in [[AN9.39]] at
AN IV 434,16, according to which with the immaterial attainments a monk goes beyond the range of
Māra, antam akāsi māra�, apada� vadhitvā māracakkhu�, adassana� gato pāpimato (S [e] -AN IV
452,17: apada� bhanditvā), a passage that uses the same expressions as found in [[MN25]] at MN I 159,14
(here for the first jhāna). [[AN9.39]] at AN IV 434,1 also takes up the four jhānas, although in this case it
uses a somewhat different formulation, according to which with attainment of the jhānas a monk no
longer has any dealings with Māra, akara�īyo mārassa.
128 Ps II 162,19.
129 [[MA178]] at T I 719b23: .
130 [[MN25]] at MN I 160,12 indicates that with the attainment of cessation one has “gone beyond attachment
in the world”, ti��o loke visattika� (S [e] -MN I 311,16: loko), a specification not explicitly made in [[MA178]]
131 [[MA178]] at T I 720a12. Minh Chau 1964/1991: 30 notes this as one of several instances where a Chinese discourse “lays more stress on this practice than its counterpart in Pāli”.

[[MN26]] Ariyapariyesanā-sutta [132]
The Ariyapariyesanā-sutta, the “discourse on the noble quest”, presents an autobiographical account of the Buddha’s quest for awakening. This discourse has a parallel in
the Madhyama-āgama. [133] A few parts of this discourse have also been preserved in
Sanskrit fragments. [134]

MN I 160  The Ariyapariyesanā-sutta begins by relating that a group of monks had approached
Ānanda and expressed their wish to hear a discourse from the Buddha. In reply, Ānanda told them to go to Rammaka’s hermitage. The Ariyapariyesanā-sutta continues by
reporting that the Buddha went with Ānanda to the Hall of Migāra’s Mother for the
day’s abiding. The Madhyama-āgama version sets in only at this point of events, once
the Buddha and Ānanda are already in the Hall of Migāra’s Mother. [135]
The Ariyapariyesanā-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel report that the Buddha
spent the day’s abiding in the Hall of Migāra’s Mother and then went with Ānanda to
take a bath, at the completion of which Ānanda invited the Buddha to come to Rammaka’s hermitage. [136]

MN I 161  The two versions record the Buddha’s arrival at Rammaka’s hermitage and his initial
conversation with the monks in similar terms, [137] after which both versions take up the
two types of quest, the noble and the ignoble one. [138]


132 Be-MN I 216,1 and Se-MN I 312,1 have the title Pāsarāsi-sutta, “the discourse on the heap of snares”;
cf. also below note 235.
133 The parallel is [[MA204]] at T I 775c-778c and has the title “discourse at Rammaka’s [hermitage]”,
, employing as title the name of the Brahmin in whose hermitage the discourse is located. [[MA204]]
has been studied and translated by Minh Chau 1964/1991: 33, 63, 153-159, and 245-250; cf. also Anālayo 2011a. An examination of the Ariyapariyesanā-sutta from different perspectives can be found in
Walters 1999. For a discourse quotation in Abhidh-k-� cf. below note 184.
134 The fragments are SHT I 769 (no. 97 and 98 in Waldschmidt 1952: 48; cf. also SHT X p. 414), SHT V
1332a (p. 227, cf. also SHT VI p. 225 and SHT VII p. 292), SHT V 1714 (pp. 266-267), SHT VI 1493
(p. 161, cf. also SHT VIII p. 206), SHT X 3917 (p. 217), and SHT X 3920 (p. 218). SHT V 1332a,
SHT VI 1493, and SHT X 3917 have preserved counterparts to the introductory narration at MN I 161.
SHT I 769, SHT V 1714, and SHT X 3920 correspond to the Buddha’s reflection whom he should
teach and his meeting with a wanderer at MN I 169-171. 羅摩
135 [[MA204]] at T I 775c 經 13 does report that Ānanda invited the other monks to Rammaka’s hermitage, without, however, giving any reason for this invitation.
136 These events are also recorded in SHT V 1332a and SHT VI 1493. The same introductory narration –
covering the Buddha’s stay at Jeta’s Grove, his begging alms in Sāvatthī, his going with Ānanda to the
Hall of Migāra’s Mother for the day’s abiding, and his approaching the Eastern Bathing Place to take a
bath in the evening – recurs as the introduction to another discourse, [[AN6.43]] at AN III 344,18. The remainder of this discourse proceeds differently, as it records how the Buddha explained to Udāyī what
constitutes a real nāga.
137 According to [[MA204]] at T I 775c28, the monks told the Buddha that they had been “discussing the
Dharma”,, while the corresponding passage in [[MN26]] at MN I 161,27 specifies that the topic of
their discussion had been the Buddha, bhagavantam eva ... ārabbha dhammī kathā. For the monks to
be speaking about the Buddha would provide a good reason for him to give an autobiographical account of his own quest for awakening, thereby taking up a topic already broached by the monks.

In its exposition of the ignoble quest, the Ariyapariyesanā-sutta indicates that gold
and silver are subject to birth, old age, and defilement. [139] Instead of gold and silver, the
Madhyama-āgama version speaks of money and jewellery, which it considers to be
subject to old age and defilement, and also subject to disease, death, and sorrow. [140] It is
perhaps not self-evident how gold and silver, or else money and jewellery, could be
subject to all these predicaments. An attempt at interpretation could be developed with
the help of a simile in the A�guttara-nikāya and its Sa�yukta-āgama parallel, which
describes how removing impurities will lead to a gradual refinement of gold. [141]
This description would indicate in what way gold and silver can be considered subject to defilement. The successful production of pure gold and silver could then be considered as their ‘birth’, their loss of lustre through use as jewellery might be their respective ‘disease’ or ‘old age’, and their final breaking apart might be their respective
‘death’. [142] Since inanimate things like gold and silver, or else jewellery and money,
cannot be affected by sorrow, their reckoning as subject to sorrow should perhaps be
understood to point to the sorrow their loss would cause to their owners.
The Ariyapariyesanā-sutta and its parallel continue by presenting the corresponding
noble quest as the rationale for the Buddha’s going forth. [143] Similar to the account


138 Barua 1967: 205 relates the contrast between the noble quest through going forth and the ignoble quest
for sons and wealth to a similar contrast that revolves around the same concept of esanā in the B�hadāra�yaka Upani�ad 4.4.22: te ha sma putrai�a�āyāś ca vittaiśa�āyaś ca lokai�a�āyaś ca vyutthāya,
atha bhik�ā-carya� caranti, translated by Radhakrishnan 1953/1992: 279 as “they, having risen above
the desire for sons, the desire for wealth, the desire for worlds, led the life of a mendicant”.
139 Unlike the Be, Ce, and Ee, Se-MN I 315,1+6+12 includes gold and silver also in its exposition of what is
subject to disease, death, and sorrow.
140 [[MA204]] at T I 776a7, which in its exposition does not take up the issue of being subject to birth at all.
The distinction between these two quests recurs as a discourse of its own in [[AN4.252]] at AN II 247,17
and in T 765 at T XVII 679b23. [[AN4.252]] and T 765 agree with [[MA204]] on not including birth in their
exposition of the ignoble quest, thereby differing from [[MN26]] at MN I 161,36, which does mention
being subject to birth, jātidhamma. While [[AN4.252]] does not draw out the details of the two quests,
such a detailed treatment can be found in T 765 at T XVII 679b28, which agrees with [[MA204]] on reckoning gold and silver to be subject to old age, disease, death, sorrow, and defilement. [[MA204]] at T I
776a16 also differs from [[MN26]] in that it concludes its exposition of the ignoble quest with the proclamation that in this way it will be impossible to reach Nirvā�[[AN141]] The simile in [[AN5.77]] at AN I 253,17 and its parallel [[SA1246]] at T II 341b26 illustrates the gradual
removal of impurities from the mind by describing how a goldsmith gradually removes impurities from
gold, an image also found in the Yogācārabhūmi, T 1579 at T XXX 343c17; cf. also [[DHP|DHP239]]
142 Although the definitions of birth, old age, and death, given, e.g., in [[MN9]] at MN I 49,20 and MN I 50,5,
clearly indicate that these three terms refer to three stages in the life of a living being, the present passage suggests that the same terms are also used in a more metaphorical way in the early discourses. Another instance of such a usage can be found in Vibh 144,10, which in the context of an application of
dependent arising (pa�icca samuppāda) to mind moments speaks of the “birth”, jāti, and the “old age
and death”, jarāmara�a, of a state of mind; cf. also Anālayo 2008c: 94.
143 The Mahāvastu in Basak 1965: 276,7 or in Senart 1890: 197,16 provides an additional perspective on
the bodhisattva’s noble quest, described in [[MN26]] and [[MA204]] It reports that, soon after going forth,
the bodhisattva met a Brahmin ��i who questioned the bodhisattva about the nature of his quest. The

given in the Ariyapariyesanā-sutta, the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya also indicates that the
bodhisattva’s reflection on birth, old age, disease, and death motivated him to go forth. [144]
The Mahīśāsaka Vinaya, the Mahāvastu of the Mahāsā�ghika-Lokottaravāda Vinaya,
and the Sa�ghabhedavastu of the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya present the same motivation with the help of the well-known legend about the bodhisattva’s four encounters
with an old man, a diseased man, a dead man, and a recluse. [145]
Notably, this account shows some internal inconsistencies in each of these three Vinayas. The Mahīśāsaka Vinaya reports that the bodhisattva, when still young, already
had a desire to go forth. [146] When reporting his fourth encounter with a recluse, according to the same Mahīśāsaka Vinaya the bodhisattva asked his coachman to explain what
‘going forth’ means, [147] a question that would make little sense if at an earlier point of
his life he already had the wish to go forth himself.
The Mahāvastu precedes the bodhisattva’s four encounters by reporting that at an
earlier point of time, when informing his father of his wish to go forth, the bodhisattva
expressed his insight into the inescapability of old age, disease, and death, a report that
would render the episode of the four encounters redundant. [148]
According to the Sa�ghabhedavastu, in reply to the bodhisattva’s inquiry after the
implication of being old or sick during the first and second encounter, his coachman informed him that to be old or to be sick means that one might die soon. [149] The bodhisattva apparently understood this reply, since, instead of asking about the meaning of
“death”, he asked if he was also subject to the same predicament. When in his next encounter the bodhisattva saw a corpse, he asked his driver what “death” means, the not
knowing of which would have rendered the replies he received during the previous outings meaningless. [150]
The internal inconsistencies found in each of these three Vinaya texts reveal the composite nature of this legend. A starting point for the coming into being of this tale could
perhaps be found in a discourse in the A�guttara-nikāya and its parallel in the Madhyama-āgama. [151] These two discourses record the bodhisattva’s reflection that worldlings


bodhisattva replied: “where everything no [longer] comes to be, where everything ceases, where everything is appeased, that track I seek”, yatra sarva� na bhavate, yatra sarva� nirudhyate, yatropaśāmyate sarva�, tat pada� prārthayāmy aha�.
144 T 1428 at T XXII 779c12.
145 An otherwise similar account in the Chinese Udāna collection differs in so far as it mentions only three
encounters (old age, disease, and death), so that here the bodhisattva’s decision to go forth comes without an external prompting by seeing a recluse, cf. T 212 at T IV 620b9.
146 T 1421 at T XXII 101b20: .
147 T 1421 at T XXII 101c17: ? Bareau 1962: 20 notes this internal inconsistency and concludes
that the bodhisattva’s desire to go forth belongs to an older textual stratum that escaped editorial erasing when the later account of his four encounters was introduced.

react with disgust and aversion when they see someone else subject to old age, disease,
and death, even though they are themselves subject to the same predicaments. As the
bodhisattva realized that he was himself subject to old age, disease, and death, whatever pride he had in being endowed with youth, health, and life completely disappeared.
These two discourses thus cover the same themes that recur with considerable narrative
embellishment in the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya, the Mahāvastu, and the Sa�ghabhedavastu.
The Ariyapariyesanā-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel, together with the
Dharmaguptaka Vinaya and the Mahāvastu, [152 ] note that the bodhisattva went forth
against the wish of his weeping parents. [153] The same is also reported in Sanskrit frag
2005: 1342 note 1207, [[AN5.34]] could be the nucleus out of which the legendary account developed.
Weller 1928b: 169 suggests that the development of this account could have been inspired by early attempts to represent the bodhisattva’s insight into these predicaments of life in art, which needed to create symbolic representations in order to render his insight into these predicaments visible.
152 [[MN26]] at MN I 163,29, [[MA204]] at T I 776b3, T 1428 at T XXII 779c15, and the Mahāvastu in Basak
1965: 165,8 (cf. also p. 96,10) or in Senart 1890: 117,19 (cf. also p. 68,20). This part of [[MN26]] recurs
in [[MN85]] at MN II 93 and in [[MN100]] at MN II 212. The Mahāvastu in Basak 1965: 224,7 or in Senart
1890: 159,3 also has the legendary account of the bodhisattva’s secret flight in the middle of the night
in what in this work forms an additional account of the great renunciation. This tale is also found in the
Mahīśāsaka Vinaya, T 1421 at T XXII 102a10. Bareau 1962: 23 draws attention to an inconsistency in
the Mahīśāsaka account, which in T 1421 at T XXII 102a25 describes how the bodhisattva handed over
his clothes to his attendant Chanda, but then in T 1421 at T XXII 102b9, once Chanda had left, narrates
how the bodhisattva gave his costly clothing away again, this time to a hunter in exchange for the latter’s dress.
153 [[MN26]] at MN I 163,29 describes that the bodhisattva went forth even though his “mother and father
were weeping with tearful faces”, mātāpitunna� assumukhāna� rudantāna� (B [e] -MN I 219,30 and S [e]  MN I 318,2: mātāpitūna�, S [e] also reads rodantāna�), a description found similarly in [[DN4]] at DN I
115,17, [[DN5]] at DN I 131,29, [[MN36]] at MN I 240,26, [[MN85]] at MN II 93,19, [[MN95]] at MN II 166,30,
and [[MN100]] at MN II 212,1 (on the contrast between the motif of the mother’s crying when the bodhisattva went forth and her supposed death seven days after giving birth to him cf. also Anālayo 2012g
and Bareau 1974a: 250). The same is recorded in [[DA22]] at T I 95b19 and [[DA23]] at T I 98a20 (parallels
to [[DN4]] and [[DN5]]): “[his] father and mother wept”,, and in [[MA204]] at T I 776b3 (parallel
to [[MN26]]): “[his] father and mother cried”,, a circumstance also reported in the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, T 1428 at T XXII 779c15, and in the Mahāvastu in Basak 1965: 96,10 and 165,8 or in Senart 1890: 68,20 and 117,19. An exception to this pattern is fragment 331r6 in Liu 2009: 50, which refers to the relatives in general, reading akāmakānā� jñātīnā� sā[śruka]��hānā� [ru]dantāmukhānā�.
A minor but perhaps nevertheless noteworthy circumstance is that the above-mentioned Chinese versions mention the father first, whereas the Pāli passages and the Mahāvastu mention the mother first.
Horner 1930/1990: 6 notes the general precedence of the mother in the Pāli compound for parents, mātā-pitu, and suggests that this could point to “some ancient forgotten social organisation, where motherright and mother-rule were dominant features”; cf. also Günther 1944: 78 note 1, Karunaratna 2003a:
44, and Young 2004: 44, who suggests that this “grammatical 父母 ... 涕泣 precedence ... points to the prominence of
the mother in South Asia” (on the eminent role of the mother in modern Sinhalese Buddhism cf. Gom- 父母啼哭
brich 1972). Young 2004: 55 note 66 also points out that the same pattern can be seen in the listing of
the five heinous crimes, cf., e.g., [[MN115]] at MN III 64,30, where matricide comes before patricide. The
same difference in sequence between Pāli and Chinese discourses recurs in several other contexts, such
as [[MN93]] at MN II 153,15: mātu pi sadiso pitu pi sadiso and its parallel [[MA151]] at T I 665a29:
, [[MN115]] at MN III 64,30: mātara� jīvitā voropeyya ... pitara� jīvitā voropeyya and its parallel

ments paralleling the Mahāsaccaka-sutta, which contain a counterpart to this part of
the Ariyapariyesanā-sutta. [154]
While the Ariyapariyesanā-sutta next turns to the bodhisattva’s meeting with Ā�āra
Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta, [155] the Madhyama-āgama parallel to the Ariyapariyesanā-sutta precedes the same by describing that the bodhisattva developed self-restraint
and purity, a point also made in the Sanskrit fragments paralleling the Mahāsaccaka

[[MA181]] at T I 724a2:, [[MN117]] at MN III 72,11: atthi mātā atthi pitā and its parallel [[MA189]] at
T I 735c20:, where the Tibetan parallel also mentions the father first, cf. D (4094) mngon pa,
nyu 44b2 or Q (5595) thu 84a3: pha yod do, ma yod do, [[MN130]] at MN III 179,33: n’ eva mātarā kata�
na pitarā kata� and its parallel [[MA64]] at T I 504a10: . Precedence to the mother is given also
in a Tocharian fragment, THT 2375q.[[AN2]] in Peyrot 2008: 121, which reads mātär pā(tär), counterpart to
[[DHP|DHP294-295]] mātara� pitara� hantvā, cf. also the Udāna-(varga) 33.61-62 in Bernhard 1965: 494495. An exception to this pattern is [[MN86]] at MN II 102,8, where A�gulimāla mentions first his father
and then his mother when describing his parentage, a sequence also found in the parallel [[EA38.6]] at T II
720c19, so that in this instance both versions appropriately reflect the patrilinear descent that characterized ancient Indian society. In fact, in other instances of descriptions of comparable pairs (with each
member having the same syllable count) the male usually precedes the female, as can be seen in [[DN14]] 害父母
at DN II 26, 有父有母 14: devo vā devī vā, [[DN32]] at DN III 203,7+9: yakkhapotako vā yakkhapotikā vā ... gandhabbo vā gandhabbī vā, [[MN35]] at MN I 234,9: kumārakā vā kumārikā vā, and in [[MN73]] at MN I
493,19: upāsakā ca ... upāsikā ca. Usually, it is only when the syllable count of such pairs differs and 非父母為
the law of waxing syllables makes itself felt that a term with less syllables takes precedence over a term
with more syllables even though this involves putting the female before the male, as for example in
[[MN5]] at MN I 32,26: itthī vā puriso vā (for examples of the same pattern in other ancient Indian texts
cf. Caland 1931: 62). According to Warder 1963/1991: 97, in dvanda compounds “the more important
or leading object, if any, sometimes occupies the second position, which is normally the dominant position in Pali”, for which he gives the examples candima-suriyā, sama�a-brāhma�ā, sāriputta-moggallāna� and patta-cīvara�. While the case of candima-suriyā is similar to mātā-pitu, in that here too the
female (moon) precedes the male (sun), the other examples do not seem to illustrate his suggestion too
well. In the case of sama�a-brāhma�ā, just as the discourses usually list the warriors before the Brahmins, so too they list recluses before Brahmins, the Buddha being a recluse and a warrior himself, so
that in this instance the more important of the pair seems to come first. In regard to Sāriputta and (Mahā-)moggallāna, judging from [[SNP3.7]] at [[SNP557]] [[UD2.8]] at [[UD17.29]] and Th 1083 a case could be made
for considering Sāriputta to be the more important one of the two chief disciples. In the case of pattacīvara, the law of waxing syllables would be responsible for the sequence of these two words. Thus
Warder’s explanation does not seem to be backed up by the examples he selected. In fact, according to
vārttika 3 on Pā�ini 2.2.34 in Vasu 1891/1997: 273, in dvandva compounds the first member holds the
place of honour. Regarding the compound mātā-pitu, B [e] -Sadd I 73 suggests that the sequence mātā-pitu
is adopted due to an euphonic reason, since to adopt the sequence pitā-māta would not be respecting or
honouring the arrangement of sounds, saddaracanā apūjanīyā. In the case of the Chinese translations,
perhaps this order was then reversed, in line with the observation by Paul 1980: 217 that in order “to
accommodate the Confucian norms, Buddhist texts were changed to reflect the subordinate position of
women in traditional Chinese society”, cf. also Guang Xing 2005: 98 note 12, who similarly suggests
that the precedence given to the father in Chinese translations could reflect the influence of Confucian
thought.
154 Fragment 331r6-332v5 in Liu 2009: 50-52 (the Pāli parallel to these fragments, [[MN36]] at MN I 240,26,
abbreviates, referring back to the full text given in [[MN26]]).
155 Be-M I 221,19 spells the latter’s name as Udaka.

sutta. [156] The Divyāvadāna, the Lalitavistara, [157] the Mahāvastu, the Sa�ghabhedavastu,
and the Pāli commentary to the Therīgāthā report that the bodhisattva visited other hermit(s) before meeting Ā�āra Kālāma, thereby also indicating that he undertook some
spiritual training before placing himself under Ā�āra’s tutelage. [158]
According to the Ariyapariyesanā-sutta’s account, the bodhisattva first learned theoretical aspects of Ā�āra Kālāma’s teaching. This much accomplished, he asked Ā�āra
Kālāma about the latter’s practical experience, in reply to which Ā�āra Kālāma described the sphere of nothingness. [159] The Madhyama-āgama version does not record
that the bodhisattva learned theoretical aspects of Ā�āra Kālāma’s teaching. According
to its presentation, Ā�āra Kālāma straightaway informed the bodhisattva about the attainment of the sphere of nothingness, achieved by completely surmounting the sphere
of [infinite] consciousness. [160] The same is the case for the Sanskrit fragments paralleling the Mahāsaccaka-sutta. [161]
The Ariyapariyesanā-sutta, its Madhyama-āgama counterpart, and the Sanskrit fragments paralleling the Mahāsaccaka-sutta report that the bodhisattva set out to reach the
same realization, reflecting that he had the same mental qualities as Ā�āra Kālāma.
While according to the Pāli and Sanskrit versions these mental qualities comprise the
five faculties (indriya), [162] the Madhyama-āgama version lists only confidence, energy,


156 While [[MA204]] at T I 776b5 reads, fragment 331r7 in Liu 2009: 50
reads kāyena sa�v�to viharāmi vācā āj[ī]va[�] ca pa[riś]odha[yā]mi.
157 Oldenberg 1882: 115 draws attention to the fact that the Lalitavistara changes narrative voice when reporting the bodhisattva’s training under Ā�āra Kālāma. While other parts of the Lalitavistara refer to
the bodhisattva in the third person, iti hi bhik�avo bodhisattvo, cf., e.g., Lefmann 1902: 238,12 or Vaidya
1958b: 174,11, the present part is formulated in the first person singular, tato ’ha� bhik�avo, cf. Lefmann 1902: 238,19 or Vaidya 1958b: 174,16, a change already noticed by Weller 1915: 30. This shows
that the Lalitavistara incorporates material from different textual layers, at times apparently preserving
early passages in a fairly original form. The same holds for the Mahāvastu, whose composite nature has
been examined by various scholars, cf., e.g., Barth 1899, Charpentier 1909: 33, de La Vallée Poussin
1915a, Hiraoka 2002/2003, Law 1930b: 護身命清淨, 15, Oldenberg 護口 ...意命清淨 1912a, Rahula 1978: 13-16, Windisch 1909,

and wisdom, thereby not including mindfulness and concentration. [163] Since mindfulness and concentration are required to reach deeper levels of concentration, the Pāli
and Sanskrit listings of mental qualities appear to offer a more complete presentation.
According to all three accounts, the bodhisattva soon was able to attain the sphere of
nothingness, for which sake, according to the Madhyama-āgama account and the Sanskrit fragments, he had diligently practised in solitude and seclusion. [164] When the bodhisattva informed Ā�āra Kālāma of the realization he had attained, Ā�āra Kālāma invited the bodhisattva to become the co-leader of their group. Since the attainment of
the sphere of nothingness was not the final goal he was searching for, according to all
versions the bodhisattva decided to leave Ā�āra Kālāma. [165]
The Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, the Lalitavistara, the Mahāvastu, and the Sa�ghabhedavastu also do not report that the bodhisattva learned theoretical aspects of Ā�āra Kālāma’s teaching, thereby agreeing with the Madhyama-āgama account and the Sanskrit
fragments paralleling the Mahāsaccaka-sutta. [166] An exception to this is the Buddhacarita, which reports the theory imparted by him in detail. [167]
The Lalitavistara and the Sa�ghabhedavastu list all five mental faculties, [168] thereby
agreeing with the Ariyapariyesanā-sutta and the Sanskrit fragments paralleling the Mahāsaccaka-sutta. The Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, however, mentions only the set of three

to saddhā in the present context stands for “confidence in his abilities to develop the powers necessary
to achieve his object”. Tilakaratne 1997: 608 notes that the attribution of saddhā to Ā�āra Kālāma and
later on also to Uddaka Rāmaputta shows that the conception of saddhā was not confined to “belief in
the Buddha, dhamma and the sa�gha”. On śraddhā in ancient Indian literature cf., e.g., Köhler 1948/1973.

although Wynne 2007: 13 suggests that Ā�āra Kālāma may have lived in the vicinity of Kapilavatthu.
167 Buddhacarita stanzas 12:16-42 in Johnston 1936/1995a: 130-133. Nakamura 1979: 275 comments that
in these stanzas Ā�āra “is found to voice Sā�khya philosophy”, for a detailed survey of relevant points
cf. Johnston 1936/1995b: lvi-lxii; cf. also Strauß 1913: 258. According to Malalasekera 1937/1995:
296, although these stanzas have “some resemblance ... to the Sā�khya philosophy, ... in Ā�āra’s teaching some of the salient characteristics of the Sā�khya system are absent”. On this topic cf. also Bhagat
1976: 156, Oldenberg 1898: 681-684, and Thomas 1933/2004: 80. Rüping 1977: 90 and Senart 1907:
153 hold that Ā�āra and Uddaka were proponents of Yoga theories. Schumann 2006: 85-86 argues for
Uddaka being a teacher of Upani�adic philosophy, based on the similarity between Chāndogya Upani�ad 6.12.1, cf. Radhakrishnan 1953/1992: 462: “‘what do you see there?’ ‘Nothing at all’”, kim atra
paśyasīti? na ki� cana, and the dictum associated with Uddaka in [[DN29]] at DN III 126,17: “‘seeing he
does not see’. What ‘seeing does he not see’”, passa� na passatīti, kiñ ca passa� na passatīti?; cf. also
the similarly worded passage in the parallel [[DA17]] at T I 74a6: “there being seeing, [yet] he does not
see. What is said to be ‘seeing he does not see’”, ? Wynne 2007: 45-49 points
out another parallel in B�hadāra�yaka Upani�ad 4.3.23, cf. Radhakrishnan 1953/1992: 263: “he is,
verily, seeing, though he does not see”, paśyan vai tan na paśyati.

mental qualities found in the Madhyama-āgama account: confidence, energy, and
wisdom. [169]
The Ariyapariyesanā-sutta and its parallels present the bodhisattva’s meeting with
Uddaka Rāmaputta and his subsequent attainment of the sphere of neither-perceptionnor-non-perception in accordance with their respective descriptions of his earlier meeting with Ā�āra Kālāma. The Dharmaguptaka Vinaya offers the additional information
that Uddaka Rāmaputta had become the leader of the group of disciples after the death
of their teacher Rāma. [170]
While the Ariyapariyesanā-sutta, its parallel in the Madhyama-āgama, the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, and the Mahāvastu attribute the attainment of the sphere of neitherperception-nor-non-perception to Uddaka’s father Rāma, the presentation in the Sanskrit fragments paralleling the Mahāsaccaka-sutta, the Lalitavistara, and the Sa�ghabhedavastu reads as if Uddaka himself had reached this attainment. [171]


169 According to the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, T 1428 at T XXII 780b11, the bodhisattva reflected that Ā�āra was bereft of confidence, energy, and wisdom, a statement which, as Bareau 1963: 18 notes, must be
a mistake by the translator who perhaps misunderstood the expression “not only (na kho) Ā�āra Kālāma
has confidence ... (etc.)”, to mean that Ā�āra Kālāma had no confidence,, etc. A similar error
can be found in a record of the same event in a Chinese Udāna translation, T 212 at T IV 644a19, which
similarly indicates that Ā�āra Kālāma had no confidence,, a reading also found in its description
of the bodhisattva’s reflection regarding Uddaka Rāmaputta, T 212 at T IV 644b1.The same version
also speaks of only two qualities, confidence and wisdom. The Mahāvastu in Basak 1965: 166,7 or in
Senart 1890: 118,10 has three, which in addition to the faculties of confidence and energy includes
“strength”, bala.
170 T 1428 at T XXII 780b29. From the account in [[MN26]] it is not clear if Uddaka was called Rāmaputta in
the sense of being his biological or his spiritual son. In [[MA204]] at T I 776c12, Uddaka Rāmaputta refers to Rāma as “my father”,, which suggests a biological relationship. In the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, T 1428 at T XXII 780c3, however, he speaks of Rāma as “my teacher 無有信 ”, . Perhaps Rāma was
both his father and his teacher.
171 Fragment 332r2-8 in Liu 2009: 51-52, the Lalitavistara in Lefmann 1902: 244, 無信 13 or in Vaidya 1958b:
180,15, and the Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1977: 98,20; the same is also the case for T 212 at T IV
644a27. On these differences cf. Skilling 1981 and Wynne 2007: 14-15. Some degree of uncertainty
concerning Uddaka and Rāma seems to have already existed at an early time, since even though in [[MA204]] it is throughout clear that the attainment should be attributed to Rāma, at one point in [[MA204]] at T
I 776c9 the bodhisattva asks Uddaka after his own attainment, referring to what “you, Rāmaputta, know
yourself”,, with a,, and variant reading according to which he asked after the
father’s attainment, speaking of what 我父 “your father Rāma knew himself”, . The Mahāvastu in Basak 1965: 168,12 or in Senart 1890: 120,6 has a similar uncertainty at the same junction of 我師
events, since the bodhisattva asks Udraka Rāmaputra after the attainment of Udraka Rāma, ettako ya�
bho udrakena bhavatā rāme�a dharmo adhigato, continuing, however, by speaking of the attainment
made by Rāma, cf. Basak 1965: 168,14 or Senart 1890: 120,9: rāme�a adhigato. The similar mistake
found in these two accounts from quite different reciter traditions confirms the suggestion by Wynne
2005: 61 that the information on the two teachers of the Buddha must be fairly early, since it would be
”inconceivable that this correspondence was produced by a later levelling of texts”. According to [[SN35.103]] in SN IV 83,3 and its parallel [[MA114]] at T I 603a7, Uddaka Rāmaputta claimed to have reached
accomplishment. Perhaps this should be understood to mean that during the six years period between 汝羅摩子自知 宋 元 明
his meeting with the bodhisattva and his death he eventually did reach what his father had attained. Be- 汝父羅摩自知

The Ariyapariyesanā-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel describe the Buddha’s
awakening only in brief. The Madhyama-āgama version reports that he sat down with
the firm determination to not get up from his sitting posture unless full awakening has
been reached. [172] Although the Ariyapariyesanā-sutta does not mention this, other discourses associate the same determination with the Buddha’s awakening. [173]

MN I 167   The Ariyapariyesanā-sutta continues by recording that the Buddha felt disinclined to
teach others. [174] According to the Pāli account, Brahmā Sahampati had become aware of
this disinclination and approached the Buddha in order to convince him to teach. [175]
This episode is not found in the Madhyama-āgama discourse at all.
The Buddha’s reluctance to teach, followed by Brahmā’s request, recurs in two other
Pāli discourses, [176] in an Ekottarika-āgama discourse, [177] and in several biographies of
the Buddha preserved in Chinese. [178] The same is also found in Sanskrit fragments of
the Catu�pari�at-sūtra, [179] and in the Lalitavistara. [180]

III 82b6 report various monks speaking in praise of qualities they themselves possessed, an occasion on
which the Buddha extolled the determination to not get up from the sitting posture until awakening has
been attained. This implies that such determination was characteristic of his own striving for awakening. The same can be seen more explicitly in [[AN4.1]] at AN I 50,8, according to which the Buddha
reached awakening by striving with the firm determination not to give up even if the flesh and blood of
his body should dry up. This determination is also reported in the Jātaka Nidānakathā at Jā I 71,24.
174 Franke 1914b: 342 notes that the introductory remark in [[MN26]] at MN I 168,4, according to which the
stanzas expressing the Buddha’s hesitation to teach were “unheard before”, pubbe assutapubbā 象頂, stands
to some degree in contrast to the report in [[DN14]] at DN II 36,14 that the previous Buddha Vipassī had
the same reflection in the same words, similarly introduced as pubbe assutapubbā. Regarding the
stanza in [[MN26]] at MN I 168,5 cf. also the discussion in Pind 1997: 529-536.
175 [[MN26]] at MN I 168,20. Schmithausen 2005a: 172 note 19 explains that by inviting the Buddha to teach,
Brahmā is “implicitly urging his own worshippers, the Brahmans, to acknowledge the superiority of the
Buddha and his teaching”. Gombrich 2009: 183 comments that “the Buddhist claim to supersede brahmin teaching could not be more blatant”. The entreaty to teach has become a favourite topic for sculptural representations, cf., e.g., Bautze-Picron 2008: 166 plate 2, Dobbins 1971: 25, Huntington 2001: 120
and 134, Kurita 1988: 77-79 plates P2-vii to ix and pp. 125-136 plates 245-267, Foucher 1905: 425 figure

as the entreaty to teach might simply depict a scene of worship in general.

Chapter 3 Opamma-vagga                                   -  179


The Buddha’s disinclination to teach and Brahmā’s intervention recur, moreover, in
the Mahāvastu, [181] in the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, [182] in the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya, [183] in the
(Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, [184] and in the Theravāda Vinaya. [185]
The agreement found among such a broad range of sources suggests this episode to
be relatively early, although its absence from the Madhyama-āgama discourse could
point to a still earlier stage when Brahmā had not yet become a protagonist in the account of the Buddha’s awakening. [186] Be that as it may, the passage does present a problem not easy to solve: [187] How to combine the Buddha’s reluctance to teach with the
idea, common to all Buddhist traditions, that the Buddha had prepared himself over incalculable time periods for precisely this task? [188]
Faced with the problem posed by this episode, the Pāli commentary attempts an explanation by suggesting that the Buddha only hesitated to teach because on examination he realized the degree to which people were under the influence of defilements. [189]
Moreover, according to the commentary the Buddha wanted Brahmā to invite him, since
this would make people in the world have respect for what the Buddha was going to
teach. [190]

181 Basak 1968/2004: 188,14 or Senart 1897: 315,1. The Mahāvastu reports Brahmā’s intervention also as
part of the events preceding the teaching career of Dīpa�kara Buddha, cf. Basak 1963a: 285,8 or Senart

185 Vin I 5,13. In this context it is perhaps also noteworthy that, whereas the other Vinayas cover the events
leading up to the Buddha’s awakening, the Theravāda Vinaya account sets in only once the awakening
has already been accomplished. Zafiropulo 1993: 24 draws attention to Vin I 1,4, which starts with the
expression tena samayena, an expression not used at the beginning of a chapter elsewhere in the Vinaya
or in other discourse passages. Moreover, the first chapter of the Mahāvagga at Vin I 2,27 concludes
with the remark that the account of the awakening is completed, bodhikathā ni��hitā, even though this
chapter only reports events that took place after the awakening. Zafiropulo concludes that an account of
the awakening itself may have preceded what at present is the beginning of the Mahāvagga, an account
that was lost during the process of transmission.

187 An extract from the present discussion already appeared in Anālayo 2010f: 22-24.
188 Schmithausen 2000c: 120 note 5 draws attention to the way Buddhacarita 14.97 has ironed out the difficulty with this passage by reporting that the Buddha remembered his former vow and decided to teach
even before Brahmā intervened.
189 Ps II 176,21. The commentary at this point speaks of the Buddha surveying the world with his omniscient knowledge. Bareau 1963: 142 comments that, on the commentarial explanation, one may wonder
why the Buddha nevertheless remained blind to the potential of beings to understand his teachings.
190 Ps II 177,11. The Lalitavistara in Lefmann 1902: 395,16 or in Vaidya 1958b: 289,9 similarly explains


180   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


These explanations by the Pāli commentators are not particularly convincing. The
first explanation confuses the temporal sequence of events, since according to the Ariyapariyesanā-sutta the Buddha’s reluctance to teach occurred before he examined the
degree to which beings in the world are defiled. [191] Once he did survey their condition,
after Brahmā’s request, according to the Ariyapariyesanā-sutta the Buddha realized
that some beings would understand and thereon decided to teach. As made explicit in
the Catu�pari�at-sūtra, the Mahāvastu, and the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, the result
of the Buddha’s survey of the world was not that he felt reluctant to teach, but rather
that great compassion arose in him. [192]
The second explanation is even less convincing, since it would imply that the Buddha’s disinclination had the ulterior purpose of getting Brahmā to invite him in order to
enhance his reputation. Such an act would not be easily compatible with the way the discourses portray the personal integrity of the Buddha. Besides, in the statement given to
the monks present in Rammaka’s hermitage, the Buddha explicitly informs them of his
initial disinclination to teach. [193] This passage confirms that, from the perspective of the
present discourse, the Buddha was indeed reluctant to spread the message of liberation.
The reason for his reluctance, according to the Ariyapariyesanā-sutta, was that it
would be fatiguing (kilamatha) and vexing (vihesā) for him if others should fail to understand the profound and sublime truth he had realized. [194] The same reason becomes


that the Buddha showed hesitation to teach in order to instil respect for his teaching in the world, thereby getting the supreme Brahmā to request that the Buddha teach the Dharma.
191 [[MN26]] at MN I 168,1 reports the Buddha’s reluctance to teach, and at MN I 169,7 describes how he
surveyed the degree to which beings were defiled.
192 The Catu�pari�at-sūtra fragment [[MN480]]R3-4 in Waldschmidt 1952: 44, the Mahāvastu in Basak 1968/
2004: 190,23 or in Senart 1897: 318,15 (on similarities in the formulation of this passage and its counterpart in the Lalitavistara cf. Skilling 2002/2003: 96 note 10), and the Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli
1977: 130,6, with its Chinese counterpart in T 1450 at T XXIV 126c22 and its Tibetan counterpart in
Waldschmidt 1957a: 119,3, agree that once the Buddha had surveyed the world, great compassion arose
in him. As noted by Robinson 1970/1982: 22, “in the Buddhist myths Brahmā claims to see everything,
so it is appropriate that he should tell the hesitant Gautama that there were living beings ready to recognize the Dharma. Then and only then did Gautama use his Buddha-eye to confirm this fact”.
193 [[MN26]] at MN I 168,9: “considering thus, monks, my mind inclined to inaction, not to teaching the
Dharma”, iti ha me, bhikkhave, pa�isañcikkhato appossukkatāya citta� namati, no dhammadesanāya.
194 [[MN26]] at MN I 168,2. It is notable that the stronger of the two terms, vihesā, recurs in [[MN26]] at MN I
169,26 in the related form vihi�sa, in a reference to the Buddha’s disinclination to teach as vihi�sasaññī, “perception of harm”. The Mahāvastu in Basak 1968/2004: 190,29 or in Senart 1897: 319,5 similarly speaks of vihe�asa�jñā�, while the Catu�pari�at-sūtra fragment [[MN480]]R5 in Waldschmidt 1952:
44 reads vihi�haprek�e, and the Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1977: 130,10 has vihe�haprek�ī (the Chinese counterpart in T 1450 at T XXIV 126b14 speaks of “weariness”,, and of “vexation”,, the
Tibetan version in Waldschmidt 1957a: 111,2 of “fatigue”, dub pa, and “weariness”, ngal ba, followed
by concluding that this is so “just because of a lack of enthusiasm in the mind”, sems la spro ba med
par kho nar ’gyur bar zad pas). In [[EA19.1]] at T II 593a29, the reason for the Buddha’s disinclination to
teach is, for which Hirakawa 1997: 556 lists among others the equivalents upaghāta, upahata and
√hi�s, a character translated by Soothill 1937/2000: 402 as “hurt”, or “damage”. The Dharmaguptaka
and the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya, T 1428 at T XXII 786c6 and T 1421 at T XXII 103c13, speak of the arising
疲勞 惱

Chapter 3 Opamma-vagga                                   -  181


even more evident in the Theravāda Vinaya, according to which a single request was
not sufficient to overcome the Buddha’s disinclination to teach, since Brahmā Sahampati had to repeat his request three times before the Buddha consented. [195] The Mahāvastu reports that Brahmā at first convinced Sakka, the king of gods, to request the
Buddha to teach, a request which did not meet with success, followed by trying the
same himself, again without success. [196]
This reluctance to teach does not seem to stand in contrast to the Buddha’s earlier
motivation to seek awakening, recorded in the Ariyapariyesanā-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel. According to both versions, the Buddha described his motivation
to go forth in search of awakening entirely in personal terms, indicating that he had
realized to be “himself” subject to old age, disease, and death and therefore wanted to
find a way out of this predicament for “himself”. [197] These descriptions do not in any
way allude to a wish to save or help others.
Additional perspectives on the Buddha’s attitude after his awakening can be found in
the Brahmanimanta�ika-sutta and in the Mahāparinibbāna-sutta. The Brahmanimanta�ika-sutta records the Buddha explaining that his condition of inner freedom was independent of whether he taught or not. [198] The Mahāparinibbāna-sutta and its parallels
report that the Buddha renounced his life principle and thereby set an end to his teaching activities because Ānanda had failed to request the Buddha to stay alive. [199] Bringing these two discourses together, the point that would emerge from them could be
summed up as follows:
From an early Buddhist perspective, when the Buddha was requested to teach, he did
so; when, however, on a subsequent occasion he was not requested to continue teaching, he simply stopped. In other words, the discourses present his realization as some

of “weariness”,, and dukkha, . Thus the different sources agree that the Buddha anticipated that
he might experience mental weariness or even vexation; cf. also Webster 2005b: 20.
195 Vin I 6,20. The need for three requests before the Buddha agreed is also recorded in T 189 at T III
643a17. To grant a request after it has been made three times is a standard procedure in the discourses.
196 Basak 1968/2004: 188,15 or Senart 1897: 315,2. Stanzas with which Sakka and then Brahmā respectively invite the Buddha to teach can be found in [[SN11.17]] at SN I 233,32 (or SN [2] 263 at SN [2] I 501,17),
a discourse which, however, takes place at Jeta’s Grove by Sāvatthī. A similar set of stanzas occurs in
the Lalitavistara in Lefmann 1902: 397,1 or in Vaidya 1958b: 289,29. Stanzas spoken by two devas in
order to invite the Buddha to teach, although at an earlier junction of events, can be found in the Catu�pari�at-sūtra fragment [[SN362]] (42)V2-3 in Waldschmidt 1952: 27 (cf. also Waldschmidt 1957a: 74 note
8), and in the Sa�ghabhedavastu 勞疲 in Gnoli 1977: 121, 苦 15. The Jātaka Nidānakathā at Jā I 81,10 also reports that Brahmā Sahampati was accompanied by Sakka when entreating the Buddha to teach.

thing self-sufficient, without any need to proselytise in order to corroborate the truth he
had discovered. [200]
Other discourses present Brahmā’s intervention as a natural part of the sequence of
events that lead up to the teaching activity of a Buddha, as the Mahāpadāna-sutta and
its Dīrgha-āgama parallel report that the same happened in the case of the previous
Buddha Vipassī. [201] Although some discourses indicate that Gotama was destined to become a teacher, [202] Brahmā Sahampati’s role at the present junction of events appears to
have been necessary in order for the Buddha’s teaching career to begin. [203]

MN I 170   After relating Brahmā’s intervention, the Ariyapariyesanā-sutta continues by reporting that the Buddha first intended to share his discovery with his two former teachers,
Ā�āra Kālama and Uddaka Rāmaputta, an intention described in similar terms in the
Madhyama-āgama parallel. Finding out that Ā�āra Kālama and Uddaka Rāmaputta had
recently passed away, the Buddha decided to approach his former five companions,
who had been with him during the period when he had undertaken ascetic practices.
The Mahīśāsaka Vinaya and the Sa�ghabhedavastu report that these five former
companions had been sent by the Buddha’s father to look after the bodhisattva. [204] According to the Lalitavistara, however, the same five had been disciples of Uddaka Rāmaputta and had witnessed how the bodhisattva quickly achieved what they had not
been able to achieve even after a long time. [205] The fact that he then did not rest satisfied
with this achievement had motivated them to leave Uddaka and follow the bodhisattva.
The Lalitavistara’s presentation fits the flow of the narration well, since if the five
had been ordered to attend on the bodhisattva, one would not expect them to abandon
their mission only because the bodhisattva decided to stop his self-mortifications. If,
however, they had followed him on their own and in the hope to benefit from his realizations, it would be natural for them to leave him once he gave up his ascetic striving
and thereby abandoned what they held to be the path required to reach awakening.

200 Keown 1992/2001: 42 comments: “the Buddha’s hesitation suggests that although the Buddha was
moved to teach, teaching is not entailed by the ... realisation [he had] attained”.
201 [[DN14]] at DN II 36,19 and [[DA1]] at T I 8b21. Notably, another parallel, T 3 at T I 156c14, and the Sanskrit fragments of the Mahāvadāna-sūtra (cf. the remark by Waldschmidt 1956: 148 note 2) do not
mention such an intervention by Brahmā.

(translated in Bareau 1988a: 79), the five had already followed the bodhisattva since the time of his
birth, a presentation that would support associating them with the Buddha’s family and home country.

玄奘


Chapter 3 Opamma-vagga                                   -  183


The Ariyapariyesanā-sutta, its parallel in the Madhyama-āgama, and a partial parallel from the Ekottarika-āgama report in similar terms that, on his way to Vārā�asī, the
Buddha met another wanderer, whom the Pāli version introduces as the Ājīvika Upaka. [206] During this meeting, the Buddha proclaimed that he had reached full awakening.
This proclamation apparently did not convince Upaka, since all versions report that he
left the Buddha and took a different road.
The three discourses differ to some extent on the stanzas spoken during this meeting.
They agree that Upaka inquired after the Buddha’s teacher, to which the Buddha replied by proclaiming the superiority of his insight and stating that, since he had realized awakening on his own, he had no teacher.
While according to the Ekottarika-āgama account the Buddha spoke the remaining
stanzas without any further question being asked by Upaka, according to the Majjhimanikāya and Madhyama-āgama accounts Upaka asked if the Buddha considered himself
a “conqueror”, [207] in reply to which the Buddha affirmed to be a conqueror.
The expression “conqueror” is not an epithet used regularly in other discourses for the
Buddha, but a term more typically associated with the Jains and perhaps other contemporary ascetics. [208] For the Buddha’s reply to use this type of terminology it would be
more natural if such usage was prompted by a question that employs this term. When
considered from this perspective, the question found in the Pāli and the Madhyama-āgama versions fits the context well as a way of eliciting the Buddha’s affirmation that he
is a conqueror.
According to the Madhyama-āgama discourse, in addition to this question Upaka
also inquired about the Buddha’s future plans. Although the other two versions do not
record such a question, the three discourses agree that the Buddha explained to be on
his way to Vārā�asī in order to set the wheel of Dharma in motion. [209] While in the
other two versions this statement is still part of the Buddha’s reply about the identity of
his teacher, in the Madhyama-āgama’s presentation the Buddha states his future plans
in reply to Upaka’s question after these future plans, which thus constitutes the last of
the stanzas he speaks to Upaka.


206 While [[MA204]] at T I 777b11 qualifies Upaka as a “heterodox practitioner”,, [[EA24.5]] at T II
618c1 presents him as a Brahmin, (as does a short extract from the present event in the Chinese
Dharmapada Avadāna and the Chinese Udāna collection, T 211 at T IV 594b10 and T 212 at T IV
717b18). The Catu�pari�at-sūtra fragment 484bV7 in Waldschmidt 1952: 50, the Mahāvastu in Basak
1968/2004: 194,14 or in Senart 1897: 325,12, and the Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1977: 131,23 agree
with [[MN26]] and Vin I 8,11 in introducing him as an ājīvika.
207 [[MN26]] at MN I 171,13 and [[MA204]] at T I 777b20.
208 The present reply to Upaka seems to be the only instance in the discourses where the Buddha refers to
himself as a jina; cf. also Jaini 1988/2001: 480. Von Hinüber 2009a: 145 notes that the expression employed by Upaka in his reply to the Buddha’s proclamation points to the ancient nature of this episode.
209 [[MN26]] at MN I 171,11, [[MA204]] at T I 777b26, and [[EA24.5]] at T II 618c10. In relation to this stanza, 異學
Wagle 1966: 23 points out that the word 梵志 pura in [[MN26]] at MN I 171,11 is a word of rare occurrence
(cf. also [[SN45.1]] at [[SNP976]] and [[SNP991]]), explaining that passages in which it occurs can be considered to
belong to the earliest material in the Pāli Canon (cf. also note 208 above).


184   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


The sequence found in the Madhyama-āgama version receives support from the Chinese, Sanskrit, and Tibetan versions of the Udāna-(varga), [210] where the Buddha’s plan
to go to Vārā�asī also comes as the last in this series of stanzas. [211] It also receives support from a fragment in Tocharian, which records that Upaka inquired about the Buddha’s future plans and the Buddha replied to this question in verse form, indicating his
plan to go to Vārā�asī. [212] Similar to the Madhyama-āgama version, in the Chinese
Dharmapada Avadāna collection the Buddha’s proclamation of his future plans is preceded by a corresponding inquiry by Upaka. [213]
On following these indications, the pattern that emerges would be like this: Upaka
asks after the Buddha’s teacher, in reply to which the Buddha declares the superiority
of his insight and the fact that he has no teacher. Upaka then tries to ascertain if he has
understood properly by inquiring if the Buddha considers himself a conqueror, which
the Buddha affirms. This is followed by Upaka inquiring after the future plans of the
Buddha, in reply to which the Buddha indicates that he is on his way to Vārā�asī in
order to start teaching.
This suggested pattern of events receives support from the Lalitavistara, from the
Sanskrit and Tibetan versions of the corresponding passage in the Sa�ghabhedavastu,
and from the Mahāvastu, according to which the exchange between Upaka and the
Buddha took place in accordance with this pattern. [214]

they were unable to carry out their decision when he actually approached them. [215] The

Jātakanidānakathā explains that the reason for their inability to carry out their previous determination was that the Buddha had been pervading them with mettā when he
was approaching them. [216]
According to the Chinese discourses, the five monks expressed their disbelief in the
Buddha’s awakening only once before being convinced, [217] whereas according to the
Pāli version they gave vent to their disbelief for three times. [218] The three versions also
differ on how the Buddha overcame their distrust.
According to the Majjhima-nikāya version, he convinced them to listen to him by
drawing their attention to the fact that he had never before spoken in such a way. [219] The
Ekottarika-āgama version reports that the Buddha asked the five if they had ever known
him to be speaking a falsehood. [220] According to the Madhyama-āgama version, the Buddha overcame the distrust of the five monks by drawing their attention to the brightness
of his faculties and his manner of bearing, which were unlike the way they had seen
him before, [221] a remark also recorded in the Catu�pari�at-sūtra, in the Lalitavistara,
and in the Sa�ghabhedavastu. [222]
The Madhyama-āgama discourse continues with the Buddha’s first sermon, in which
he presents the noble eightfold path as the middle path aloof from the two extremes of
sensual indulgence and self-mortification. [223]
While the Ariyapariyesanā-sutta does not explicitly mention the Buddha’s first sermon, the Theravāda Vinaya and the Ekottarika-āgama version also record the Buddha’s
first sermon at this point of events. [224] The same is the case for the Catu�pari�at-sūtra,
the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya, the Mahāvastu, and the Sa�ghabhedavastu. [225] The commentary to the Ariyapariyesanā-sutta also indicates that the
first sermon was delivered at this junction of events. [226]
The Ariyapariyesanā-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama and Ekottarika-āgama parallels describe in similar terms that some out of the group of five monks went collecting

alms to support the others, who received instructions from the Buddha, with the final
result that all five became arahants.

MN I 173   The Ariyapariyesanā-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel continue with the Buddha taking up the five types of sensual pleasure, comparing the predicament of being
infatuated with them to a deer caught in snares. In contrast, those who are aloof from
sensual pleasures are, according to both versions, free from Māra’s control, just as a
deer not caught in snares is beyond the hunter’s control.
In the Majjhima-nikāya version it is not entirely clear if this passage is addressed to
the five monks or to the group of monks assembled at Rammaka’s hermitage. According to the Madhyama-āgama presentation, the Buddha addressed this examination of
sensual pleasures to the five monks. [227] Such an instruction to the five monks would be
out of place, however, since before this exposition the Madhyama-āgama version already reports that the five monks had reached full awakening. [228] To warn them of the
dangers of sensual pleasures after they had already eradicated all defilements and
therewith gone forever beyond the attraction of sensual pleasures would be somewhat
beside the point.

MN I 174   The Ariyapariyesanā-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel next take up the four
jhānas. The two versions differ on the identity of the person who attains the four jhānas, which in the Majjhima-nikāya account is a monk in general, while in the Madhyama-āgama version it is the Buddha himself, so that here the attainment of the four
jhānas forms part of an autobiographical account of the Buddha’s awakening. [229] The
Madhyama-āgama discourse continues by describing how, based on having attained
the four jhānas, the Buddha reached the destruction of the influxes. Once he was fully
emancipated in this way, he was able to walk, stand, sit, and lie down freely, comparable to a deer moving about freely in a place that is out of the hunter’s range. The Madhyama-āgama explains that a monk who has reached the destruction of the influxes
would similarly be able to walk, stand, sit, and lie down freely.
The Majjhima-nikāya version instead continues from the four jhānas to the four immaterial attainments and the attainment of cessation, qualifying each of these attainments as a way of blindfolding Māra. The simile of the deer that roams around freely
occurs in the Majjhima-nikāya discourse already at the outset of its exposition of the
jhānas, while a monk’s ability to walk, stand, sit, and lie down freely comes after its
description of the attainment of cessation. [230]
Comparing these two passages, to relate freedom from Māra to the four jhānas and
the destruction of the influxes appears to be more straightforward than making the

same incumbent on the immaterial attainments and cessation. The Majjhima-nikāya
version’s additional reference to the four immaterial attainments and the attainment of
cessation as a way of blindfolding Māra occurs in similar terms in the preceding discourse, the Nivāpa-sutta, where this passage fits the context better than in the present
instance. [231]
Looking back on this last section of the Ariyapariyesanā-sutta and its Madhyamaāgama parallel, it is noteworthy that in both versions this part does not fit too well with
the flow of the narration, coming almost as an anti-climax after the account of the Buddha’s noble quest and full awakening, his subsequent teaching of the five monks, and
their full awakening. [232]
As my comparative study of Majjhima-nikāya discourses up to now has repeatedly
documented, a recurrent feature of orally transmitted discourse material is that, although various passages of a text may be well remembered, at times they are not recalled in their proper sequence. Keeping this feature in mind, it might be worthwhile to
again take up the Madhyama-āgama version’s suggestion that the exposition on the
dangers of sensuality and the subsequent description of the four jhānas was addressed
to the five monks. Although the otherwise similar exposition in the Majjhima-nikāya
version does not address the five monks, it also does not give any explicit indication to
the contrary.
On the assumption that the sequence of the narration might have suffered from a misplacing of this passage during the process of transmission of the discourse, perhaps the
Buddha’s examination of the dangers of sensual pleasures and his subsequent exposition of the four jhānas originally came earlier in the narration, after the first sermon on
the four noble truths, but before the five monks became arahants. If this should have
been the case, then this passage would record what the Buddha taught his first five
monks in order to prepare them for their eventual full awakening. [233]
The Madhyama-āgama version’s indication that this instruction was addressed to the
five monks fits well with the image of the deer caught in snares to illustrate the bondage of sensuality, found in both discourses. According to the Mahāvastu, deer were left
to roam freely in the deer park where the Buddha and the monks were staying. [234] Their


231 [[MN25]] at MN I 159,30 and its parallel [[MA178]] at T I 720a19; cf. also [[AN9.39]] at AN IV 434,12.
232 Pande 1957: 124 notes that “whereas the purpose of the whole sutta is to explain the ‘Noble Quest’
(Ariyapariyesana) ... the paragraph that begins on p. 173 (MN. I) treats abruptly of a different subject –
how the Bhikkhu should avoid the five strands of sensuous desires (Kāmagu�as)”. Abeynayake 2005:
18 notes that “the concluding remarks of the Buddha here are so abrupt that one may come to the conclusion that they were also part and parcel of his address to the group of five monks at the deer park”.
233 Their attainment of full awakening is recorded in [[SN22.59]] at SN III 68,26, which in agreement with its
parallels [[SA34]] at T II 8a3, T 102 at T II 499c26, the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, T 1428 at T XXII 789b2,
the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya, T 1421 at T XXII 105a24, and the Theravāda Vinaya at Vin I 14,34 reports that
the first five monk disciples of the Buddha reached full awakening during a penetrative exposition of
the five aggregates from the perspective of the three characteristics, with particular emphasis given to
the not-self characteristic.
234 According to the Mahāvastu in Basak 1963a: 480,11 or in Senart 1882a: 366,8, the Deer Park owed its


188   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


presence would thus have served as a handy illustration of the freedom to be won by
abandoning sensuality. This makes it natural to locate the delivery of the simile of the
deer caught in snares in the Deer Park by Vārā�asī.
The importance of this image is also reflected in the circumstance that some Pāli editions have the alternative title “discourse on the heap of snares”, instead of “discourse
on the noble quest”. [235] The alternative title “heap of snares” refers to the deer simile in
the passage under discussion at present, a simile apparently considered by the reciters
to be of such significance in relation to the discourse as a whole that it was chosen as a
title.
To place the Buddha’s instructions on sensuality and jhāna at this juncture in the development of the five monks would also fit well from a practical perspective, as the removal of sensuality and the development of deep concentration are important requirements for the progress from stream-entry to full awakening. [236]
An instruction that contrasts the pleasures of sensuality with the pleasures of deeper
concentration would also have weaned the five monks away from their earlier belief in
the need for asceticism in order to reach awakening, due to which they had found it difficult to accept that the Buddha could have reached the final goal after having given up
asceticism.
This would also explain why some out of the group of five monks went begging to
support the others who meanwhile received instructions from the Buddha. If the point
had just been to give them a discourse, there would have been no need to split up the
group.
However, if the five monks had to be taught how to develop jhāna, it would be sensible to divide the group and allow some of them, on alternating turns, the increased de

existence to a grant of immunity given by the king of Vārā�asī in former times to a deer herd whose
leader was the bodhisattva; cf. also the Lalitavistara in Hokazono 1994: 304,25, Lefmann 1902: 19,3 or
Vaidya 1958b: 14,7, and the travelling records of Xuánzàng ( ) in T 2087 at T LI 906b3, translated
in Beal 1884/2001b: 51. An illustration of this tale can be found in Foucher 1955: 110. A similar tale
occurs in Jā 12 at Jā I 145-153 and in T 212 at T IV 685b12; for further parallels cf. Hahn 1983: 1-2.
235 While MN I 175,12 and Ce-MN I 424,33 speak of the Ariyapariyesanā-sutta, Be-MN I 216,1 and Se-MN
I 312,1 have the title Pāsarāsi-sutta. Both titles were apparently well known in commentarial times, as
the commentary on the Majjhima-nikāya at Ps II 163,25 begins by speaking of the Pāsarāsi-sutta,
whereas the Atthasālinī at [[BU-AS35.25]] refers to the same discourse as Ariyapariyesanā, a title mentioned
at Ps II 193,34 only as an alternative to Pāsarāsi-sutta. This slight difference in presentation could be
related to the circumstance that Buddhaghosa appears to have written a draft of the Atthasālinī while he
was still in India, cf. Mahāva�[[SA37]].225 at B [e] -Mhv 243 and Bechert 1955: 355, Law 1973: 407, Malalasekera 1928/1994: 98, Rhys Davids 1900/1922: xxvii, and Norman 1978: 42. Pind 1992: 136-137, 玄奘
however, argues against attributing this work to Buddhaghosa. For a critical review of arguments raised
by Bapat 1942: xxxv-xxxix against identifying Buddhaghosa as the author of the Atthasālinī cf. also
Hayashi 1999.
236 Several discourses indicate that the development of jhāna would be required in order to be able to reach
full awakening, cf. [[MN64]] at MN I 434,25 and MN I 435,26, [[AN9.12]] at AN IV 380,2+17, and [[AN9.36]]
at AN IV 422,7, although it needs to be mentioned that this need has been the topic of some controversy;
for recent contributions relevant to this theme cf. Bodhi 2002, id. 2007, Brahmāli 2007, and Wen 2009.


Chapter 3 Opamma-vagga                                   -  189


gree of seclusion afforded by not having to go begging for alms, so that they could more
easily develop concentrative mastery of the mind. [237]
These considerations would support the assumption that the sequence of the narration
has been misplaced and that the Buddha’s instructions on sensuality and jhāna were indeed given to the five monks. If this assumption should be correct, then the way the
Buddha led his first five monks to full awakening would well exemplify what appears
to be a central pattern underlying the early Buddhist path to liberation, which based on
a penetrative insight into the four noble truths (acquired with stream-entry) requires
overcoming sensuality, developing deeper levels of concentration, and deepening insight into the three characteristics, in order to issue in the attainment of full liberation.


[[MN27]] Cū�ahatthipadopama-sutta

The Cū�ahatthipadopama-sutta, the “lesser discourse on the simile of the elephant’s
footprint”, describes the gradual training of a monk. [238] This discourse has a parallel in
the Madhyama-āgama. [239]
The Madhyama-āgama discourse opens by relating that the wanderer Pilotika visited
the Buddha, received a discourse on the Dharma, and departed full of inspiration about
what he had just heard. On his way back, he met the Brahmin Jā�usso�i.
Unlike the Madhyama-āgama discourse, the Majjhima-nikāya version does not report the earlier visit paid by the wanderer Pilotika to the Buddha. Thus the Cū�ahatthipadopama-sutta begins only with this wanderer meeting the Brahmin Jā�usso�i.
Asked about his impression of the Buddha’s wisdom, [240] according to both versions
the wanderer Pilotika told the Brahmin Jā�usso�i that he had witnessed how different


237 Bronkhorst 1999: 89 notes that the presentation in the Anattalakkha�a-sutta ([[SN22.59]]) gives the impression as if “the mere fact of hearing this wisdom proclaimed is enough for the first disciples of the
Buddha to reach Arhat-ship right there and then. No question of retiring into loneliness, of reaching
subsequently the Four Dhyānas etc., which are elsewhere in the Buddhist texts presented as essential
prerequisites for attaining to this exalted state”. Miyamoto 1965: 851 comments that “the five bhikkhus
probably failed to grasp the full implication of the ... ‘Middle Path’ when it was first presented to them.
Undoubtedly, strenuous effort had to be made before they could become awakened”. Vetter 1985: 74
notes that “the Buddha is so busy instructing the five ascetics that he no longer goes out begging himself ... this account only becomes meaningful to me if I assume that he was initiating these ascetics in
the stages of dhyāna-meditation and was guiding them in a very practical way”. Vetter 1988: xxix further comments that the “middle way not only implied avoiding extremes ... but also the possibility of
perceiving something in the middle that one normally does not observe, i.e. very likely the potential ...
of practising dhyāna-meditation”.
238 According to Mahāva�sa, stanza 14.22 at Be-Mhv 76, the Cū�ahatthipadopama-sutta was the first discourse preached by Mahinda to the king of Ceylon, leading to the king’s conversion and to the spread
of Buddhism in Ceylon.
239 The parallel is [[MA146]] at T I 656a-658a, which agrees with [[MN27]] on Jeta’s Grove by Sāvatthī as the
location and has the title “discourse on the simile of the elephant’s footprint”,, thereby differing from [[MN27]] only in that it does not qualify the discourse to be a “lesser” version. On some aspects
of [[MA146]] cf. Minh Chau 1964/1991: 99-100 and 206.

debaters had been unable to defeat the Buddha in discussion. [241] The Majjhima-nikāya
version stands alone in reporting that these debaters also became the Buddha’s disciples, and that some of them even went forth, practised diligently, and attained awakening. [242]
In both versions, the wanderer Pilotika compared his confidence in the Buddha to a
hunter who, on seeing the big footprint of an elephant, is confident that the elephant in
question must be a large one. Once their conversation was over, the Brahmin Jā�usso�i
went to visit the Buddha and reported how the wanderer Pilotika had illustrated his confidence in the Buddha with the simile of the elephant’s footprint.

MN I 178   According to both versions, the Buddha took up the simile of the elephant’s footprint
and delivered an account of the gradual training in his teaching as an illustration of the
full implications of this simile. The descriptions of the main steps of this gradual training resemble each other in the Pāli and Chinese versions. [243]
A few minor differences are: In its description of abstention from killing, the Madhyama-āgama version explicitly indicates that this also covers killing insects. [244] Moreover,
in its account of other aspects of virtuous conduct, the Madhyama-āgama version mentions abstaining from alcohol, an aspect of conduct not explicitly taken into account in
the Majjhima-nikāya version. [245] Another difference is that, in its treatment of speech,


240 An introductory narration showing some similarities to the exchange between Pilotika and Jā�usso�i
can be found in [[AN5.194]] at AN III 237,2, involving the Brahmins Pi�giyānī and Kāra�apālī.

Pilotika refers to the Buddha as, a standard way of rendering bhagavā, cf., e.g., Hirakawa 1997:

245 [[MA146]] at T I 657b18: . The need to abstain from alcohol is taken into account in the Pāli
discourses in the context of listings of the five precepts, e.g., [[DN5]] at DN I 146,20 (with its monastic
counterpart in pācittiya 51 at Vin IV 110,13, on which cf. also Kieffer-Pülz 2005b). The dire consequences of such consumption are depicted in [[AN8.40]] at AN IV 248, 蜫蟲 9 to be rebirth in hell, as an animal, as a ghost, or as a mentally deranged human. Whereas a description of ethical restraint as part of
the gradual path in the Sa�ghabhedavastu, Gnoli 1978a: 233, also does not refer to the consumption of
alcohol, the same is taken into account in a gradual path account in [[DA20]] at T I 83c27. Nattier 2003a:
109 note 11 points out that variations in regard to references to abstaining from alcohol can occur even
within a single work, such as the Mahāvastu. In one passage in this work, a listing of the ten courses of
action, karmapatha, includes the prohibition against alcohol, at the cost of omitting a reference to harsh
speech; in another passage in the same work, the ten courses are listed without a reference to alcohol, 離酒, 斷酒


Chapter 3 Opamma-vagga                                   -  191


the Madhyama-āgama version provides a contrast to rough speech by depicting a type
of speech that is soft and mild, whereas the Majjhima-nikāya version only portrays the
nature of rough speech. [246 ]
Forms of conduct to be avoided that are mentioned only in the Majjhima-nikāya version are:

 - accepting raw meat,

 - going on messages,

 - buying and selling,

 - cheating with false weights and measures, etc.,

 - deception and fraud, etc.,

 - murder and robbery, etc. [247]
According to both versions, even the attainment of the four jhānas, although constituting a significant verification of the efficacy of the Buddha’s teaching and thus
being a “footprint of the Tathāgata”, [248] is not yet sufficient for acquiring firm confidence in the Buddha as a fully awakened teacher.
While the Majjhima-nikāya version’s account of the gradual training culminates in
the three higher knowledges, the Madhyama-āgama discourse proceeds from the attainment of the fourth jhāna directly to the destruction of the influxes. [249] This presentation is noteworthy, since standard descriptions of the gradual path in the Pāli discourses
usually mention the whole set of three higher knowledges, or even the six higher knowledges.
From a practical perspective, however, to proceed from the attainment of the fourth
jhāna directly to the destruction of the influxes would be possible, as the early discourses do not consider recollection of past lives and the ability to directly perceive the

abstention from alcohol is highlighted in the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya, according to which lack of restraint in this respect endangers keeping the other precepts as well, cf. Abhidh-k 4.34 in Pradhan 1967:

it is clear that the Buddha did not approve of alcohol and drugs, abstinence from intoxicants ... in the

rough speech as asamā[dh]i[sa]�[va]r[dhan]ī. Although in the Pāli discourses this particular consequence of rough speech is not mentioned in accounts of the gradual path, it is taken into account in expositions of the ten courses of action (kammapatha), cf., e.g., [[MN41]] at MN I 286,37.

ments for the destruction of the influxes. Yet, in the present instance the Buddha is describing his teaching to a Brahmin visitor. In view of this, it would fit the context well
if he were to bring in all of the three higher knowledges (tevijjā), thereby describing
what constitutes the Buddhist counterpart to the three knowledges valued by contemporary Brahmins. [250]
Another difference between the two versions is that the Cū�ahatthipadopama-sutta
presents insight into the four noble truths as the way to reach complete confidence,
while the successful destruction of the influxes is the point at which complete confidence has been reached. [251] The Madhyama-āgama version does not have such a distinction, but simply treats insight into the four noble truths and the destruction of the
influxes together. [252]
According to the commentarial explanation, the finer distinction introduced at this
point refers to the difference between path and fruition attainment, since at the path
moment the noble disciple is about to reach complete confidence, whereas with the
fruition moment of full awakening he has completely done so. [253]
Yet, according to the standard commentarial presentation already the path moment
eradicates the defilements. [254] Thus, the commentarial explanation does not seem to fit
the passage it purports to explain so well, as in the Cū�ahatthipadopama-sutta the eradication of the influxes takes place only at the point that according to the commentary
would represent the fruition moment of an arahant.

MN I 184   The Cū�ahatthipadopama-sutta and its parallel conclude by reporting that the Brahmin Jā�usso�i felt inspired enough by this discourse to take refuge with the Buddha. [255]


250 In [[AN3.58]] at AN I 163,8 a Brahmin proposes tevijjā to stand for knowledge of the three Vedas, in reply to which the Buddha describes what are the three knowledges in his dispensation, concluding that
the attainment of these three higher knowledges makes one a “three-knowledge Brahmin”, [[AN3.58]] at
AN I 165,31: etāhi tīhi vijjāhi, tevijjo hoti brāhma�o. Cf. also Sv I 267,30, according to which the Brahmin Amba��ha took even the expression “knowledge” on its own to represent knowledge of the three
Vedas, vijjā nāma tayo vedā. For a modern interpretation of the three higher knowledges cf. Bucknell
1983.
251 [[MN27]] at MN I 183,34 indicates that with insight into the four noble truths in relation to dukkha and in
relation to the influxes, the noble disciple has not yet reached complete confidence, but is in the process
of doing so, na tveva tāva ariyasāvako ni��ha� gato hoti, api ca kho ni��ha� gacchati, whereas once
the three influxes are eradicated, he has reached complete confidence, [[MN27]] at MN I 184,6: ni��ha�
gato hoti (here and above S [e] -MN I 348,3 reads ni��ha�gato).

253 Ps II 217,24.
254 For the case of stream-entry cf. [[BU-AS234.2]] and Vism 675,4.
255 Instead of continuing to address the Buddha by his name Gotama, [[MA146]] at T I 658a22: when
Jā�usso�i takes refuge as a lay disciple he changes to the honorific “Blessed One”, [[MA146]] at T I
658a23: . In [[MN27]] at MN I 184,11, however, he keeps on using the Buddha’s name even after
taking refuge. This is the usual pattern adopted by Brahmins in other discourses in the Majjhima-nikāya,
who continue to use bho gotama even when they take refuge as lay disciples, cf. e.g., [[MN30]] at MN I
205,4, [[MN60]] at MN I 413,21, [[MN93]] at MN II 157,18, [[MN95]] at MN II 177,11, [[MN96]] at MN II 184,21,

[[MN28]] Mahāhatthipadopama-sutta

The Mahāhatthipadopama-sutta, the “greater discourse on the simile of the elephant’s
footprint”, presents a detailed investigation of the four noble truths, given by Sāriputta.
This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama. [256]
The Mahāhatthipadopama-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama counterpart begin by comparing the role of the four noble truths in regard to all wholesome (or skilful) states to
the footprint of an elephant, which due to its size comprises the footprints of all other
animals. [257]


Wagle 1966: 46 explains that Brahmins “in addressing the Buddha ... invariably use the term bho Gotama”, adding that “bho, which is a term used among brāhma�as when addressing each other, denotes
equality”. Another noteworthy example for the use of bho gotama is the case of the Brahmin Brahmāyu, who according to [[MN91]] at MN II 145,19 used the address bho gotama even after he had prostrated
in front of the Buddha and kissed the Buddha’s feet, an expression of humility that caused an uproar in
the assembly that was witnessing this act. Similar to [[MN27]] [[MN4]] at MN I 24,2 reports that Jā�usso�i
took refuge by using the address bho gotama, whereas in the Chinese parallel [[EA31.1]] at T II 666c27 he
used the address “Blessed One”, followed, however, in [[EA31.1]] at T II 666c29 by Jā�usso�i reverting
to the name Gotama. Perhaps the occurrences of the address “Blessed One” in [[EA31.1]] and in [[MA146]]
could be due to the reciters or translators assuming that someone who takes refuge must be using a
honorific form of address like “Blessed One”. Another difference is that [[MA146]] at T I 658a26 concludes with Jā�usso�i and Pilotika rejoicing in the Buddha’s exposition, whereas according to [[MN27]]
at MN I 184,10 only Jā�usso�i rejoiced in the Buddha’s exposition. The course of the narration in both
versions gives the impression that Jā�usso�i had come alone to visit the Buddha, whereas Pilotika had
already received an inspiring discourse from the Buddha and was on his way back to Sāvatthī when he
met Jā�usso�i. Thus the conclusion in [[MN27]] would fit the situation better. It seems to be a recurrent
pattern in Madhyama-āgama discourses that the conclusion reports the delight of those who at this junction of events have already left, cf. also below p. 209 note 31 and p. 545 note 83.
256 The parallel is [[MA30]] at T I 464b-467a, which agrees with [[MN28]] on locating the discourse at Jeta’s
Grove by Sāvatthī and also has the similar title “discourse on the simile of the elephant’s footprint”,
, thereby differing from [[MN28]] only in that it does not use the specification “greater”. A study
and partial translation of [[MA30]] can be found in Minh Chau 1964/1991: 113-114. For a discourse quotation in Abhidh-k-� cf. below note 259. For a counterpart to MN I 191,18-19 in Vyākhyāyukti literature
cf. Skilling 2000b: 343.
257 In regard to this simile, Cousins 1996a: 146 comments that “when ... Sāriputta tells us that all skilful
dhammas are included in the four noble truths, we should ... interpret skilful dhammas here as referring
to meditational states”. According to Ñā�aponika 1966/1981: 2, the image in [[MN28]] intends to convey
that “the Four Noble Truths comprise ... all that is beneficial, i.e. all that is truly worth knowing and
following after”. On the term kusala and its implications cf. also Adam 2005, Carter 1984, Collins
1998: 154, Del Toso 2007b, Nanayakkara 1999, and Premasiri 1976. Franke 1906: 368 notes that a 象
跡喻經 counterpart to the simile of the elephant’s footprint can be found in the Mahābhārata, where it illustrates the importance of non-violence, ahi�sā; cf. also Neumann 1896/1995: 1141 note 451. The simile
of the elephant’s footprint recurs in [[SN48.54]] at SN V 231,2 to highlight the importance of the faculty
of wisdom, paññindriya. Since insight into the four noble truths is reckoned a manifestation of the faculty of wisdom (cf. [[SN48.10]] at SN V 199,2), the use of this simile in [[SN48.54]] is similar to its implications in [[MN28]] The simile of the elephant’s footprint can also be found in [[SN3.7]] at SN I 86,29 (or
SN [2] 128 at SN [2] I 195,16) and its parallel [[MA141]] at T I 647c6, [[SN45.140]] at SN V 43,13, [[AN6.53]] at
AN III 364,21, [[AN10.15]] at AN V 21,18, [[SA882]] at T I 222a5, and SĀ [2] 66 at T II 396b27. In each of



MN I 184


194   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


MN I 185   The Mahāhatthipadopama-sutta and its parallel proceed from the topic of the four
noble truths to the first noble truth, then to the five aggregates mentioned in the first
noble truth, then to the aggregate of form, and then to the four elements as the basic
constituents of form. [258]
Taking up the earth element, the parallel versions distinguish between its internal and
external manifestations, followed by defining the internal earth element by way of the
solid parts of the human body. [259]
The Majjhima-nikāya version explains that the internal and the external earth element should be contemplated as “not mine, not I, not my self”, in order to develop disenchantment. [260] The Madhyama-āgama version does not have such an instruction at
this point, although the same theme is taken up later on in both versions (see table 3.5).
The two versions continue by turning to the destruction of the whole earth, which according to Indian cosmology occurs periodically. Both versions conclude that once
even the great earth is impermanent, the physical body must be of the same nature.
While the Majjhima-nikāya version highlights that it is meaningless to identify with
the impermanent body, [261] the Madhyama-āgama version tackles the same theme by contrasting an unlearned worldling, who identifies with the body, with a learned disciple,
who is aloof from such identification. [262]
The Mahāhatthipadopama-sutta and its parallel continue by examining the case of a
monk who meets with abuse, recommending the reflection that such unpleasant experiences arise in dependence on contact, which, just as the four immaterial aggregates, is
impermanent. In both versions, such reflection leads to mental steadiness. [263]
While the Majjhima-nikāya version only takes up the case of abuse, the Madhyamaāgama discourse also examines the case of experiencing pleasant speech, recommend

these cases, the simile illustrates the importance of diligence, appamāda. Another occurrence of the same
simile is [[SA270]] at T II 70c15, where it illustrates the importance of perception of impermanence.
258 A minor difference in regard to the definition of the first noble truth is that “disease” and “association
with what is disliked” together with “dissociation from what is liked” are only mentioned in [[MA30]] at
T I 464b29, while “sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair” are only mentioned in [[MN28]] at MN I
185,4 (cf. also above p. 69).
259 A discourse quotation in Abhidh-k 3:28 in Pradhan 1967: 136,19 and 137,2 parallels the listing of hair,
etc., as manifestations of the earth element in [[MN28]] at MN I 185,15; with its counterparts in T 1558 at
T XXIX 50a14, T 1559 at T XXIX 207a7, and Abhidh-k-� at D (4094) mngon pa, ju 140b6 or Q (5595)

262 [[MA30]] at T I 464c15.
263 According to [[MN28]] at MN I 186,4, the mind “goes forward and become satisfied, steadied, and determined”, pakkhandati pasīdati santi��hati adhimuccati (S [e] -M I 351,5 reads vimuccati, instead of adhimuccati, a reading that, as Ñā�aponika 1966/1981: 22 notes, is also found in the subcommentary B [e] -Psp� II 169; on alternations between these two terms cf. Lévi 1929: 44 and Wynne 2007: 79; cf. also below p. 685 note 14). [[MA30]] at T I 465a3 instead speaks of the “tranquil, concentrated, and unified mind”,
.

Chapter 3 Opamma-vagga                                   -  195


ing the same type of reflection (see table 3.5). [264] In this way, the Madhyama-āgama
version commends mental steadiness not only when a monk is confronted with abuse,
but also when he meets with pleasant words, in which case reflecting on their impermanent nature would prevent the arising of pride and conceit.
Both versions turn to the case of being physically attacked, recommending the reflection that to come into contact with physical harm is simply the nature of this body. The
two versions continue by quoting the simile of the saw as a reminder for the need for
patience in case one is physically attacked. [265] The Madhyama-āgama version stands
alone in following the simile with instructions on the development of loving kindness
as a boundless radiation in all directions (see table 3.5). [266] The Kakacūpama-sutta and
its parallel, from which the simile originates, also follow their exposition of the simile
with such instructions. [267]


Table 3.5: Reflections on the Elements in [[MN28]] and its Parallel

The Mahāhatthipadopama-sutta and its parallel agree that recollecting the simile of
the saw is an instance of recollection of the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sa�gha. By
undertaking such recollection, a monk should be able to establish himself in equanimity, failing which he should arouse a sense of urgency. Such arousal is illustrated in
both versions with the urgency experienced by a daughter-in-law in regard to her new
family members, such as her father-in-law, or else her husband. [268]

[[MA30]] at T I 464c11, T I 465b1, T I 465c20, and T I 466b13 also appears to provide a relation between the practice of the four brahmavihāras and the earlier contemplation of the elements, since it qualifies each element to be “without hostility”, . This could be similar to an exposition found in [[MN62]] at MN I 423,20, where the way each element patiently bears with whatever
dirt is put on or into it functions as an inspirational example for developing the brahmavihāras.
267 [[MN21]] at MN I 129,15 and [[MA193]] at T I 746a13.
268 Coomaraswamy 1943: 174 takes up this simile as one of the illustrations of sa�vega, which he explains
to stand for a “state of shock, agitation, fear, awe, wonder or delight induced by some physically or
mentally poignant experience” (p. 176).

MN I 186


196   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


MN I 187   Both versions apply the same treatment and reflections to the other three elements of
water, fire, and wind. While the Mahāhatthipadopama-sutta and its parallel proceed
along similar lines when depicting the internal manifestations of each element, they
differ in regard to the external manifestations of the four elements (see table 3.6).


Table 3.6: Destruction of the Four Elements in [[MN28]] and its Parallel

|[[MN28]]|[[MA30]]|
|---|---|
|water element disturbed, earth disappears (1)<br>water element disturbed, destroys villages,<br>etc., then dries up (2)<br>fire element disturbed, destroys villages,<br>etc., then runs out of fuel (3)<br>wind element disturbed, destroys villages,<br>etc., then disappears (4)|water calamity destroys earth element (→ 1)<br>fire calamity destroys water element (→ 2)<br>fire arises and destroys villages, etc., reaches<br>road or water and runs out of fuel (→ 3)<br>wind arises and destroys houses, trees, etc.,<br>reaches mountain and stops (→ 4)|



When taking up the destruction of the external earth element, the Pāli version describes how the water element, on being disturbed, destroys the earth element. [269] When
turning to the external water element, however, the Mahāhatthipadopama-sutta again
speaks of the water element being disturbed, a disturbance that results in the destruction of villages and whole countries through floods. [270] The Pāli account continues its
treatment of the external water element by describing how the water of the great ocean
dries up in stages until none is left.
When it comes to the external fire element and the external wind element, the Mahāhatthipadopama-sutta describes the effects of a disturbance of the fire element and then
of the wind element, so that in these two cases, just as in the case of water, it attributes
the destruction of a particular element to a disturbance of the same element. [271]
In this way, the Pāli presentation speaks twice of a disturbance of the water element
and does not mention a disturbance of the earth element. [272] Its exposition of the earth


269 [[MN28]] at MN I 185,28: bāhirā āpodhātu pakuppati.
270 [[MN28]] at MN I 187,15: bāhirā āpodhātu pakuppati.
271 [[MN28]] at MN I 188,16: bāhirā tejodhātu pakuppati and MN I 189,1: bāhirā vāyodhātu pakuppati.
272 Be-MN I 243,30 records a variant reading according to which the destruction of the earth is not due to a
disturbance of the water element, but to a disturbance of the earth element (reading pathavīdhātu pakuppati instead of āpodhātu pakuppati). On this reading, the presentation would become more uniform,
with a disturbance of each element being responsible for its own destruction. Horner 1954/1967: 232
note 1 suggests a similar emendation for this passage. The commentary, Ps II 224,8, however, glosses
the destruction of the earth by describing how the earth is flooded and submerged in water, an explanation clearly based on the reading that the water element is disturbed. If the reading known to the commentators had been a disturbance of the earth element, one would expect the commentary to describe
earthquakes, etc. That the commentarial tradition did not conceive of a disturbance of the earth element
can also be seen in Vism 414,13, which explains that a world contraction can be due to water, fire, and
wind, āposa�va��o, tejosa�va��o, vāyosa�va��o, thereby not taking account the possibility that such a
contraction might occur due to the earth element.


Chapter 3 Opamma-vagga                                   -  197


element is, moreover, rather brief and differs from the way the other three elements are
treated, where in each case the Pāli version offers a detailed description of the destruction caused by the disturbance of this element, followed by depicting the disappearance
of the respective element.
The Chinese version differs in as much as it attributes the destruction of each element
to another element, although here, too, the exposition of the destruction of the first two
elements is rather brief. It agrees with the Pāli presentation that the external earth element is destroyed by water, but then continues by describing that the external water
element dries up due to a fire. The external fire element comes to an end when a fire
conflagration reaches a road or water and runs out of fuel. A storm as a manifestation
of the external wind element comes to an end on reaching the mountains, representative of the earth element. [273]
The Chinese version’s attribution of the destruction of the external water element to
the impact caused by fire reminds of a discourse from the A�guttara-nikāya which, together with its parallels in the Madhyama-āgama and the Ekottarika-āgama, describes
the gradual drying up of the great ocean in similar terms as the Mahāhatthipadopamasutta. [274] According to these discourses, the cause for such a drying up of the ocean is
the arising of several suns, an event which would be a manifestation of the fire element.
Yet another discourse from the A�guttara-nikāya attributes even a drought to a disturbance of the fire element. This discourse lists five causes for drought, one of which
is when the element of fire in the sky is disturbed, whereby the clouds are dispersed
and there will be no rain. [275] These passages accord with the attribution of the destruction of the external water element to the impact caused by fire, proposed in the Madhyama-āgama parallel to the Mahāhatthipadopama-sutta.
The Mahāhatthipadopama-sutta and its parallel continue by comparing the nature of MN I 190
the body to a house, explaining that both are merely space, the one enclosed by skin
and bones and the other enclosed by timber and clay. [276]
The two versions next turn to the dependent nature of consciousness, which arises in
dependence on a sense-base and its object. The Madhyama-āgama discourse takes up
two cases, where either consciousness arises or, lacking the required conditions, does
not arise. [277] The Majjhima-nikāya account examines three cases by differentiating the


273 [[MA30]] at T I 464c12, T I 465b2, T I 465c20, and T I 466b14.
274 [[AN7.62]] at AN IV 101,19, [[MA8]] at T I 429a2, and [[EA40.1]] at T II 736b13; cf. also SHT VII 1678aR, a
Schøyen fragment, and a Tibetan parallel (from Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya) in Dietz 2007. A similar description can also be found in the Śik�āsamuccaya in Bendall 1902/
1970: 247,10.
275 [[AN5.197]] at AN III 243,4+8 uses the same verb pakuppati, “to disturb”, as [[MN28]] at MN I 185,28. The
other four causes are a disturbance of the wind element, interference by the asura king, indolence of the
devas responsible for rain, and evil conduct among humans.
276 [[MN28]] at MN I 190,15 and [[MA30]] at T I 466c29; cf. also the Śrāvakabhūmi in Shukla 1973: 386,13 or
ŚSG 2009: 40,7 and T 1579 at T XXX 454c25.
277 [[MA30]] at T I 467a3. In its examination of the second case, [[MA30]] at T I 467a12+14 shows some internal inconsistencies, as in relation to the sense-objects (of the ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind) it speaks


198   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


case that consciousness does not arise into two possibilities, where either no objects are
present or else no contact is established. [278] In both instances, lacking one of the required
conditions, consciousness does not arise.
The two versions relate the dependent arising of consciousness to the five aggregates,
followed by quoting a statement by the Buddha that one who sees dependent arising
sees the Dharma, and one who sees the Dharma sees dependent arising. [279]
The Majjhima-nikāya version concludes by explaining that clinging to the aggregates
corresponds to the origin of dukkha, while to remove desire for them equals the cessation of dukkha, thereby coming round to its point of departure, the four noble truths. [280]
The Madhyama-āgama version instead concludes by indicating that detachment from
past, present, and future manifestations of the five aggregates will lead to awakening. [281]


[[MN29]] Mahāsāropama-sutta

The Mahāsāropama-sutta, the “greater discourse on the simile of the heartwood”,
examines the types of achievement that should not be mistaken for the final goal. This
discourse has a parallel in the Ekottarika-āgama, [282] which at the same time is also the
parallel to the next discourse in the Majjhima-nikāya, the Cū�asāropama-sutta.

MN I 192   According to the opening section of the Majjhima-nikāya version, the Buddha delivered the present discourse in relation to Devadatta. [283] The Ekottarika-āgama version
offers more details in this respect. It reports that Devadatta, who by the time of this discourse had lost all his supernormal powers, had gained such favour with King Ajātasattu that the latter was supplying Devadatta and his followers with five hundred meas

of their being illuminated by light,, thereby repeating the description used earlier in relation
to visual forms, the only instance where this description seems appropriate. Another puzzling passage
occurs in [[MA30]] at T I 467a15, where the internal mind-sphere, its objects, and mind-consciousness
that is aware of forms are reckoned together as belonging to the aggregate of form,

ures of food per day. When the monks informed the Buddha about this, according to
the Ekottarika-āgama account the Buddha declared that these material gains would
prevent Devadatta from achieving the goal for the sake of which he had gone forth. [284]
The Mahāsāropama-sutta and its Ekottarika-āgama parallel deliver a simile about
mistaking various parts of a tree, such as its twigs or leaves, for heartwood. [285] A similar
mistake takes place when someone praises himself and disparages others, instead of
making an effort to progress further. According to both versions, such praising oneself
may take place because of:

 - getting material gains, honour, and fame,

 - being of virtuous conduct,

 - having achieved concentration.
The Majjhima-nikāya discourse considers knowledge and vision as another achievement on account of which a monk might become negligent, praise himself, and disparage others, [286] after which it turns to permanent liberation, at which point the “heartwood” has been reached. [287] The Majjhima-nikāya version concludes by stating that the
holy life has neither material gain, nor virtue, nor concentration, nor knowledge and
vision as its ultimate aim, but only unshakeable deliverance of the mind (akuppa cetovimutti). [288]
The Ekottarika-āgama version does not mention knowledge and vision, as its presentation proceeds from describing how a monk achieves concentration to his acquisition of wisdom, at which point the Ekottarika-āgama discourse qualifies such a monk
as first and foremost (see table 3.7). [289]
The Ekottarika-āgama discourse continues with the Buddha answering a question by
one of the monks in relation to Devadatta, followed by stanzas spoken by the Buddha
in praise of liberating wisdom. After these stanzas, according to the Ekottarika-āgama
account the Buddha summed up his exposition by relating greed for material gains to
wrong views. Having wrong views will in turn lead to wrong manifestations of the other

scorn material gains.

The Ekottarika-āgama discourse concludes by reporting that this exposition on the
dangers of succumbing to the attraction of material gains had a strong effect on the
monks, since it caused a group of over sixty monks to disrobe, while another group of
a similar size became arahants. [290] A discourse in the A�guttara-nikāya and its counterparts in the Madhyama-āgama and the Ekottarika-āgama report a similar outcome for
another discourse given by the Buddha, which vividly illustrates the dire consequences
incurred by a monk who engages in evil conduct. [291]


[[MN30]] Cū�asāropama-sutta

The main contents of the Cū�asāropama-sutta, the “lesser discourse on the simile of
the heartwood”, are similar to the preceding Mahāsāropama-sutta. Both Pāli discourses
have the same Ekottarika-āgama discourse as their parallel, so that much of what has
been said above concerning the Mahāsāropama-sutta applies equally to the present
discourse.

MN I 198   The Cū�asāropama-sutta takes its occasion from a visiting Brahmin who had asked
the Buddha if the claim of any of the six heretical teachers to having realized direct
knowledge was justified. [292] Putting aside this question without directly answering it,
the Buddha employed the simile of the heartwood to illustrate that material gains, vir

290 [[EA43.4]] at T II 759c26 reports that the second group of over sixty monks attained the extinction of the
influxes (viz. they became arahants) and the Dharma-eye (viz. they became stream-enterers),
. Perhaps this should be understood to indicate that the present
discourse had so powerful an effect as to enable them to progress from the level of worldlings through
stream-entry all the way up to full awakening.
291 [[AN7.68]] at AN IV 135,5, [[MA5]] at T I 427a3, and [[EA33.10]] at T II 689c1 conclude with sixty monks
disrobing and sixty monks becoming arahants, an outcome also reported at the conclusion of [[EA43.5]]
at T II 761b11.
292 [[MN30]] at MN I 198,7. The Mahāparinibbāna-sutta and several of its Chinese parallels report that the
wanderer Subhadda approached the Buddha with a similar inquiry regarding the six well-known contemporary teachers, cf. [[DN16]] at DN II 150,26, [[DA2]] at T I 25a19, T 6 at T I 187b21, T 7 at T I 203c24,
and [[SA979]] at T II 254b2. 復有六十

tuous conduct, concentration, and knowledge and vision should not be considered the
final goal of the spiritual life.
A major difference between the two Pāli versions occurs at this point. Whereas the
Mahāsāropama-sutta simply speaks of permanent liberation, the Cū�asāropama-sutta lists as superior and more sublime than knowledge and vision the following:

 - the first jhāna,

 - the second jhāna,

 - the third jhāna,

 - the fourth jhāna,

 - the attainment of the sphere of infinite space,

 - the attainment of the sphere of infinite consciousness,

 - the attainment of the sphere of nothingness,

 - the attainment of the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception,

 - the attainment of the cessation of perceptions and feelings. [293]
Except for the reference to the cessation of perceptions and feelings, with its explicit
relation to the destruction of the influxes, this passage is puzzling. The four jhānas and
the four immaterial attainments belong to the category of “concentration” and thus
would have already been covered in the previously mentioned “accomplishment of
concentration” (samādhisampadā). [294] In fact, apart from the four jhānas and the four
immaterial attainments, it would be difficult to conceive of what else that could be
reckoned an “accomplishment of concentration”.
Yet, at an earlier point of its exposition the Cū�asāropama-sutta considers this accomplishment of concentration as something to be left behind in order to proceed to knowledge and vision, and therefore as something inferior to knowledge and vision. Judging
from other discourses, this is in fact the proper hierarchical position for concentration,
which usually leads up to knowledge and vision, but is never superior to it. [295] Thus, to
speak of the four jhānas and the four immaterial attainments as something superior to
knowledge and vision is at odds with other discourses and also with the earlier part of
the same Cū�asāropama-sutta.
The Pāli commentary explains that the four jhānas and the four immaterial attainments are listed as superior to knowledge and vision in the present context because
they lead up to the cessation of perceptions and feelings. [296] This explanation does not
solve the problem, as the Cū�asāropama-sutta explicitly qualifies each jhāna and immaterial attainment individually as “a state superior to and more sublime than knowledge and vision”, [297] whereas for the commentarial explanation to hold true this qualifi

295 E.g., in [[AN5.24]] at AN III 19,22 samādhi leads up to ñā�adassana, which indicates ñā�adassana to be
superior to samādhi.

cation should be applied only to the culmination point of the series, the cessation of
perceptions and feelings.
Another noteworthy point is that although the Cū�asāropama-sutta has the title of
being the “lesser” (cū�a) version of the two Pāli discourses, due to the long exposition
on the four jhānas and the four immaterial attainments it turns out to be longer than its
mahā counterpart. [298] In general the reasons for distinguishing between a “greater” (mahā) and a “lesser” (cū�a) version of a discourse could be due to the importance of the
respective subject. In the present instance, however the two discourses are so similar
that to distinguish them into a greater and a lesser version should refer to their respective length.
In sum, the fact that the four jhānas and the four immaterial attainments have already
been covered in the previously mentioned “accomplishment of concentration”, plus the
fact that other discourses do not consider the jhānas to be superior to knowledge and
vision, and the circumstance that the Cū�asāropama-sutta in its present version is longer
than its Mahāsāropama counterpart, suggest that the passage on the jhānas and the immaterial attainments as states superior to knowledge and vision may be a later addition
to the discourse. [299]


298 Cf. also Pande 1957: 122.
299 Norman 1997: 16 comments that “sometimes the small sutta is larger than the large sutta, and we must
assume that further contraction or expansion has taken place since the suttas received their names”.


## Chapter 4 Mahāyamaka-vagga

[[MN31]] Cū�agosi�ga-sutta

The Cū�agosi�ga-sutta, the “lesser discourse in the Gosi�ga [Grove]”, [1] reports a visit
paid by the Buddha to a group of three monks that live together harmoniously. This
discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama and another parallel in the Ekottarika-āgama, [2] in addition to which another parallel has been preserved in a Gāndhārī
fragment. [3]
The introductory narration of the Cū�agosi�ga-sutta and part of the ensuing exchange
between the Buddha and the monks Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila recurs in the
Upakkilesa-sutta and in the Mahāvagga of the Theravāda Vinaya. [4] The Upakkilesasutta and the Theravāda Vinaya account differ from the Cū�agosi�ga-sutta in regard to
the location, as they take place at the Eastern Bamboo Grove, [5] while the Cū�agosi�gasutta has the Gosi�ga Sāla Grove as its location. [6] Another difference is that in the
Upakkilesa-sutta the three monks have not yet reached the goal, while in the Cū�agosi�ga-sutta they are already accomplished arahants.
Although this suggests that the events described in the Cū�agosi�ga-sutta and the
Upakkilesa-sutta took place on different occasions, the introductory narration shared
by these two discourses gives the impression that they might be reporting the same episode. According to this introductory narration, on arriving at the park, where the three
monks were staying, the Buddha was stopped by the park keeper, who apparently did
not realize that the person in front of him was the teacher of the monks that were dwelling inside the park. [7] Although one may well imagine that the park keeper did not rec

1 Ps II 235,16 explains that the grove was called Gosi�ga after a tree with a branch that had the shape of
the horns of a cow. According to the Mahāvastu in Basak 1963a: 378,3 or in Senart 1882a: 295,15, however, a woman by the name of Goś��gī donated a śālavana to the Buddha and the community, an account
that suggests the grove to have been named after its donor.
2 The parallels are [[MA185]] at T I 729b-731a and [[EA24.8]] at T II 629a-630a (the relevant section is only
part of a longer discourse), both of which agree with [[MN31]] on the location ([[EA24.8]] at T II 629a15 locates the meeting between the Buddha and the group of monks headed by Anuruddha in the Vajjian country,, which corresponds to the area where the Gosi�ga Grove was found). [[MA185]] has the title
“discourse on the Cattle’s Horn Sāla Wood”,, thereby not using the specification “lesser”,

ognize the Buddha on meeting him for the first time, it seems more difficult to imagine
the same happening again. Thus, the narrative introductions to the Cū�agosi�ga-sutta
and the Upakkilesa-sutta give the impression as if both discourses are reporting the
same visit paid by the Buddha to Anuruddha and his companions, even though the subsequent discourses differ from each other.
Further exploring this point, it is noteworthy that the Cū�agosi�ga-sutta begins with
the Buddha asking Anuruddha and his companions if they were lacking anything and if
they were living together in harmony. [8] While in the discourses the first of these two
questions is a standard way of beginning a conversation when the Buddha visits a
monk or a group of monks, the inquiry into their harmonious cohabitation is unusual.
Notably, according to the Upakkilesa-sutta, the meeting between the Buddha and the
three monks took place right after the Buddha had left the quarrelling monks of Kosambī. The monks of Kosambī had been in hot dispute over a minor matter of discipline to such an extent that they were unwilling to let the Buddha settle their conflict.
Their obstinate attitude had made the Buddha leave them and set out wandering on his
own. According to the Ekottarika-āgama parallel to the Cū�agosi�ga-sutta, the Buddha’s visit to Anuruddha and his companions took place right after he had left the quarrelling monks at Kosambī. [9] This would explain the otherwise unusual inquiry about the
harmonious living together of the three monks.
That the Kosambī events form the background of the Cū�agosi�ga-sutta also appears
to be reflected in the use of certain terms and images. Thus in the Cū�agosi�ga-sutta
the Buddha’s inquires after the ‘harmonious’ living together of Anuruddha and his
companions, a term that recurs in a description of a ‘harmonious’ company given in a
discourse in the A�guttara-nikāya. [10] The same A�guttara-nikāya discourse, together
with a Sanskrit fragment parallel, defines a discordant company with the same terms
that the Upakkilesa-sutta uses in relation to the monks of Kosambī. [11]
Another parallelism is that according to some accounts of the Kosambī quarrel the
Buddha told the quarrelling monks that they should live together blending like milk
and water. [12] The image of blending like milk and water recurs in the Cū�agosi�ga-sutta
and its Madhyama-āgama parallel to describe the harmonious cohabitation of Anurud

vened and told the park keeper to let the Buddha enter the park. [[EA24.8]] at T II 629b5 refers to the park
as, perhaps confusing whatever equivalent to si�ga, “horn”, may have been found in the original
text with sīha, “lion”; cf. also below note 32.

dha and his companions. [13] These parallelisms support the explicit indication given in
the Ekottarika-āgama discourse that the visit to Anuruddha and his companions, described in the Cū�agosi�ga-sutta and its parallels, should be placed soon after the Buddha’s unsuccessful attempt to settle the Kosambī quarrel.
The visit to the same group of monks described in the Upakkilesa-sutta would then
have to be placed at an earlier occasion, when these three monks had not yet reached
the level of meditative proficiency attributed to them in the Cū�agosi�ga-sutta. On this
assumption, perhaps, due to an error in the transmission of the Cū�agosi�ga- and Upakkilesa-suttas, the Buddha’s encounter with the park keeper was doubled and came to be
part of the introductory narration to both meetings. As this doubling is found in the
Majjhima-nikāya and in the Madhyama-āgama, it would presumably have taken place
at some time before the Theravāda and the Sarvāstivāda reciter traditions separated
from each other, but already after what became the Ekottarika-āgama reciter tradition
had begun to transmit its version of the Cū�agosi�ga-sutta independently.
Be that as it may, the Cū�agosi�ga-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel report
that, in reply to the inquiry after their communal harmony, Anuruddha informed the
Buddha that they were living together with loving kindness, willing to act in accordance with the wishes of their companions, so that they were as if of one mind. [14]
According to the Majjhima-nikāya version, the Buddha next inquired if the three
monks were living diligently. [15] In reply, Anuruddha described their daily routine. The
Madhyama-āgama and Ekottarika-āgama discourses have a similar description of the
daily routine of the monks as part of their introductory narration (see table 4.1). [16]
When examining this difference in sequence, a description of the monks’ daily routine seems to be an unexpected reply to a question that is concerned with living diligently (appamatta), ardently (ātāpī), and resolute (pahitatta). When these terms occur
together in other Pāli discourses, they usually refer to intensive practice of meditation. [17]

.
14 [[MN31]] at MN I 206,19 and [[MA185]] at T I 730a6. Engelmajer 2003: 42 identifies three main themes in
the description given of the monks: “loving kindness towards others, putting others’ needs before one’s
own, and taking responsibility” (for things that need to be done); cf. also Aronson 1980/1986: 32-34.
15 [[MN31]] at MN I 207,8: kacci pana vo ... appamattā ātāpino pahitattā viharathā ti?
16 [[MA185]] at T I 729c5 and [[EA24.8]] at T II 629a15; a similar daily routine is described in the context of
the pavāra�ā regulation in Vin I 157,10, for the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya counterpart cf. Heirman 2009:
64-66. In Senior Kharo��hī fragment 12, however, such a description is not found at all.
17 The three terms occur frequently when someone requests a short teaching from the Buddha in order to
withdraw into solitary seclusion for intensive practice, cf., e.g., [[MN145]] at MN III 267,9, [[SN13.1]] at SN
合一水乳 II 244,20, [[SN22.159]] at SN III 187,12, [[SN23.23-34]] at SN III 198,17, [[SN35.76]] at SN IV 48,21, [[SN35.86]]

[[AN8.53]] at AN IV 280,15. The same terms form part of the standard description of reaching the destruction of the influxes through such solitary intensive practice, cf., e.g., [[DN8]] at DN I 177,2, [[DN9]] at DN I

In contrast to this usage, the present discourse relates this set of terms to activities like
preparing seats, setting out water, or cleaning up after a meal. This usage to some extent introduces a subtle shift of emphasis from meditation practice to aspects of external conduct.

Although the Madhyama-āgama account does not relate the monk’s daily routine to
living diligently, ardently, and resolute, it nevertheless describes how each monk, once
he has eaten and cleaned up, will take his sitting mat and retire for meditation, a circumstance not mentioned in the Majjhima-nikāya account. [18] The Ekottarika-āgama
version somewhat similarly reports that the monks would sit in a secluded spot with
straight body and mind, set up mindfulness, and contemplate the sublime Dharma. [19]

Chapter 4 Mahāyamaka-vagga                                  -  207


In relation to the regular meeting of the three monks every five days, the Madhyamaāgama version records that they will either converse on the Dharma or else spend this
time together in noble silence. [20] The Majjhima-nikāya account does not envisage the
possibility that they might spend this time in silence and only describes that they pass
their time in conversation on the Dharma. [21]
This in itself minor divergence further reinforces the impression that a subtle difference in emphasis between the Cū�agosi�ga-sutta and its parallels can be discerned,
namely:

 - the Pāli version presents a description of external conduct as the answer to a
question that appears to be concerned with meditation,

 - the Pāli version does not mention the actual practice of meditation in its description of the daily life of the three monks,

 - the Pāli version does not record that the regular meetings held every five days
might be spent in noble silence.
Due to these differences, the presentation in the Cū�agosi�ga-sutta seems to place
more emphasis on external conduct, whereas in the Chinese parallels meditation plays
a more central role. [22]
In contrast, the description of the daily routine of the three monks in the Chinese versions is permeated by a stronger meditative flavour. This stronger meditative flavour
suits the context well, as all versions attribute a range of meditative attainments to these
three monks.
The Cū�agosi�ga-sutta and its parallels continue with Anuruddha reporting the progress of their meditation practice to the Buddha. According to the Pāli and Chinese
versions, the three monks had attained the four jhānas and the four immaterial attainments (see table 4.2). [23] The two Chinese versions add to this that they also had developed the four brahmavihāras. [24] In view of their living together in a spirit of loving
kindness (described in detail in the Majjhima-nikāya and Madhyama-āgama versions),
this suggestion fits the context well.
According to the Majjhima-nikāya and Ekottarika-āgama versions, the three monks
had also attained the cessation of perceptions and feelings, [25] to which the Madhyama

20 [[MA185]] at T I 729c21: . The account in [[EA24.8]] at T II 629a24 is relatively brief
and does not mention the regular meeting of the monks, although it does record that they live together
without breaking out into speech.

I 268,8, C [e] -MN I 498,11, and S [e] -MN I 389,10: sabbarattika�).
22 This reminds of a similar difference in emphasis between [[MN6]] and its parallel, cf. above p. 47.
23 Senior Kharo��hī fragment 12r31-43 covers the first three jhānas, but then continues with the first immaterial attainment, without mentioning the fourth jhāna. The subsequent description of the immaterial attainments appears to be abbreviated, although the circumstance that the first and the fourth are explicitly
mentioned indicates that all four should be understood as implicit in the description.

25 [[MN31]] at MN I 209,22 and [[EA24.8]] at T II 629b25. The same appears to be the case for the Senior Kharo��hī fragment 12r50, although the reference is not fully preserved.

āgama version adds that they had achieved the six supernormal knowledges (abhiññā) as
well. [26]

MN I 210   Once the Buddha had left, according to all versions Nandiya and Kimbila asked Anuruddha how it was that he had declared them to have such lofty attainments even though
they had never told him about these. In reply to this inquiry, Anuruddha explained to
his companions that he had come to know about their attainments through his telepathic powers. The Majjhima-nikāya discourse, the Ekottarika-āgama version, and the
Gāndhārī fragment add to this indication that he had also been informed of their attainments by devas. [27]
The Cū�agosi�ga-sutta and its parallels report that a yakkha approached the Buddha
and proclaimed that the Vajjians were very fortunate to have the Buddha and these three
monks living among them. [28] According to the Majjhima-nikāya and Madhyama-āgama
discourses, as well as the Gāndhārī fragment, the inhabitants of the different celestial
realms of the sensuous sphere up to the Brahmā world repeated this proclamation. [29] In


26 [[MA185]] at T I 730b28. The three discourses qualify the attainments in their respective lists as “superhuman states”, [[MN31]] at MN I 209,19: uttarimanussadhamma, [[MA185]] at T I 730c6:, and [[EA24.8]] at T II 629b27: ; on this term cf. also Anālayo 2008n. In relation to this notion it is noteworthy that Vin III 87,24 (cf. also Vin III 92,32) and Vin IV 24,1 include the four jhānas and the six supernormal knowledges in a list of such superhuman states, but do not mention the attainment of cessation
or the immaterial attainments, even though these attainments would certainly qualify for being reckoned
“superhuman states”. In fact, the attainment of cessation does not appear to be mentioned at all in the
Theravāda Vinaya. In regard to the attainment of cessation, Schmithausen 1981: 249 notes a suggestion
made by Nagasaki, according to which “nirodhasamāpatti originally was nothing but a (metaphorical)
designation for Nirvā�a in terms of meditative concentration”.

28 This yakkha by the name of Dīgha recurs in a listing of eminent yakkhas in [[DN32]] at DN III 205, 人上之法 7. A
reference to his exchange 上人法 with the Buddha, reported in [[MN31]] and its parallels, can be found in the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-(upadeśa-)śāstra, T 1509 at T XXV 225c2, translated in Lamotte 1970a: 1405.

all versions, the Buddha highlighted the great benefit to be gained by recollecting these
three monks. [30]
The Majjhima-nikāya and Ekottarika-āgama discourses conclude with the yakkha’s
delight in the Buddha’s words. According to the Madhyama-āgama version, the three
monks also rejoiced in the Buddha’s words. [31]


[[MN32]] Mahāgosi�ga-sutta

The Mahāgosi�ga-sutta, the “greater discourse in the Gosi�ga [Grove]”, records a
meeting of eminent disciples during which each of them described praiseworthy qualities reflecting his own outstanding traits. This discourse has three Chinese parallels,
two of which are found in the Madhyama-āgama and in the Ekottarika-āgama, while
the third parallel is an individual translation. [32] Besides these three parallels, a few lines
of a version of the present discourse have also been preserved in a Sanskrit fragment. [33]
The Mahāgosi�ga-sutta and its Chinese parallels report how several eminent monks
visited Sāriputta, who welcomed them and asked their opinion about what kind of a
monk would be able to enhance the beauty of the moonlit Gosi�ga Grove.
The four versions agree that Mahāmoggallāna, Mahākassapa, Anuruddha, Revata,
and Ānanda were present on this occasion. [34] In addition to these, the Madhyama-āga

30 While [[MN31]] at MN I 210,35, Senior Kharo��hī fragment 12v17, and [[EA24.8]] at T II 629c21 speak only
of recollecting the monks, [[MA185]] at T I 731a20 also refers to recollecting their way of practice,
. Another difference worthy of note recurs in relation to the Buddha’s praise of the monks, where [[EA24.8]] at T II 630a2 has a reference to the three incalculable aeons of diligent and difficult practice undertaken by the Buddha-to-be in order to reach unsurpassable awakening,
(adopting the,,, and variant instead of ), one of several instances where the
Ekottarika-āgama seems to have incorporated later elements, for further examples cf. Anālayo 2009A.
31 [[MA185]] at T I 731a26. Since according to [[MA185]] at T I 730c14 the Buddha had already left the three
monks, by the time of meeting the yakkha the Buddha would no longer have been in their company. Although the concluding statement in [[MA185]] could be due to a transmission error, it might also be that it
intends to cover the delight experienced earlier by the monks together with the delight experienced subsequently by the yakkha. In fact, in the Madhyama-āgama such references are not unusual and thus need 所行
者 not be cases of inconsistency, cf. also above p. 193 note 255 and below and p. 545 note 83.
32 The parallels are [[MA184]] at T I 726c-729b, [[EA37.3]] at T II 710c-711c, and T 154.16 at T III 80c-82c, a
discourse that according to the information given in the Taishō edition was translated by Dharmarak�a; 如我於三阿僧祇劫所行勤苦,
成無上道 cf. also Boucher 1996: 269. [[MA184]] and [[EA37.3]] agree with [[MN32]] on the location of the discourse. 宋 元 明 聖 勤 懃
Similar to [[EA24.8]] (parallel to [[MN31]] cf. above p. 203 note 7), [[EA37.3]] at T II 710c5 gives the location
as the “Lion’s Park”,, although later on [[EA37.3]] uses the expression “Cow-lion’s Park”,
, e.g., at T II 710c15, counterpart to a reference to the Gosi�gasālavana in [[MN32]] at MN I 216,3. [[MA184]] has the title “discourse on the Cattle’s Horn Sāla Wood”,, thereby not employing the
qualification “greater” used in the title of [[MN32]] [[MA184]] has been studied and translated by Minh Chau
1964/1991: 21, 73, and 251-257.
33 SHT V 1346 (pp. 232-233, cf. also SHT VII p. 293) parallels [[MN32]] at MN I 218-219. Hartmann 1992:

MN I 213   Each of the monks described qualities that mirror his own personal traits. Thus ânan
da spoke in praise of a learned monk who is able to teach the Dharma, Revata commended a monk who retires into seclusion for intensive meditation, and Anuruddha extolled the ability to exercise the divine eye.

According to the _Majjhima-nikàya_ version, Anuruddha illustrated his ability to survey a thousand worlds with the divine eye with the example of surveying a thousand
“wheel-rims” from an upper storey. [36] In the _Madhyama-àgama_ version, he instead describes surveying a thousand “clay bricks” on the ground below. [37] Although the idea of
a wheel-rim may fit as an illustration of a world system, it is a little difficult to imagine


then at T II 710c8 mentions him in its description of the monks that approached Sàriputta. The fact that
Eâ 37.3 reports the presence of six eminent disciples could be why this discourse was included among
the sixes of the _Ekottarika-àgama_ .
35
Mâ 184 at T I 727a1 and T 154.16 at T III 81a2, which in addition to Mahàkaccàna also lists several

other eminent disciples not mentioned in [[MN32]] The Pàli commentary, Ps II 248,9, similarly reports the
presence of other eminent disciples, without, however, giving their names.
36
[[MN32]] at MN I 213,29: _nemimaõóala_, adopting the translation by ¥àõamoli 1995/2005: 308, in accor
dance with the commentarial gloss at Ps II 254,24. Chalmers 1926: 154 translates _nemimaõóala_ as “concentric distances girdling him round”, and Horner 1954/1967: 265 as “concentric circles”.
37
Mâ 184 at T I 727b14: 於下露地有千土墼; cf. also Mâ 80 at T I 554a12: 觀下露地, 見千土墩 (adopt
ing the 宋, 元, and 明 variant 墩 instead of 塹). An illustration of Anuruddha's ability to survey a thousand worlds in another discourse, Sâ 537 at T II 140a2, speaks of seeing “many things”, 種種之物, on
the ground below.


Chapter 4 _Mahàyamaka-vagga_                                     - 211


why someone should spread a thousand wheel-rims on the ground. In contrast, the production of clay bricks requires them to be laid out on the ground for drying in the air,
so that to see a thousand clay bricks spread out on the ground could easily have happened in ancient India. [38]

The other _Ekottarika-àgama_ version and the individual translation also differ in regard to the simile used to illustrate the ability to survey a thousand worlds. The _Ekot-_
_tarika-àgama_ version compares this ability to looking at the sky, while the individual
translation speaks of looking down from a high building and seeing people come and
go. [39] The image used in the individual translation thereby closely resembles the standard illustration for the exercise of the divine eye in the Pàli discourses, which speaks
of standing on a high building and seeing people below who walk on the road and enter
or leave a house. [40] However, since the present context emphasizes the spatial extent of
Anuruddha's exceptional ability, [41] the similes found in the _Majjhima-nikàya_ and the
_Madhyama-àgama_ versions seem more adequate to the occasion, as they compare Anuruddha's ability to survey a thousand worlds with the divine eye to the ability to survey
a thousand objects.

The _Mahàgosiïga-sutta_ next turns to Mahàkassapa. According to all versions, he extolled a monk who has certain exemplary qualities and also encourages others to develop these qualities. The Pàli and Chinese versions differ to some extent on the qualities mentioned by Mahàkassapa (see table 4.4).

According to all versions, Mahàkassapa spoke in praise of contentment and of achieving concentration, wisdom, and liberation. The _Ekottarika-àgama_ version and the individual translation agree with the _Majjhima-nikàya_ presentation that Mahàkassapa mentioned the wearing of rag robes as well as being endowed with virtue and with knowledge and vision of liberation. [42] The _Madhyama-àgama_ version and the individual translation agree with the _Majjhima-nikàya_ discourse that Mahàkassapa also mentioned
being energetic and having few wishes. [43]


38 According to H„rtel 1995: 142, during this period “burnt bricks were not yet in regular use for buildings

in India”, although their use is attested for the Mauryan period, cf. Verardi 2007: 115.
39
Eâ 37.3 at T II 711a3: 觀空中 and T 154.16 at T III 81b9: 從上視下, 悉見所有人民行來, 出入, 進退.

According to the _Mahàvastu_ in Basak 1968/2004: 108,23 or in Senart 1897: 177,6, already before going
forth Anuruddha had been endowed with superior sight. On one occasion, when he was enjoying himself in female company, he immediately noticed that, instead of the usual thousand lamps, only nine-hundred-ninety-nine lamps had been lit.

40
E.g., in [[DN2]] at DN I 83,4.
41
According to [[AN1.75]] at AN I 23,20 and Eâ 4.2 at T II 557b9, Anuruddha was outstanding among the

Buddha's disciples in regard to this quality; cf. also T 1509 at T XXV 247b23, translated in Lamotte
1970a: 1630.
42
[[MN32]] at MN I 214,4+10+15, Eâ 37.3 at T II 711a9+11+12, and T 154.16 at T III 81b17+21+22.
43
[[MN32]] at MN I 214,6+9, Mâ 184 at T I 727c3+5, and T 154.16 at T III 81b18+19. Just as in the case of

the _Madhyama-àgama_ parallel to [[MN24]] (cf. above p. 162), Mâ 184 at T I 726b21 includes right mindfulness in its list, a quality not mentioned in [[MN32]] or in Eâ 37.3. T 154.16 at T III 81b20 lists 定意.
Although according to Brough 1977: 90 Dharmarakùa elsewhere uses the character 意 to render “mind

In regard to Mahàkassapa, it is noteworthy that according to the _Madhyama-àgama_ version Sàriputta addressed Mahàkassapa with “venerable sir”, and Mahàkassapa replied
with “friend”. [45] This would be an anachronism, since according to a passage in the _Mahà-_
_parinibbàna-sutta_ and its Chinese and Sanskrit counterparts these ways of addressing


fulness”, in the present context the expression 定意 seems to stand just for “concentration”, cf. also Karashima 1998: 103.
44
T 154.16 at T III 81b17: 賢聖; cf. also Karashima 1998: 487 on the use of this expression by Dharma
rakùa in the sense of “sagacious and saintly”.
45
In Mâ 184 at T I 727c1 Sàriputta addressed Mahàkassapa with 尊者, “venerable sir”, corresponding to

_bhante_, to which Mahàkassapa replied with 賢者, “friend”, corresponding to _àvuso_ .


Chapter 4 Mahāyamaka-vagga                                  -  213


each other in accordance with seniority were instituted by the Buddha immediately before his passing away, at a time when Sāriputta was presumably no longer alive. [46] According to the Madhyama-āgama parallel to the Mahāgosi�ga-sutta, all of the other
monks addressed Sāriputta with “venerable sir”, to which he replied by using the address “friend”, so that the Madhyama-āgama account presents Mahākassapa as the most
senior of all eminent disciples.
Yet, it appears as if Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna would have ordained earlier than
Mahākassapa. [47] That is, had this mode of address already been in use before the Buddha’s injunction, it should be the reverse of what is found in the Madhyama-āgama
version. The role of being the eldest monk would only seem to suit Mahākassapa at the
time of the so-called first council, when several of the monks mentioned in the present
discourse had apparently passed away and Mahākassapa could indeed have become the
most senior monk. [48] Thus, the use of this mode of address in the Madhyama-āgama version appears to be the outcome of a later change of wording. [49]
The Mahāgosi�ga-sutta next reports that Mahāmoggallāna spoke in praise of the
ability of two monks to reply to each other on questions related to the Dharma, literally
“talk about Abhidharma”, without faltering. [50] Judging from the way other discourses


46 [[DN16]] at DN II 154,8, [[EA42.3]] at T II 752c17, and fragment 501V3 in Waldschmidt 1950: 75.
47 Cf., e.g., T 1425 at T XXII 412c26.
48 Vin II 286,17 reports that Mahākassapa addressed the assembled monks as āvuso sa�gho and was addressed by them as bhante.
49 According to Minh Chau 1964/1991: 21, the present passage in [[MA184]] reflects the attitude of the Sarvāstivāda tradition, which “accepts Mahākassapa as the foremost and highest patriarch ... while the Theravāda tradition ... considers Sāriputta as the foremost and highest Ācariya”.
50 [[MN32]] at MN I 214,24 speaks of abhidhammakathā. The corresponding statement (although attributed
to a different disciple) in [[MA184]] at T I 727b24 similarly refers to “Abhidharma”, . Anderson
1999/2001: 157 suggests that abhidhammakathā stands for “a question-and-answer exchange, a form of
debate among equals which has the capacity to clarify one’s understanding and teaching of dhamma”.
Bodhi in Ñā�amoli 1995/2005: 1226 note 362 points out that even “though the word cannot refer here to
the Pi�aka of that name – obviously the product of a phase of Buddhist thought later than the Nikāyas –
it may well indicate a systematic and analytical approach to the doctrine that served as the original nucleus of the Abhidhamma Pi�aka”. Muck 1980: 19 understands abhidhamma as representing the “essence
of the teaching”, in the sense of “basic essential truths”. Von Hinüber 1996/1997: 64 explains that “the
word abhidhamma occurs in earlier parts of the canon, but without any technical connotation, simply
meaning ‘things relating to the teaching’”; cf. also Geiger 1920: 118, Gethin 2005: 10020, Horner 1941,
Sujāto 2009: 228-230, van Zeyst 1959, and Watanabe 1983/1996: 18-36. Hirakawa 1980: 173 (cf. also 阿毘曇
Sung 1999: 174) notes that in the Mahāsā�ghika tradition the entire “nine-fold canon of the word of the
Buddha ... is referred to as abhidharma”, cf. Roth 1970: 248,17: abhidharmo nāma nava-vidha� sūtrānta� and T 1425 at T XXII 536b21:, with T 1425 at T XXII 281c18 explaining that
the expression “nine types of discourse” stands for the nine a�gas. Watanabe 1983/1996: 27 draws attention to the qualification “profound” or “deep”,, used in [[MA184]] at T I 727b24 to qualify, a
qualification which he takes to indicate that the present context intends “talk on dhammas (they may be
specific doctrines) in the form of question and answers”, in order to reveal “the intrinsic value or the profound theory” of these dharmas. [[BU-AS29.1]] takes up the reference to abhidhammakathā in [[MN32]] as an argument in support of the authenticity of the Abhidhammapi�aka as original Buddha-word.

portray Mahāmoggallāna, this type of ability would not be one of his typical traits. According to the list of eminent disciples found in the A�guttara-nikāya and in its parallel
in the Ekottarika-āgama, Mahāmoggallāna was rather outstanding for his exercise of
supernormal powers. [51] This ability appears to have been considered such a characteristic trait of this great disciple that the Catu�pari�at-sūtra and the Mahāvastu report that
the Buddha already predicted this disciple’s pre-eminence in supernormal powers at the
time of their first meeting, when Mahāmoggallāna approached the Buddha to request
the going forth. [52] Hence it comes as no surprise that in the three Chinese parallels and
in the Sanskrit fragment parallel Mahāmoggallāna extols such supernormal powers instead, describing the ability to magically multiply oneself, to fly through the air, to pass
through solid earth, etc. (see above table 4.3). [53]
That to associate Mahāmoggallāna with such supernormal powers would be a more
fitting version of his pronouncement on this occasion can also be seen in a discourse in
the Sa�yutta-nikāya, which similarly takes the characteristic qualities of several eminent disciples as its theme. This discourse agrees with the Mahāgosi�ga-sutta on associating Ānanda with extensive learning, Anuruddha with the exercise of the divine eye,
and Kassapa with the ascetic practices. [54] Unlike the Mahāgosi�ga-sutta, however, this
Sa�yutta-nikāya discourse associates Mahāmoggallāna with the exercise of supernormal powers, thereby agreeing in this respect with the Chinese and Sanskrit parallels to
the Mahāgosi�ga-sutta.
Regarding the statement in the Mahāgosi�ga-sutta that extols the ability to answer
questions about deeper aspects of the Dharma without faltering, the Madhyama-āgama
version attributes a similar statement to Mahākaccāna (see above table 4.3). [55] Accord

Horner 1941: 309 comments: “Moggallāna is chiefly famed for his psychic powers, and there is little
reason to suppose him to have had gifts of an abhidhamma nature or we should have heard more about
them”; cf. also Gifford 2003 on the importance of psychic powers for the role Mahāmoggallāna assumes
in the Theravāda tradition. Abhidharmic abilities are, however, associated with him in the Sarvāstivāda
tradition. As already noted by Hirakawa 1993/1998: 132, the Abhidharmakośavyākhyā attributes one of
the Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma treatises, the Prajñaptiśāstra, to Mahāmoggallāna, cf. Wogihara 1971b:

learning, while the monks that associated with Anuruddha were, according to SN II 156,6, endowed with
the divine eye, those who associated with Mahākassapa were, according to SN II 156,2, practitioners of
the ascetic practices, and the monks who were associating with Mahāmoggallāna were, according to [[SN14.15]] at SN II 155,31, all of great [supernormal] power, mahiddhika.

ing to the list of eminent disciples found in the A�guttara-nikāya, Mahākaccāna was
outstanding for his skill in explaining short sayings in detail, while the listing of outstanding disciples in the Ekottarika-āgama extols his ability in analysis and teaching. [56]
The most frequent role assumed by Mahākaccāna in the Pāli discourses is as an elucidator of brief sayings, a role in which he figures more as a teacher than as a participant in a discussion. However, at least in one instance Mahākaccāna does feature as a
participant in a discussion with other monks. [57] To speak in praise of two monks engaged in a talk on the Dharma would also fit Pu��a Mantāniputta, who according to
the A�guttara-nikāya’s list of eminent disciples was outstanding as one who delivers
talks on the Dharma, [58] or else Mahāko��hita, who was apparently a frequent participant
in Dharma discussions with other monks.
Although to reply to questions about the Dharma would fit Mahāko��hita even better
than Mahākaccāna, the same statement does fit both of them much better than Mahāmoggallāna. Perhaps, during the process of transmission of the Pāli discourse, the presence of Mahākaccāna was lost, as a consequence of which what was originally his reply ended up in the mouth of Mahāmoggallāna. [59]
According to all versions, Mahāmoggallāna in turn questioned Sāriputta, who spoke
in praise of a monk who has mastery over his own mind, being able to attain whatever
he wishes at any time of the day, comparable to the ability to choose any garment from
a full wardrobe. [60]
The monks then approached the Buddha, who approved each monk’s declaration,
followed by offering his own description of a monk able to enhance the beauty of the
moonlit Gosi�ga Wood. This was a monk who sits down cross-legged with the determination not to change posture until the destruction of the influxes has been attained. [61]
Other discourses indicate that this type of strong determination had been a characteristic trait of the Buddha. [62]

and several other disciples (such as Upāli, Subhūti, Rāhula, etc.) with short statements, which in the case
of Mahākaccāna is concerned with his vision of the four truths, (notably not using the qualification
“noble”, cf. also below p. 803).

A minor difference in relation to this passage is that while according to the Majjhima-nikāya discourse and the individual translation the Buddha spoke only of the determination to attain the destruction of the influxes, according to the Ekottarika-āgama
account he included the successful carrying through of this determination in his description of what qualifies a monk for being able to enhance the beauty of the moonlit
Gosi�ga Wood. [63] Due to this minor difference, the Buddha’s reply not only describes
one of his outstanding personal qualities, but also highlights the supremacy of the destruction of the influxes over all other achievements, thereby rounding off the different
achievements extolled by his disciples.


[[MN33]] Mahāgopālaka-sutta

The Mahāgopālaka-sutta, the “greater discourse on the cowherd”, compares qualities
needed by a cowherd to the qualities required for progress in the Dharma. This discourse has four parallels: one of these is a Pāli parallel among the elevens of the A�guttara-nikāya, [64] while the other three are Chinese parallels, found in the Sa�yukta-āgama, among the elevens of the Ekottarika-āgama, and in the form of an individual translation. [65] Besides these full parallels, a few sections of a version of the present discourse
have also been preserved in Sanskrit fragments. [66] Moreover, a passage similar to the


the Buddha formed the same determination; cf. also [[MA157]] at T I 679c11 and T 212 at T IV 644c14.
The Buddha’s unwavering commitment to keep striving, even if his body should dry up, is also recorded
in [[AN4.1]] at AN I 50,9, in [[SNP3.2]] at [[SNP434]] in the Lalitavistara in Lefmann 1902: 262,3 or Vaidya
1958b: 192,1, in the Mahāvastu in Basak 1965: 332,13 or in Senart 1890: 239,3, in the Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1977: 113,23, and in Bu ston’s “History of Buddhism” in Obermiller 1932/1986: 35. A
discourse quotation in Abhidh-k 2:44 in Pradhan 1967: 71,12 parallels the description of the determination to remain seated until the influxes are destroyed (not necessarily specific to the present instance)
found in [[MN32]] at MN I 219,31, with counterparts in T 1558 at T XXIX 25b12, T 1559 at T XXIX
183c15, and D (4094) mngon pa, ju 68b1 or Q (5595) tu 76b3.
63 [[EA37.3]] at T II 711c21. [[MA184]] at T I 729b22 could be indicating the same, since after referring to the
monk’s determination not to change posture, it reports that the monk did indeed not change posture (cf.
the similar pattern in the Mahāvadāna-sūtra fragment [[SN360]] folio 137R4-5 in Fukita 2003: 18 or in Waldschmidt 1953: 27, which also first records the bodhisattva Vipassī’s determination to refrain from changing posture, followed by reporting that he did indeed not change posture, thereby implicitly indicating
that he stood up from this sitting as a fully awakened Buddha).
64 The Pāli parallel is [[AN11.18]] at AN V 347-353, entitled “the cowherd”, gopāla, according to Be-AN III
546,19 and C [e] -AN VI 674,31, as well as according to the summary verses (uddāna) in E [e] -AN V 358,31
and S [e] -AN V 390,19.
65 [[SA1249]] at T II 342c-343b, [[EA49.1]] at T II 794a-795a, and T 123 at T II 546a-547b. A translation of [[SA1249]] can be found in Anālayo 2010d. According to the information given in the Taishō edition, T 123
was translated by Kumārajīva. Akanuma 1929/1990: 111 suggests “cowherd”,, as a tentative title
for [[SA1249]] T 123 has the title “discourse spoken by the Buddha on the cowherd”, . The
three Chinese versions agree with the Mahāgopālaka-sutta on locating the discourse in Jeta’s Grove
near Sāvatthī; [[AN11.18]] does not specify a location.
66 These are the so far unpublished fragments no. 2380/50b, 2380/51a, and 2380/51b of the Schøyen collection, identified by Klaus Wille, cf. also Chung 2008: 205 (I am indebted to Jens-Uwe Hartmann for

exposition in the Mahāgopālaka-sutta can also be found in the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā(upadeśa-)śāstra. [67]
The Mahāgopālaka-sutta and its parallels enumerate eleven qualities of a cowherd
and then apply these eleven qualities to a monk, first presenting the whole set from the
perspective of detrimental qualities and then from the complementary perspective of
the corresponding beneficial counterparts (see table 4.5). [68]
The Pāli and Chinese versions agree that the first five of these qualities stand for:

  - knowing that the material body is made up of the four elements,

  - knowing the difference between foolishness and wisdom,

  - overcoming unwholesome thoughts,

  - practising sense-restraint,

  - teaching or explaining the Dharma. [69]
Another quality in the Pāli versions is the need to approach learned monks. A difference in this case is that while in the Majjhima-nikāya and A�guttara-nikāya versions
the learned monks to be approached are well versed in the discourses, the Vinaya and
the “summaries” (mātikā), [70] the Sa�yukta-āgama version speaks of being knowledgeable oneself, and that in regard to the discourses, the Vinaya, and the Abhidharma. [71]
This is not an isolated instance, as Chinese Āgama discourses tend to speak of Abhidharma on instances where Pāli discourses refer to “summaries” (mātikā). [72]


kindly providing me with a preliminary draft transliteration of these fragments). The fragments parallel
the exposition of the bad qualities of a monk found at MN I 220-222.
67 T 1509 at T XXV 74a-b, translated in Lamotte 1944/1981: 149-152. The setting of this version differs
from the Pāli and Chinese discourses, as it depicts cowherds approaching the Buddha for advice on how
to properly carry out their work. While Lamotte reconstructs as Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra,
Demiéville 1950/1973: 470 note 1 points out that Mahāprajñāpāramitā-upadeśa-śāstra might be more
appropriate, hence I refer to the work as *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-(upadeśa-)śāstra.
68
The image of a cowherd is of course a familiar one in Indian thought, on its relation to the K���a legend
cf., e.g., Vaudeville 1975. For another listing of eleven qualities of a cowherd cf. T 201.61 at T IV 317b21
and Lévi 1908: 140-144.
69 Fragment no. 2380/50bc of the Schøyen collection differs from the other versions in as much as it lists
evil friendship as one of the bad qualities of a monk: bhik�u� pāpamitro bhavati pāpasahāyo. Fragment
no. 2380/51ac-d of the Schøyen collection does, however, agree with the other versions on the overall
count of eleven qualities.
70 [[MN33]] at MN I 221,22 and [[AN11.18]] at AN V 349,16. T 1509 大智度論 at T XXV 74a28 only refers to these elder
monks as “expounders of the Dharma”, .
71 [[SA1249]] at T II 343a11: . [[EA37.3]] at T II 794b14 instead lists the twelve a�gas. Notably, the
*Mahāprajñāpāramitā-(upadeśa-)sāstra has a version of this quality that is close to the presentation in
the Pāli discourses, T 1509 at T XXV 74a28: “[he] is able to approach learned monks to inquire about
the Dharma”,
72 Other occurrences of the term mātikā can be found in [[DN16]] at DN II 125,7, [[AN5.25]] at AN I 117,29,
[[AN8.7]] at AN II 147,29, [[AN4.180]] at AN II 169,18, [[AN5.156]] at AN III 179,2, [[AN6.51]] at AN III
361,24, [[AN10.11]] at AN V 16,1, and [[AN11.18]] at AN V 349,16. In regard to these occurrences, if there
are Chinese parallels at all, these do not mention the term mātikā. This finding may at first sight seem to
corroborate the remark made by Anesaki 1901: 898 that “we find no mention of this term in the Chinese
Āgamas”. This does, however, not appear to be entirely the case, as the parallels to [[MN104]] [[MA196]] at 說法者

This difference in terminology need not imply a major difference in meaning, since
the development of the Abhidharma might be related to such “summaries”, in the sense


T I 755a17 and T 85 at T I 906a18, do refer to the mātikās as and, although in this case
mātikās are not mentioned in the Pāli version. It would be easily understandable if Anesaki should have
overlooked this instance, since on coming across the expression, literally “mother”, one would
hardly expect it to render whatever equivalent to mātika was found in the original text; cf. also Bapat
1968: 364. Apart from the Āgamas, the mātikās or māt�kās occur regularly in the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda
Vinaya, cf. Dutt 1984b: 173,8, id. 1984c: 122,4, id. 1984d: 97,13, Gnoli 1978b: 3,19, 44,16, and 71,6,
translated in Schopen 2000: 101 as “summary”, T 1451 at T XXIV 408b6:, and its Tibetan
counterpart ma lta bu in Waldschmidt 1951: 243,5, as is also the case for the Divyāvadāna in Cowell
1886: 18,15 and 333,7 or Vaidya 1999: 11,17 and 206,10 (notably, a reference to the eight māt�kāpadāni
in the Ka�hinavastu in Chang 1957: 58,8 has as its Chinese counterpart in T 1449 at T XXIV 98c11 just
, while the Tibetan translation reads ma mo’i gzhi; cf. Chang 1957: 114, 母者 摩怛里迦 21). Hirakawa 1993/1998:
142 explains that “the term ‘māt�kā’ is still preserved in the treatises of the Theravāda Abhidhammapi�aka, but it has been expunged from the Sarvāstivāda Abhidharmapi�aka 母者 and the Śāriputrābhidharmaśāstra, and [has been] replaced with the term ‘abhidharma’”.
73 In the case of [[EA49.1]] the sequence of enumerating the negative qualities differs from the present listing of positive qualities.

of collections of key terminology for the purpose of memorizing and deepening one’s
understanding of the Dharma. [74] The nucleus of such summaries could have been the
mental qualities and practices that were later on known under the heading of the “thirtyseven requisites to awakening” (bodhipakkhiyā dhammā), to which other categories
were added over the course of time. [75] According to the Pāli commentaries, however,
the expression mātikā stands for two mātikās, namely the code of rules for monks and
nuns, the two pātimokkhas. [76] In a way, the pātimokkha is a “summary” of proper monastic conduct, just as the requisites to awakening are a “summary” of the path of meditative practice, hence these two senses of mātikā seem not to be too different from each
other.
Be that as it may, the Pāli and Chinese versions also highlight the importance of the
following qualities:

 - feeling inspired when the Buddha teaches the Dharma, [77]


74 On the relation of the mātikās to the Abhidharma cf., e.g., Anacker 1975: 59-60, Bronkhorst 1985, Buswell 1996: 84-89, Cox 1995: 8, Frauwallner 1971b: 116-117, Gethin 1992b: 158-162, Gómez 1987/
2005: 1270, Hofinger 1946: 230, Horner 1941: 292, Hirakawa 1993/1998: 140-142, Jaini 1977: 45, Migot
1952: 524-530, Muck 1980: 15-16, Norman 1997: 51, Przyluski 1926: 334-335, Ronkin 2005: 27-30,
Warder 1961a, Watanabe 1983/1996: 42-45, and Yìnshùn 1971/1983: 252.
75 This seems to be suggested by [[MN103]] at MN II 238,26, which lists the thirty-seven bodhipakkhiyā
dharmas and then at MN II 239,4 continues to speak, in apparent reference to this list, of ‘abhidharma’.
Cf. also the definition of mātika found in the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya in T 1451 at T XXIV 408b6,
which begins with the set of thirty-seven dharmas and then lists such items as, e.g., the four types of
fearlessness, the four fruits of recluse-ship, the three samādhis, tranquillity and insight, etc.; cf. also Cox
2004a: 2, who explains that “the need to memorize the teaching obviously promoted the use of categorizing lists as a mnemonic device”.
76 This is the gloss given at Mp II 189,23 on the expression mātikādharā in [[AN5.25]] at AN I 117,29 as dvemātikādharā, the implication of which become clear in Mp III 382,11 (which comments on another occurrence of the same expression in [[AN6.51]] at AN III 361,24): mātikādharā ti dvepātimokkhadharā; cf.
also B [e] -Sp-� III 39: dve mātikā ti bhikkhumātikā bhikkhunīmātikā ca and B [e] -Kkh-p� 126: ubhayāni pātimokkhāni, dve mātikā ti attho. According to von Hinüber 1994c: 115-117, the term mātikā may have
originally referred to the pātimokkha and the Vinaya methodology implicit in this term, in the sense of
listings of terms or sentences, and would then have been applied to the nascent Abhidharma literature
(ibid. pp. 120-121); cf. also Hu-von Hinüber 1994: 230-231. On the Vinaya māt�kās (using the term in a
more general sense) cf. also Sung 1999, on their importance for understanding the structural development of the different Vinayas cf. Clarke 2004.
77 A minor difference in terminology is that while [[MN33]] at MN I 221,29 speaks of the dhamma-vinaya,
the Chinese parallels mention only the Dharma, cf. [[SA1249]] at T II 343a8, which speaks of the “Dharma
known to the Tathāgata”, ; [[EA49.1]] at T II 794c26, which refers to the “Dharma treasure
proclaimed by the Tathāgata”, ; T 123 at T II 547a11, which mentions the “proclamation
of the Dharma treasure”, ; and T 1509 at T XXV 74a26, which has the “proclamation of the Buddha-Dharma”, . In other Pāli discourses, the compound dhamma-vinaya often stands for a system
of teaching in its entirety and is used as such in relation to other teachers, such as the dhammavinaya of
Ā�āra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta in [[MN26]] at MN I 163,35 and MN I 165,18, or the dhammavinaya
of each of the six heretical teachers in [[MN77]] at MN II 3,24; cf. also Geiger 1920: 56. Carter 1978: 69
suggests that “in the early period ... this compound was probably a tappurisa in locative relation, meaning ‘training in dhamma’ and ... later, as the training became more thoroughly formulated, the compound

 - understanding the noble eightfold path,

 - being skilled in the four satipa��hānas,

 - being moderate when accepting requisites.
The quality mentioned last in all versions is to accord proper respect to elder monks
of long standing. While the Chinese versions only mention the need for respectful behaviour in regard to these elders, [78] the Pāli versions highlight the importance of developing loving kindness by way of body, speech, and mind towards them. [79]
This emphasis on the need to develop mettā in the Pāli versions and the absence of
such a treatment in the Chinese versions is noteworthy. [80] At an earlier point the two
Pāli versions, in agreement with their Chinese parallels, also reckoned teaching the
Dharma to others as an important aspect of a monk’s progress. [81]
Such concern for others is not an exceptional case, since a passage in the A�guttaranikāya shows a similar attitude. This passage contrasts those who are only concerned
with their own welfare with those who are concerned with their own welfare and the
welfare of others. According to this discourse, those who are only concerned with their
own welfare are “blameworthy” on that account, whereas those who are concerned
with their own and others’ welfare are “praiseworthy” by comparison. [82]
In line with this stipulation on being intent on one’s own and others’ welfare, the
Mahāgopālaka-sutta and its A�guttara-nikāya parallel make it clear that concern for
others, represented by the quality of loving kindness towards elders and by the willingness to teach the Dharma, should not be neglected. At the same time, by presenting

79 [[MN33]] at MN I 222,9 and [[AN11.18]] at AN V 350,13.
80 [[MN33]] and [[AN11.18]] are thus instances where Pāli discourses lay more stress on the practice of the
brahmavihāras than their Chinese parallels, in contrast to the opposite tendency noticed in relation to
[[MN25]] cf. above p. 169.
81 According to [[MN33]] at MN I 222,17, a monk who does not develop these eleven qualities, one of which
is to teach others, will be “unable to come to growth, increase, and fulfilment in this Dharma and discipline”, abhabbo imasmi� dhammavinaye vuddhi� virū�hi� vepulla� āpajjitu� (S [e] -MN I 413,17: vu��hi�), cf. also [[AN11.8]] at AN V 350,22. [[SA1249]] at T II 342c19 indicates that such a monk will “not be
able to pacify himself, nor [be able] to pacify others”, ; according to [[EA49.1]] at T
II 794b24 he will be “unable to get much benefit in this Dharma”, ; and according to T 123 at T II 546a27 such a monk will not only be unable to grow in the Dharma, but will even
“fall into the three evil paths after death”, . T 1509 examines only the positive case of a
monk who is endowed with all eleven qualities and therefore does not describe the result of being without them.
82 [[AN7.64]] at AN IV 116,22+23, using the terms gārayha and pāsa�sa. It is noteworthy that the Chinese
parallels to this discourse treat the case of one who acts only for his or her own benefit with much softer
criticism, as [[MA1]] at T I 422a6 and T 27 at T I 810b22 merely indicate that those who also benefit others
are superior and more excellent than those who are only concerned with their own benefit (a third parallel, [[EA39.1]] at T II 728b-729b, does not cover this case at all). A study of the different versions of this 不能自安, 亦不安他
discourse can be found in Schmithausen 2004. 不能於此法中多所饒益

these qualities within a context of other qualities aimed at one’s own meditative development, such concern for others is put within proper perspective, suggesting that it
should not be allowed to overshadow the other qualities, but should be subordinated to
the principal task of progress towards liberation.


[[MN34]] Cū�agopālaka-sutta

The Cū�agopālaka-sutta, the “lesser discourse on the cowherd”, compares cattle that
cross the river Ganges to Buddhist disciples who go beyond the range of Māra. This
discourse has two parallels, found in the Sa�yukta-āgama and in the Ekottarika-āgama. [83] A few parts of this discourse have also been preserved in Sanskrit fragments. [84]
The Cū�agopālaka-sutta and its parallels begin by depicting a foolish cowherd who
drives his cattle across the river Ganges in a wrong way, causing all of them to meet
with disaster. [85] The three versions agree that the cowherd had not properly examined
both shores to find a good fording place, to which the Ekottarika-āgama version adds
that he first drove the weaker cattle across. [86]
The three versions contrast this foolish cowherd with a wise cowherd, who takes the
cattle safely across the river Ganges by first driving the strong cattle across, after having carefully examined both shores and having found a good fording place.
A minor difference between the three versions is a matter of sequence, as the Majjhima-nikāya and Ekottarika-āgama versions follow the simile of the foolish cowherd by
explaining to whom this cowherd corresponds, before turning to describe the wise cowherd. The Sa�yukta-āgama discourse instead continues from the foolish cowherd directly with the wise cowherd, and only after that explains their significance (see table
4.6).
When explaining this simile, the Majjhima-nikāya version identifies the foolish cowherd with recluses and Brahmins who are unskilled in this world and what lies beyond


83 The parallels are [[SA1248]] at T II 342a-c and [[EA43.6]] at T II 761b-762a. Akanuma 1929/1990: 111
gives “cowherd”,, as a tentative title for [[SA1248]] The summary verse at T II 764c12 similarly
refers to [[EA43.6]] with . While [[MN34]] takes place on the banks of the Ganges in the Vajjian country, [[EA43.6]] takes place on the banks of the same river, but in the district of Magadha, and [[SA1248]] has
the Squirrels’ Feeding Ground at Rājagaha as its location.
84 SHT VI 1381 folio 174R2-5 and folio 175 (p. 107). SHT VI 1381 folio 174R2 locates the discourse at
Rājag�ha.
85 [[MN34]] at MN I 225,5, [[SA1248]] at T II 342a23, and [[EA43.6]] at T II 761b16. Parts of this narration have
also been preserved in SHT VI 1381 folio 174R3-5 and folio 175V1-R2. While [[MN34]] [[SA1248]] and
SHT 1381 folio 175V3 present this narration as an account of what happened in the past, [[EA43.6]] introduces the same narration as a parable.
86 [[EA43.6]] at T II 761b 牧牛者 18: . This additional detail helps to clarify the situation, since the problem
with driving cattle across a river would be that they tend to follow whichever of them is in the leading 牧牛
position, hence if the first one is carried off and misses the ford, the remainder of the group will be led
astray as well, cf. also, e.g., [[AN7.55]] at AN II 75,33 or T 203.95 at T IV 485c7, translated in Willemen
1994: 191.

it. According to the Sa�yukta-āgama version, the foolish cowherd stands for the six
heretical teachers (Pūra�a Kassapa, etc.). [87] The Ekottarika-āgama version offers still
another perspective, as here the foolish cowherd represents foolish monks who think
they can go beyond birth and death without practising the precepts, as a result of which
they perform bad deeds and lead others astray. [88] At a later point of its exposition, the
same Ekottarika-āgama discourse identifies the foolish cowherd with heterodox Brahmins instead. [89]

The differences between the three versions in regard to the implications of the foolish
cowherd give each of the three discourses a distinct flavour:

      - the image of the cowherd in the Majjhima-nikāya version serves to confirm that
confidence in the Buddha and his teaching are well directed,

      - in the Sa�yukta-āgama version this image throws into relief the contrast between
the Buddha’s teaching and the teachings of other contemporary teachers,

      - in the Ekottarika-āgama version the simile of the cowherd highlights the importance of maintaining a firm foundation in morality.

MN I 226   The three versions agree, however, that the wise cowherd represents the Tathāgata, [90]
and the different types of cattle led by the wise cowherd across the Ganges stand for an
arahant, a non-returner, a once-returner, and a stream-enterer. [91] The Majjhima-nikāya


87 [[SA1248]] at T II 342b7: . The Pāli commentary similarly explains that the reference to unskilled recluses and Brahmins intends the six contemporary teachers, Ps II 266,28: cha satthāro dassitā

89 [[EA43.6]] at T II 762a1: .
90 [[MN34]] at MN I 226,4 first identifies the wise cowherd with recluses and Brahmins skilled in this world
and what goes beyond it, and then at MN I 226,37 indicates that the Buddha is skilled in this world and
what goes beyond it.

version also includes monks who are Dharma-followers or faith-followers in this listing. [92] Although Dharma-followers or faith-followers are not mentioned in either of the
Chinese versions, the Ekottarika-āgama version refers to those who have faith and regard for the Dharma. [93]
The three versions conclude by summing up the gist of the discourse in three stanzas,
which highlight the Buddha’s ability to lead his disciples beyond Māra’s realm. [94]


[[MN35]] Cū�asaccaka-sutta

The Cū�asaccaka-sutta, the “lesser discourse to Saccaka”, reports how the Buddha
expounded the absence of a self in reply to a challenge by the debater Saccaka. This
discourse has two Chinese parallels, found in the Sa�yukta-āgama and in the Ekottarika-āgama. [95] In addition to these two parallels, a few words of the present discourse
have been preserved in Sanskrit fragments. [96]

92 [[MN34]] at MN I 226,35: bhikkhū dhammānusārino saddhānusārino.
93 [[EA43.6]] at T II 761c19: . In its concluding stanzas, [[EA43.6]] at T II 761c25 speaks of five types
of person,, which corroborates that the reference to corresponds to a single type of person, in addition to the four types who have reached the four stages of awakening. [[EA43.6]] at T II 761c4+
28 also identifies the path by which the Tathāgata leads disciples beyond Māra’s realm with the noble
eightfold path, an explanation which appears to be the reason why this discourse was included among
the eights of the Ekottarika-āgama. After the stanzas, [[EA43.6]] at T II 761c27 continues with an injunction to the monks that they should develop this path.
94 [[MN34]] at MN I 227,8, [[SA1248]] at T II 342c4, and [[EA43.6]] at T II 761c21.
95 The parallels are [[SA110]] at T II 35a-37b and [[EA37.10]] at T II 715a-717b. [[SA110]] has the title “Saccaka”,, a title found in the uddāna at T II 37b27. [[MN35]] [[SA110]] and [[EA37.10]] agree on locating the
discourse at Vesālī. [[SA110]] has been translated in Anālayo 2010k, excerpts from [[SA110]] and [[EA37.10]] 信奉法
have been translated in Kuan 2009: 157-161. While [[MN35]] further specifies that the Buddha was in the 五種人 信奉法
Kū�āgārasālā in the Great Wood (mahāvana), [[SA110]] at T II 35a17 reports that he was on the bank of
the Monkey Pond, . A Monkey Pond occurs also in a Sanskrit fragment parallel to [[MN12]] and
in Sanskrit fragments of the Mahāparinirvā�a-sūtra, according to which the Kū�āgāraśālā was situated
on the bank of this pond, cf. SHT IV 32 folio 41R5 (p. 137): (ma)r[ka]�ahradatīre kū�ā-[g](āraśālā)[y]
(ā)� and [[SN360]] folio 173V5-6 in Waldschmidt 1950: 19: markka�a[hrad](atīre kū)�agāraśālāyām. [[EA37.10]] at T II 715a28 speaks of the Buddha’s location simply as a wood outside of Vesālī. References to
the Monkey Pond recur frequently in the Dīrgha-āgama, in the Sa�yukta-āgama and in the Ekottarikaāgama 薩遮 . [[DA15]] at T I 66a23 and [[EA40.5]] at T II 739b10 similarly locate this pond near Vesālī, to which
[[DA15]] adds that this pond had a Dharma hall,, at its side. Numerous occurrences in the Sa�yuktaāgama identify this hall on the bank of the Monkey Pond as the Kū�āgārasālā,, cf. [[SA81]] at T
II 20b28, [[SA83]] at T II 21b14, [[SA237]] at T II 57b28, [[SA238]] at T II 57c14, [[SA239]] at T II 57c24, [[SA240]]

The same Monkey Pond recurs also in the Avadānaśataka, Speyer 1906/1970: 8,5
or Vaidya 1958a: 4,19, in the Bhai�ajyavastu of the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, Dutt 1984a: 224,14, in

MN I 227


224   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


MN I 227   The Cū�asaccaka-sutta and its parallel in the Sa�yukta-āgama begin by narrating
that Saccaka, who was known as a skilled debater, thought that nobody could engage
him in debate without trembling and sweating. [97] Such an indication is not made in the
Ekottarika-āgama discourse. The three versions agree that Saccaka met the monk Assaji and inquired how the Buddha instructed his disciples.

MN I 228   According to all versions, the answer given by Assaji did not please Saccaka. The
parallel versions differ, however, on the content of the answer given by Assaji:

      - In the Majjhima-nikāya version, Assaji’s answer is that the Buddha instructed his
disciples to contemplate the five aggregates as impermanent and not-self. [98]

      - In the Sa�yukta-āgama version, he answers that the Buddha taught his disciples
that the five aggregates are devoid of self and should be contemplated as a disease, a boil, a thorn, murderous, impermanent, dukkha, empty, and not-self. [99]

      - In the Ekottarika-āgama version, Assaji replies that the Buddha taught that the
five aggregates are impermanent, what is impermanent is dukkha, what is dukkha
is not-self, what is not-self is empty and thus is neither mine nor ‘I’. [100]
When evaluating these different presentations, it is conspicuous that, unlike the two
Chinese versions, the Pāli version lacks the characteristic of dukkha. This is unusual,
since the early discourses found in the Nikāyas and Āgamas regularly include dukkha
in such contexts. The commentary to the Cū�asaccaka-sutta explains that Assaji did
not mention the characteristic of dukkha in order to avoid being contradicted by Saccaka, since Saccaka might have assumed this to imply that path and fruit are also dukkha and therefore be led to despise the Buddha’s teaching. [101]
An instance where the characteristic of dukkha is likewise absent occurs in a discourse in the Sa�yutta-nikāya and in its parallel in the Sa�yukta-āgama. The two versions agree in presenting a contemplation of the five aggregates only in terms of impermanence and not-self. [102] The Pāli commentary to this Sa�yutta-nikāya discourse gives
an explanation similar to the one offered in the commentary to the Cū�asaccaka-sut
location, cf. T 2087 at T LI 908b17, translated in Beal 1884/2001b: 68. Skilling 1997a: 295 remarks
that “the Marka�ahrada is well known in (Mūla)Sarvāstivādin texts, but unknown in Pāli”, cf. also ibid.

97 While according to [[MN35]] at MN I 227,19 Saccaka made this claim publicly, [[SA110]] at T II 35a20 records the same claim as a mental presumption held by him.

ta. [103] The decisive difference in this instance, however, is that this instruction was given
to the monk Channa, who had difficulties finding inspiration in the goal of Nirvā�a.
Thus in this case the commentarial explanation makes sense, since Channa’s lack of
inspiration would indeed have been aggravated if he had come to consider path and
fruit in a negative light.
In relation to Saccaka, however, the commentarial explanation seems less convincing,
since one would not expect Assaji to be worried about the possibility that Saccaka
might consider path and fruit in a negative light. In fact, the reply given by Assaji does
not seem to be formulated in such a way as to avoid contradiction, as all versions report that Saccaka expressed his displeasure and disagreement immediately. According
to the Ekottarika-āgama account, Saccaka even went so far as to cover his ears and tell
Assaji to stop speaking. [104] Thus the commentarial explanation could be just a mechanical repetition of the commentarial gloss given in regard to the Sa�yutta-nikāya discourse.
If Assaji had wanted to avoid contradiction, one would also expect him to omit rather
the characteristic of not-self, since a teaching on the absence of a self would have been
a more provocative proposition. In contrast, a teaching on dukkha would be a less extraordinary proposal, as other contemporary recluses were also delivering teachings on
how to make an end of dukkha. [105] Thus, if Assaji had indeed wanted to avoid contradiction, it would have been more sensible for him to avoid referring to not-self instead
of omitting dukkha. According to the ensuing discussion between Saccaka and the
Buddha, the characteristic of not-self was in fact what really provoked Saccaka, while
the other two characteristics appear to play only a subsidiary role in their discussion.
Another point that does not fit too well with the commentarial explanation is that Assaji explicitly presents his succinct statement as the way the Buddha usually instructs
his disciples. [106] It would to some extent become a case of attributing conscious misrepresentation to Assaji, if he were to be shown as giving only a partial account of the Buddha’s instruction and then pretend this to correspond to the way the Buddha usually instructs his disciples.
Moreover, in the Cū�asaccaka-sutta the Buddha repeats the statement made by Assaji,
so that in the Pāli account the Buddha himself explicitly endorses that his standard
teaching is concerned only with impermanence and not-self, not with dukkha. [107]
In sum, it seems as if the omission of the dukkha characteristic in the Pāli version of
Assaji’s statement, although certainly constituting the more unusual reading, does not
fit the context too well. The absence of dukkha in the present passage is all the more remarkable as the Pāli discourses generally place a consistent emphasis on this charac

teristic, whereas the same does not appear to be always the case for works that belong
to the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda tradition. The (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, for example,
speaks repeatedly of three Dharma ‘seals’, which are: “all formations are impermanent,
all dharmas are not-self, Nirvā�a is quiescence”, thereby not mentioning the characteristic of dukkha. [108] The absence of dukkha in a similar context recurs also in another discourse in the Sa�yukta-āgama. [109] Hence it would have been less surprising if the Cū�asaccaka-sutta had included dukkha in its presentation and the Sa�yukta-āgama had not
mentioned it.
Thus, even though it seems improbable that a reference to dukkha could have been
lost during the transmission of the Pāli version, it seems also improbable that a reference to dukkha was added in the Sa�yukta-āgama version, as within the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda tradition in general a tendency to omit dukkha can be discerned.
Whatever may be the final word on this particular passage, the Cū�asaccaka-sutta
and its parallels continue with Saccaka publicly boasting how he was going to defeat
the Buddha in debate. The three versions differ in regard to the similes used by Saccaka to illustrate his impending victory (see table 4.7).
Out of a set of four similes found in the Majjhima-nikāya version, [110] a simile that describes catching a long haired sheep recurs in the Ekottarika-āgama version, [111] while a
simile of a brewer who holds a sieve can be found in the Sa�yukta-āgama version (although in its presentation the point made with this simile is to use it to press wine, not
to drag it here and there). [112]
The Pāli version’s imagery of an elephant that plunges into deep water recurs in both
Chinese versions. [113] While in the Majjhima-nikāya version this elephant plays a game of
hemp washing, the Sa�yukta-āgama version describes how the elephant trainer washes


108 The are, and, references to which, in varying formulations,
can be found in the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya in T 1442 at T XXIII 670c1, T 1442 at T XXIII 836b12,
T 1442 at T XXIII 863c29, T 1448 at T XXIV 50b18, and T 1450 at T XXIV 198a24. Another instance
can be found in the Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1978a: 254,24, which reports that the nun Utpalavar�ā,
after she had been hit by Devadatta (cf. also below p. 286 note 112) and was about to pass away, reflected: sarvasa�skārā anityā�, sarvadharmā anātmāna�, śānta� nirvā�am; cf. also the survey in Lamotte 1970a: 1369.
109 [[SA262]] at T II 66b14+16 and T II 66c7+9+22. Other discourses in the Sa�yukta-āgama, however, do include dukkha in such contexts. The same holds true for Ekottarika-āgama discourses, which regularly
speak of four Dharma seals, thereby including dukkha in their presentations, cf., e.g., [[EA26.8]] at T II
639a 三法印 5, [[EA31.4]] at T II 668c 一切行無常, 3, and [[EA42.3]] at T II 749a 一切法無我 涅槃寂滅 9; a presentation that recurs also in the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, T 1428 at T XXII 949b8.
110 [[MN35]] at MN I 228,29. This set of images recurs in a similar context in [[MN56]] at MN I 374,26, where
a lay follower of the Jains uses them to describe how he is going to defeat the Buddha.
111 [[EA37.10]] at T II 715b21. At this point, according to [[EA37.10]] at T II 715b29 Saccaka also claimed to
be able to make even an insentient post shake, similar to the claim he made in the introductory narration of the Pāli version, [[MN35]] at MN I 227,24, an introductory account otherwise not found in [[EA37.10]]
112 [[SA110]] at T II 35b16.

this elephant. After delivering these similes, Saccaka went to the presence of the Buddha, followed by a group of householders wondering who of the two will refute the
other.

The Majjhima-nikāya and the Sa�yukta-āgama versions report in similar ways that
Saccaka proclaimed the five aggregates to be a person’s self, comparing this selfhood
to the way the earth supports the growth of plants. In the Ekottarika-āgama presentation, however, the point at stake was rather impermanence, since here Saccaka proposed that form is permanent. [114]
According to all versions, in reply the Buddha brought up the example of a king who
exercises power in his domain. The Majjhima-nikāya and the Sa�yukta-āgama versions use this example to explain that, whereas such a king can exercise power in his
domain, human beings cannot exercise such power over the five aggregates, ordering
them to be according to their likes and wishes. [115] The Ekottarika-āgama version instead points out that even though a king is able to exercise power in his domain, he will
eventually become old, with white hair and a wrinkled face. [116]

115 [[MN35]] at MN I 231,17 and [[SA110]] at T II 36a11. Wynne 2009: 106 comments that the “example of a
king’s ability to exert control in his own kingdom ... no doubt ... was designed to appeal to the Licchavis witnessing the debate”.
116 [[EA37.10]] at T II 716a4 also differs from the other versions by presenting this king as a wheel-turning
king, . After the intervention of a thunderbolt-wielding yakkha (mentioned in all versions),
[[EA37.10]] continues by reporting that Saccaka again affirmed the body to be permanent, in spite of the
Buddha’s example of how even a wheel-turning king grows old. The Buddha then questioned Saccaka
why the wheel-turning king could not order old age, disease, and death to disappear, whereon Saccaka
was unable to reply. This whole presentation does not seem to fit the context particularly well, since
one would not expect a clever debater like Saccaka to be so easily refuted by a simple illustration of 色者是常
impermanence.

The three versions record that when Saccaka remained silent instead of replying to
the question posed by the Buddha, a thunderbolt wielding yakkha intervened, threatening to split Saccaka’s head into seven pieces should he not reply. [117] The Majjhima-nikāya and the Sa�yukta-āgama versions report in similar terms that, once Saccaka finally replied, the Buddha engaged him in a question and answer catechism on the impermanent, unsatisfactory, and not-self nature of the five aggregates. The Majjhima-nikāya version concludes this catechism by pointing out that someone, who regards as
self what in reality is dukkha, will not be able to transcend dukkha. [118] The Sa�yuktaāgama version explains that attachment to the five aggregates will cause dejection and
sorrow when these aggregates undergo change, whereas through detachment from the
five aggregates one will be unaffected by their change. [119]

MN I 233   The Majjhima-nikāya and Sa�yukta-āgama versions employ the simile of a man in
search of heartwood, who cuts down a large plantain tree and discovers no essence in it,
to illustrate the vanity of Saccaka’s earlier claim that nobody could engage him in debate without trembling and sweating. Both versions report that the Buddha uncovered
his body to show that he had remained unaffected by their discussion. [120]
Although the Ekottarika-āgama does not have the simile of a man in search of heartwood, it does, however, report that the Buddha uncovered his body, reminding Saccaka
of his earlier boast.
A difference between the three versions is that according to the Majjhima-nikāya and
Ekottarika-āgama account, the Buddha uncovered his body in order to demonstrate
that he was not sweating, [121] while according to the Sa�yukta-āgama version he uncovered his body in order to demonstrate that not even a single hair on his body had been
stirred. [122] The Pāli version’s description of this act by the Buddha speaks of him un

117 While in [[MN35]] at MN I 231,30 the yakkha Vajirapā�i appears before a third repetition of the question,
in [[SA110]] at T II 36a15 and [[EA37.10]] at T II 716a7 he appears only once the third repetition of the
question meets with no reply. The same Vajirapā�i intervenes in a similar situation in [[DN3]] at DN I
95,8. The commentaries to [[DN3]] and [[MN35]] Sv I 264,13 and Ps II 277,35, identify him with Sakka; cf.
also Godage 1945: 51-52. In Gandhāran art, however, Vajirapā�i and Indra are distinct from each other,
cf. Coomaraswamy 1971: 31, Foucher 1905: 564, Konow 1930: 317, Santoro 1979: 301, id. 1991: 295,
Senart 1906: 122, and Vogel 1909: 525, as is the case for Amarāvatī iconography, cf. Sivaramamurti
1942/1956: 89 (on the significance of the vajra in relation to Indra in general cf., e.g., Chakravarti 1997/
2006: 96-99). As noted by Lamotte 1966: 115, cf. also Flood 1989: 23, a characteristic feature of such
interventions by Vajirapā�i is that he will only be visible to the Buddha and his adversaries, but not to
other spectators witnessing the scene. On the threat that an opponent’s head will split to pieces in ancient Indian literature cf., e.g., de La Vallée Poussin 1932, Hopkins 1932: 316, Insler 1989/1990, and
Witzel 1987; on debating practices in the Pāli discourses cf. also Manné 1992; on ancient Indian debate

covering his “golden coloured” body, a qualification not used in the two Chinese versions. [123]
The three versions agree that a spectator intervened at this point and compared Saccaka to a crab with all its legs cut off, unable to return to its pond. [124] The Majjhima-nikāya and the Sa�yukta-āgama versions continue by reporting that Saccaka questioned
the Buddha how a disciple progresses beyond doubt, [125] an inquiry not found in the
Ekottarika-āgama discourse. In reply, the Buddha described how to contemplate the
five aggregates as devoid of a self.
When Saccaka asked what makes a disciple an arahant, the Buddha replied that an
arahant has reached unsurpassable liberation and knows the five aggregates to be devoid of a self. Such a monk is endowed with unsurpassable vision (or unsurpassable
knowledge according to the Sa�yukta-āgama version), unsurpassable path and unsurpassable deliverance. [126] Having reched the final goal, such a monk is one who respects


123 [[MN35]] at MN I 233,36: suva��ava��a� kāya�. Ps II 280,5 takes this qualification in a literal sense and
describes how on opening his robes for just four fingers’ width, rays of golden light emanated from the
Buddha’s body. The golden hue of the Buddha’s skin constitutes one of the thirty-two marks of a superior being, cf. also [[DN14]] at DN II 17,30, [[DN30]] at DN III 143,24, [[MN91]] at MN II 136,18, and below
p. 532.
124 [[SA110]] at T II 36c1 reports that this spectator came out with additional similes to illustrate Saccaka’s
utter defeat. [[EA37.10]] at T II 716b10 has only the simile of the crab found in [[MN35]] at MN I 234,7,
after which [[EA37.10]] continues with the question and answer catechism on the impermanent and notself nature of the five aggregates found already at an earlier point in the other two versions. The simile
of the crab recurs in [[SN35.32]] at SN I 123,19 (or SN [2] 160 at SN [2] I 271,8) to illustrate Māra’s defeat.
125 [[MN35]] at MN I 234,31: ti��avicikiccho vigatakatha�katho vesārajjappatto aparappaccayo satthusāsane, a standard reference to stream-entry in the discourses. It is noteworthy that [[MN35]] depicts Saccaka
using such typically Buddhist expressions even though he is supposedly an outsider unfamiliar with the
Buddhist teachings and according to [[MN35]] at MN I 228,6 does not even know that the Buddha taught
impermanence and not-self. In [[MN35]] at MN I 235,10 Saccaka then again uses such standard phrases
when he describes an arahant to be khī�āsavo vusitavā katakara�īyo ohitabhāro anuppattasadattho parikkhī�abhavasa�yojano sammadaññā vimutto (C [e] -MN I 556,14 and S [e] -MN I 434,7: parikkhī�abhavasaññojano), in which case [[SA110]] at T II 36c23 reports a similarly detailed inquiry, reading:
. Evidently standard pericopes were applied to the present discourse in the course of oral tradition, even though these
would not fit a speaker like Saccaka.
126 [[MN35]] at MN I 235,28 lists dassanānuttariya, pa�ipadānuttariya, vimuttānuttariya. [[SA110]] at T II 37a1
actually reads “unsurpassable knowledge, unsurpassable liberation, and unsurpassable knowledge and
vision of liberation”,, but has “unsurpassable path”,, as a
, and variant reading for the second quality, and “unsurpassable liberation” (i.e. without “knowledge and vision”) as a, and variant reading for the third quality, so that on adopting the variant readings the two versions would be fairly close to each other in regard to the second and third qualities. The three unsurpassable qualities found in [[MN35]] recur in the Sa�gīti-sutta in [[DN33]] at DN III 得盡諸漏,
無漏, 219,16 心解脫,, where a Sanskrit fragment parallel from the 慧解脫, 現法自知作證, 我生已盡, 梵行已立, Sa�gīti-sūtra 所作已作, has preserved 自知不受後有 (jñānā)[nutta]rya�
prati(padānuttarya�), cf. K 484 (37)V8 in Stache-Rosen 1968: 23. The Sa�gītiparyāya reads “unsurpassable practice, unsurpassable knowledge, and unsurpassable liberation”, T 1536 at T XXVI 390c29:
, thereby being similar to the presentation in [[SA110]] (if the variant readings
are adopted).

and venerates the Buddha as one who has reached awakening and who teaches it to
others. [127]

MN I 236   All versions report that Saccaka admitted his foolishness in attempting to challenge
the Buddha. According to the Majjhima-nikāya version, he illustrated the futility of his
attempt by proclaiming that it would be easier to get away with attacking a mad elephant, a fire, or a poisonous snake than getting away with challenging the Buddha (see
table 4.8). [128]
In addition to these three similes, the Sa�yukta-āgama discourse employs the images
of safely getting away from the edge of the sword of a strong man and from a hungry
lion. The Ekottarika-āgama version only describes the fearlessness of a lion, followed
by reporting that Saccaka took refuge as a lay disciple. [129]

The Pāli and Chinese accounts agree that Saccaka invited the Buddha and the monks
for a meal. According to the Pāli version, once the meal was finished Saccaka made an
aspiration, dedicating the merit of this food offering to the Licchavis who had supplied
him with the food to be given to the Buddha and the community of monks. In reply to
this dedication of merit, the Buddha clarified that the Licchavis will receive the merit
to be gained by giving to one like Saccaka, who is not free from lust, anger, and delusion. In contrast, Saccaka himself will reap the merit gained by giving food to the Buddha, who is free from lust, anger, and delusion. [131]

The Sa�yukta-āgama records a similar statement, although in a different context.
According to its presentation, at the completion of the meal the Buddha spoke a set of
stanzas and also delivered a discourse to Saccaka. Once the Buddha and the monks had
left Saccaka and were on their way back to the monastery, the monks deliberated
among themselves about the merit obtained by Saccaka and the Licchavis respectively.
Back at the monastery, the monks posed this question to the Buddha, who replied by
explaining that the Licchavis will earn the merit to be obtained by giving to one who is
not free from lust, anger, and delusion, whereas Saccaka will receive the merit of giving to one who is free from these three root defilements. [132]
Since according to the Majjhima-nikāya account Saccaka was considered by many of
his contemporaries to be a saint, [133] the Buddha’s declaration made in the Pāli version
would have appeared to Saccaka as insulting and offensive. Therefore it is rather unexpected when the Buddha makes such a statement after Saccaka had publicly admitted
the foolishness of his earlier attempt to challenge the Buddha, had just provided the
Buddha and the monks with a meal, and was formulating an aspiration to share the
merit acquired by this food offering. The Sa�yukta-āgama, in contrast, does not present the Buddha in the almost resentful attitude attributed to him in the Majjhima-nikāya version, as according to its presentation the Buddha made this statement to the
monks when Saccaka was no longer present.
The Ekottarika-āgama discourse differs considerably from the other two versions, as
it reports that the Buddha delivered a gradual discourse at the completion of the meal,
which caused Saccaka’s attainment of stream-entry. [134] The Ekottarika-āgama version
continues by relating that on a later occasion Saccaka’s disciples, who had found out
that their teacher had been converted by the Buddha, intercepted him when he was
coming back from another visit to the Buddha and killed him. [135]
This tale is surprising, since none of the discourses mention that Saccaka had disciples, [136] which would have been present during such an important encounter of their
teacher with the Buddha, all the more since according to all versions Saccaka had made
a public announcement of his intention to challenge the Buddha and had invited a substantial number of people to join him and witness the discussion.
Even if Saccaka did have disciples, which due to some circumstances could not be
present during his meeting with the Buddha, it would be rather extreme for them to kill

ratne 1965: 748, and Woodward 1914: 46-47 and 50. On the ancient Indian conception of merit cf.,
e.g., Filliozat 1980, Hara 1994, and Wezler 1997.
132 [[SA110]] at T II 37b22. An extract from the present discussion already appeared in Anālayo 2005b: 10.
133 [[MN35]] at MN I 227,18: sādhusammato bahujanassa.
134 [[EA37.10]] at T II 717a5.
135 [[EA37.10]] at T II 717a25 continues by reporting that the Buddha, on being informed of the murder and
asked about the victim’s level of rebirth, declared that Saccaka had been reborn as a stream-enterer in
the heaven of the Thirty-three and will make an end of dukkha in the presence of Buddha Maitreya.
136 An otherwise different story involving Saccaka in a Dharmapada Avadāna collection preserved in
Chinese, however, does mention that he had a following of five hundred disciples, cf. T 211 at T IV
597a5, translated in Willemen 1999: 151.


232   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


their teacher, just because he had become a follower of the Buddha. In ancient India, a
group of disciples would probably rather follow their teacher’s example, as the disciples of Uruvela Kassapa did according to the Pāli Vinaya and the Catu�pari�at-sūtra
when their teacher decided to become a disciple of the Buddha. [137] Alternatively, Saccaka’s disciples might have left him and continued on their own, as did the five monks
when the Buddha had given up his ascetic practices. To go so far as to kill their teacher
seems an improbable act in view of the ancient Indian respect for a teacher.
The Ekottarika-āgama report of Saccaka’s death also stands in opposition to the Mahāsaccaka-sutta, according to which Saccaka visited the Buddha on what appears to be
a subsequent occasion. [138] Although this other visit could be taken to be a visit that took
place between the present discourse and his murder, according to the Mahāsaccakasutta his attitude during this visit was somewhat provocative and his intention was to
challenge the Buddha again. [139] Such an attitude would not be compatible with his attainment of stream-entry, which according to the Ekottarika-āgama version he achieved
right after the meal following what according to all versions of the present discourse
was his first encounter with the Buddha.
The Ekottarika-āgama account of the present events thus seems to offer the least
probable account of what took place after the meal offered by Saccaka. In contrast, the
most natural version seems to be found in the Sa�yukta-āgama presentation, according
to which the Buddha gave a discourse, as he usually would do after a meal offering,
and only when being back at the monastery made a statement on the merit incurred by
Saccaka.


[[MN36]] Mahāsaccaka-sutta

The Mahāsaccaka-sutta, the “greater discourse to Saccaka”, reports another discussion between the Buddha and the debater Saccaka. This discourse has a parallel preserved in Sanskrit fragments, [140] entitled “development of the body” (kāyabhāvanā). [141]


137 Vin I 33,2 and [[SN362]] (59)R8 in Waldschmidt 1952: 35 (cf. also Gnoli 1977: 228,26). Solomon 1978:
848 explains that according to debating customs in ancient India “from the times of the Buddha and
Mahāvīra this practice was in vogue of a teacher entering into an intellectual contest with another and
he who was defeated became along with his disciples a follower of the one who was victorious or could
convince the other”.
138 [[MN36]] at MN I 237,18.
139 This can be seen from the circumstance that [[MN36]] at MN I 240,7 qualifies a statement made by Saccaka during this encounter as offensive, and from its report at MN I 249,37 that Saccaka insinuated that
the afternoon nap taken by the Buddha during the hot season was a manifestation of delusion. In fact,
as noted by Jaini 1979/1998: 192, in the Jain tradition an accomplished saint was held to be beyond
sleeping; cf., e.g., the Āyāra�ga 1.3.1.1 in Schubring 1910/1966: 13,8: suttā amu�ī, mu�i�o sayaya�
jāgaranti (Jacobi 1882: 14,1 reads jāgara�ti), translated in Jacobi 1884/1996: 28: “the unwise sleep,
the sages always wake”, cf. also Bollée 2004: 94 note 103.
140 A counterpart to the whole discourse can be found in the fragments 329r4-340r2 of the newly found
Dīrgha-āgama manuscript, edited in Liu 2009: 48-63. Other relevant fragments are SHT III 931 (pp.


Chapter 4 Mahāyamaka-vagga                                  -  233


The undertaking of such “development of the body” forms the topic of the first part of
the Mahāsaccaka-sutta.
The Mahāsaccaka-sutta and its Sanskrit parallel report that on his alms round the
Buddha happened to see Saccaka, to whom the Sanskrit version refers to as Sātyaki,
and on a recommendation by Ānanda sat down to give Saccaka an opportunity for an
exchange.
Saccaka approached the Buddha and broached the theme of development of the body
in contrast to development of the mind, concluding that the Buddhist monks were practising the latter, but not the former. Asked about development of the body, Saccaka mentioned several Ājīvikas and described their practice, [142] whereas on being asked about development of the mind he was unable to give a proper explanation.
The Buddha thereon began his explanation by depicting how a wordling is overwhelmed by pleasant or painful feelings. A difference between the two versions at this
point is that the Sanskrit fragments distinguish between bodily and mental feelings,
indicating that the worldling is overwhelmed by these because he has neither developed the body nor the mind. [143]
Judging from this presentation, development of the body stands for the ability to maintain balance with feelings originating from bodily discomfort or pain, while development of the mind refers to the same ability in regard to feelings that arise due to mentally stressful or unpleasant experiences.
The Majjhima-nikāya version instead relates pleasant feelings to the development of
the body and painful feelings to the development of the mind. [144] The commentary then
glosses development of the body as representing insight and development of the mind
as standing for concentration. [145] This explanation seems less straightforward than the

presentation in the Sanskrit fragment and could be attempting to make sense of what
may be a transmission error. [146]
Judging from the Sanskrit version, the sense of the passage would be that some degree of physical hardening through asceticism or observance of restraint, enabling one
to bear bodily pain, constitutes “development of the body”. “Development of the mind”,
however, would stand for a type of mental cultivation that enables one to remain balanced with disagreeable experiences such as being insulted, defamed, or treated unjustly, etc.
According to the Majjhima-nikāya version, Saccaka at this point proclaimed that he
believed the Buddha to be developed in body as well as in mind. The Buddha’s reply to
this proclamation indicates that it must have been made in a somewhat ironic manner,
as he notes that Saccaka’s words are offensive. [147]
In the corresponding passage in the Sanskrit version, Saccaka simply inquires if the
Buddhist monks develop both body and mind. On receiving an affirmative reply, he
asks if the Buddha himself also develops both body and mind. The Buddha replies that
if of anyone it could rightly be said that he has developed body and mind, then of him
this can rightly be said.
The two versions agree that Saccaka inquired if the Buddha had never experienced
pleasant or painful feelings that overwhelmed his mind, in reply to which the Buddha
delivered an account of his pre-awakening ascetic practices. [148]
This part of the Mahāsaccaka-sutta recurs in two Pāli discourses in the Majjhima-nikāya and has two Chinese parallels, one of which occurs in the Ekottarika-āgama, while
the other is an individual translation. [149] A description of the same events can also be
found in the Lalitavistara, in the Mahāvastu of the Mahāsā�ghika-Lokottaravāda Vi

AN I 249,30, and [[AN10.24]] at AN V 42,16, where the expression bhāvitakāya is followed by bhāvitasīla, and bhāvitacitta is followed by bhāvitapaññā. These listings do not give the impression as if the
two terms were meant to refer to insight and tranquillity.
146 The expression yassa kassaci at the beginning of the passage in question in [[MN36]] at MN I 239,21
hangs a little in the air, as it does not lead on to a corresponding tassa or tam aha� vadāmi, unlike the
Sanskrit version, where yasya kasyacid is followed by tam aham ... vadāmy. This gives the impression
that a transmission error occurred at this junction of the Pāli discourse, whereby the references to the
“development of the body” and the “development of the mind” were associated with one type of feeling
only.

naya, and in the Sa�ghabhedavastu of the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya. [150] The part of
the Mahāsaccaka-sutta that records the Buddha’s awakening after he had given up his
ascetic practices has also a parallel in a passage from the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya. [151]
According to the Mahāsaccaka-sutta, the Buddha preceded an account of his ascetic
practices by delivering three similes. These similes compare an attempt to reach awakening without being bodily and mentally withdrawn from sensuality to trying to light a
fire with wood that is immersed in water or else taken out of water but still wet. [152]
In contrast, just as lighting a fire will only be possible with dry wood, similarly only
someone who is bodily and mentally withdrawn from sensuality will be able to reach
awakening, an ability that is, however, independent of whether he practises austerities
or not. [153] In the Sanskrit fragment version, these similes occur after the description of
the ascetic practices and thus lead over to the bodhisattva recollecting an earlier experience of the first jhāna (see table 4.9). [154]
While the Lalitavistara and the Mahāvastu agree with the Mahāsaccaka-sutta on
placing these three similes before the bodhisattva’s ascetic practices, [155] the Sa�ghabhedavastu first describes most of the ascetic practices and only then comes to the
three similes. [156]
As the three similes in the Mahāsaccaka-sutta imply that awakening does not necessarily require austerities, it is puzzling that the Mahāsaccaka-sutta places them before the bodhisattva’s ascetic practices. If the bodhisattva had already realized that austerities are not necessary for awakening before undertaking them, there would have

152 In the case of the second simile, while Ee-MN I 241,26 reads kāyena c’ eva kāmehi avūpaka��hā, Be-M I
308,22, C [e] -M I 574, and S [e] -M I 449,6 read vūpaka��hā, which, given the context, is the preferable reading,
as also noted by Trenckner 1888/1993: 550 (B [e] -M I 308,21 also reads kāyena c’ eva cittena ca, which
would not fit the case described in the second simile); cf. also Dutoit 1905: 32. The corresponding passage in fragment 336r5 in Liu 2009: 57 in fact reads kāyena vyapak���(ā) viharanti [na] ci[tt](e)[n](a),
cf. also Liu 2009: 110 note 1 and 3, although then fragment 336v1 in Liu 2009: 58 repeats the same formulation for the third simile, where, judging from the context, on would rather expect the reading kāyena vyapak���ā viharanti cittena ca.
153 [[MN36]] at MN I 242,14 follows the third simile with the conclusion “if they feel racking ... painful feeling ... if they do not feel racking ... painful feelings – they are capable of knowledge, vision and supreme awakening”, opakkamikā ce pi te ... dukkhā ... vedanā vediyanti ... no ce pi te ... opakkamikā
dukkhā ... vedanā vediyanti, bhabbā va te ñā�āya dassanāya anuttarāya sambodhāya (B [e] -MN I 308,26:

occurrence of these three similes can be found in T 190 at T III 764c12.
156 Gnoli 1977: 104,20. Although at this point the Sa�ghabhedavastu has described most of the ascetic
practices, it nevertheless follows the three similes with a short description of how the bodhisattva subsisted on a single fruit per day, cf. Gnoli 1977: 105,29, so that in its account, too, the similes do not
really mark the end of his ascetic practices.

been little reason for him to engage in them at all. [157] In this respect, the Sanskrit fragment version’s presentation seems to fit the context better.

The same argument does not apply to the account given in the Lalitavistara and the
Mahāvastu, since their version of the three similes only highlights the need to stay
aloof from sensuality in body and mind, without drawing the conclusion that awakening can be reached independent of the practice of austerities. [158] Hence in these versions,


157 Bodhi in Ñā�amoli 1995/2005: 1229 note 387 comments: “it is puzzling that ... the Bodhisatta is shown
engaging in self-mortification after he had here come to the conclusion that such practices are useless
for the attainment of enlightenment. This dissonant juxtaposition of ideas raises a suspicion that the narrative sequence of the sutta has become jumbled. The appropriate place for the simile ... would be at the
end of the Bodhisatta’s period of ascetic experimentation, when he has acquired a sound basis for rejecting self-mortification”. The commentary, Ps II 288,17, however, explains that even though the practice of austerities was not required for the bodhisattva to reach awakening, he nevertheless undertook
these practices to set an example of his energetic striving to others. In a similar vein, the Lalitavistara
in Lefmann 1902: 250,21 or Vaidya 1958b: 184,3 suggests that the bodhisattva undertook austerities in
order to humble other ascetics and to confound his adversaries.
158 After the third simile, the Lalitavistara and the Mahāvastu conclude that one who thus stays aloof from
sensuality will be able to reach awakening with whatever painful feelings he experiences, without considering the alternative possibility, envisaged in the Pāli version, that such a one may also reach awakening without undergoing painful feelings, cf. Lefmann 1902: 247,14 or Vaidya 1958b: 182,7: ki� cāpi
te ātmopakramikā� ... du�khā� ... vedayante, atha khalu punarbhavyā eva te uttari-manu�yadharmādalamāryajñāna-darśana-viśe�a� sāk�ātkartu�, and Basak 1965: 172,11 or Senart 1890: 123,5: ki�
cāpi te ... ātmopakramikā� ... du�khā� ... vedayanti, atha khalu bhavyā ca te uttari-manu�ya-dharmasya jñānāye darśanāye sa�bodhāye. The Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1977: 105,25 also takes up
only one possibility, in its case, however, the possibility that awakening can be gained without under

Chapter 4 Mahāyamaka-vagga                                  -  237


the import of the three similes is only that for asceticism to bear fruit, bodily and mental withdrawal from sensuality is required. The Lalitavistara and the Mahāvastu continue in fact by reporting how the bodhisattva reflected that he would be able to reach
awakening by undertaking austerities while staying aloof from sensuality in body and
mind. [159]
Thus what causes the similes in the Mahāsaccaka-sutta to be off sequence in the
overall account is the statement made after each of them, which relates the ability to
reach awakening to two alternatives: one might engage in austerities or one might not
engage in austerities (the Lalitavistara and the Mahāvastu consider only the first option of these two).
In the case of the first and second simile, this double statement just conveys the sense
that, unless sensuality is overcome, it is irrelevant if one engages in austerities or not,
since one will anyway to be able to reach awakening. In the case of the third simile,
however, the implication is that awakening is possible with austerities as well as without austerities.
Were it not for this last part of the statement made after the third simile, the whole set
of three similes would fit its present position, being simply an illustration of the need
to overcome sensuality as a necessary condition for asceticism to bear its fruit.
Whatever may be the final word on this passage, the Mahāsaccaka-sutta, the Sanskrit
fragment version, their Ekottarika-āgama parallel, the Lalitavistara, the Mahāvastu,
and the Sa�ghabhedavastu agree in reporting that the bodhisattva practised breath
control. According to the Mahāsaccaka-sutta and its Sanskrit fragment parallel, the
Buddha explained to Saccaka that the painful feelings that arose during this practice
did not affect his mind.
The Sa�ghabhedavastu also refers to the bodhisattva remaining unaffected and explains that this was because the bodhisattva had “developed the body”, [160] a point also
made in the Sanskrit fragment parallel to the Mahāsaccaka-sutta. [161]
This remark relates the exposition to the introductory topic of the Mahāsaccaka-sutta
and gives the impression that the account found in the Sa�ghabhedavastu might have
originated from a version of the Mahāsaccaka-sutta, since otherwise there would be
little reason for the Sa�ghabhedavastu to refer to development of the body in the present context.

MN I 242


238   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


MN I 245   The Mahāsaccaka-sutta reports that devas commented on the condition of the striving bodhisattva, wondering whether he was already dead or about to pass away. [162] At
first sight this passage seems to come out of order, since even though breath control
must have been an exhausting practice, a description of the appearance of the bodhisattva’s body as if he were close to death may seem to find a better placing after the prolonged fasting described later on in the Mahāsaccaka-sutta. [163]
A passage in the Mahāvastu, however, offers a perspective that would help to render
the sequence in the Mahāsaccaka-sutta understandable. According to this Mahāvastu
passage, the bodhisattva’s father had sent some of his men to follow the bodhisattva
and keep the king informed of his son’s undertakings and welfare. When the bodhisattva undertook the practice of breath control, these men had come to the conclusion that
he must be dead, since his breathing had stopped. [164]
The same interpretation would also fit the comment made by the devas in the Mahāsaccaka-sutta, who may have thought him to be dead or dying for the same reason.
That is, although the fasting practices would certainly have brought the bodhisattva to
a condition close to death, breath control might have resulted in a condition that outsiders could mistake for death.
According to the Mahāvastu, the bodhisattva’s father did not believe his messengers,
since he was convinced that the bodhisattva had not passed away but was rather in
deep concentration. [165] This would fit the reaction of some devas in the Mahāsaccakasutta, since unlike those devas who thought that the bodhisattva was dead or dying,
other devas believed that his condition was in conformity with the abiding of an arahant. [166] This type of comment could stem from a line of reasoning similar to that of the
bodhisattva’s father in the Mahāvastu.


162 [[MN36]] at MN I 245,1. Such a comment is not reported in the Sanskrit fragment parallel.
163 This suggestion would find support in [[EA31.8]] at T II 671a7, according to which the devas made their
comment on the bodhisattva’s death-like condition after he had undertaken his prolonged fast and
reached a state of extreme weakness. The same [[EA31.8]] at T II 671a12, however, takes up the practice
of breath control only after the devas comment on the bodhisattva’s state of extreme emaciation and
therewith also after his fasting. Thus the account in [[EA31.8]] is also not without difficulties, as with a
body weakened due to prolonged fasting it would have been difficult to undertake the practice of breath
control. Another support for associating the fasting practices with a condition near death can be gathered from the Mahāvastu, which after describing the pitiable condition of the bodhisattva due to his
fasting practices records how devas commented that he must be dead, as there was no strength left in
him, cf. Basak 1965: 324,7 or Senart 1890: 232,17: “when the devas had seen the weak body of the
hero, they said: ‘the sage is dead’”, devatā d���vā kāya� vīrasya durbala�, āhansu muni kālagato.
164 Basak 1965: 291,2 or Senart 1890: 208,4: “the prince is dead, he does not exhale or inhale”, kālagato
kumāro ti, no pi uśvasati na praśvasati.
165 According to the Mahāvastu, Senart 1890: 208,19, the king replied: “the prince is not dead, he has attained a peaceful concentration”, na kumāro kālagato, śānta� samādhi� samāpanno (Basak 1965: 292,3
reads śānti�). In a somewhat similar vein, Ps II 289,17 reports that, when the bodhisattva engaged in
ascetic practices, devas told his father that the prince had died, but King Suddhodana did not believe
them.
166 [[MN36]] at MN I 245,3: “the recluse Gotama is not dead, nor is he dying, the recluse Gotama is an ara

Chapter 4 Mahāyamaka-vagga                                  -  239


Support for this suggestion could be gathered from one of the two extant Chinese
translations of the Udāna-(varga), which contains a brief report of the future Buddha’s
ascetic practices and his subsequent awakening. This report indicates that devas came
to the conclusion that the bodhisattva was dead or else had reached the final goal on
seeing that he no longer breathed. [167]
The Mahāsaccaka-sutta, its Sanskrit fragment parallel, the Ekottarika-āgama version,
and the Sa�ghabhedavastu record that the bodhisattva also thought of going on a complete fast, but then decided to take only extremely small quantities of particular types
of food. According to these versions, the bodhisattva decided against complete fasting
because devas had offered to nourish him with divine food, if he should decide to completely abstain from food. [168] This offer prompted the bodhisattva to give up the plan of
undertaking a complete fast, as to allow devas to provide him with divine nourishment
would turn his claim to be fasting into a falsehood. [169]
The Lalitavistara and the Mahāvastu also report that the bodhisattva declined to be
fed by devas, although in their account this offer comes once the bodhisattva has decided to give up asceticism and to take nourishment. [170]
The Mahāsaccaka-sutta and its parallels agree in describing the physical condition of
the bodhisattva in similar terms, reporting his extreme state of emaciation and weakness. [171] After taking asceticism to its extremes, the bodhisattva reflected that he had
nevertheless not been able to reach awakening, a point at which he recalled a past jhāna experience.

The suggestion by Bronkhorst 1993/2000: 15 that according to [[EA31.8]] “the future Buddha intends to
fast to death” need not be the case, as the passage reads more naturally if one assumes the idea to be
simply to employ fasting as a way to reach awakening, without intending to fast to death.
169 The notion of receiving divine nourishment is a well-known motif in the Digambara Jain tradition, according to which an accomplished saint no longer partakes of ordinary human food, cf. Jaini 1979/
1998: 36 and Schubring 1962/2000: 61.
170 The Lalitavistara in Lefmann 1902: 264,4 or in Vaidya 1958b: 193,13 and the Mahāvastu in Basak

240,18. Dutoit 1905: 68 comments that this passage in the Mahāvastu and in the Lalitavistara would be
a later invention, caused by a shift of the idea of completely cutting off food to the end of the account
of the ascetic practices. The same Mahāvastu at a later point of its narration in Basak 1965: 322,11 or in
Senart 1890: 231,10 differs from its own earlier account, as it reports that the bodhisattva did go on a
complete fast for eighteen months, a��ādaśa māsā sarvaśo anāharatāye pratipanna�, a fast undertaken
after having lived for eighteen months on a single jujube fruit per day, for another eighteen months on a
single sesame seed per day, and for yet another eighteen months on a single grain of rice per day.
171 Cf. also Bapat 1923. For a comparable description of the condition of a Jain monk after prolonged fasting cf. the A�uttarovavāiyadasāo in Barnett 1907/1973: 130-133 (translated ibid. pp. 115-118).


240   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


According to the Mahāsaccaka-sutta, its Sanskrit fragment parallel, the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, the Mahāvastu, and the Sa�ghabhedavastu, the bodhisattva remembered a
first jhāna he had experienced before going forth. [172] The Ekottarika-āgama version and
the Lalitavistara differ in so far as according to them the bodhisattva on that former occasion attained not only the first, but all four jhānas, a suggestion made also in the Milindapañha. [173] Discourses in the Madhyama-āgama, the Buddhacarita, the Divyāvadāna, and several Chinese biographies of the Buddha agree with the Mahāsaccaka-sutta
that the bodhisattva only attained the first jhāna on that former occasion. [174]
The Mahāsaccaka-sutta and its Sanskrit fragment parallel report that this took place
when his father was engaged in work and the bodhisattva was seated under a Jambu
tree, [175] without specifying his age. The Pāli commentaries indicate that at this time the
bodhisattva was still an infant, with the Milindapañha suggesting that he was only one
month old. [176] In the Mahāvastu account of this former jhāna experience, however, the
bodhisattva is already a young man. [177] According to the sequence of events in the Buddhacarita and the Sa�ghabhedavastu, this first jhāna experience happened just before
he went forth. [178]

the bodhisattva already at this point would indeed seem somewhat exaggerated and would already equip
him with the meditational proficiency required for developing the three higher knowledges in the night
of his awakening.

dhātī, left him alone under the Jambu tree. This suggests that he must have been an infant, needing
nurses to look after him and being unable to walk on his own to the festival. According to Mil 289,26,
he was one month old, ekamāsiko samāno.
177 According to the Mahāvastu in Basak 1965: 64,4 or in Senart 1890: 45,4, before this experience of
absorption the bodhisattva took a stroll, bodhisatvo udyānabhūmīye anuca�kramanto, and then sat
down under the Jambu tree on his own. Moreover, the Mahāvastu in Basak 1965: 202,4 or in Senart
1890: 144,6 reports that the bodhisattva’s jhāna experience under the Jambu tree made his father anxious that the bodhisattva might want to go forth. In order to prevent this, the father sent women to the
bodhisattva, instructing them to entertain the bodhisattva with song and dance. These details indicate
that in the Mahāvastu account he is a young man already, otherwise the idea to entertain him with
women who sing and dance would not have occurred to the father.

Thus, according to most versions, the bodhisattva’s experience of the first jhāna took
place when he had already grown up. Representations of this first jhāna experience in
ancient Indian art also depict the bodhisattva as an adult, not as a small child. [179] This
would better fit the general sequence of events, since a jhāna experience just before
going forth could be seen as a powerful incentive for the bodhisattva to take the decisive step and embark on a spiritual life. [180] In contrast, a jhāna experienced as an infant
would not stand in such a direct relation to his decision to go forth. To decrease the age
at which this first jhāna was attained, however, clearly enhances the marvel of this experience. [181] Thus, perhaps the tendency of enhancing the marvels and wondrous feats
of the bodhisattva was responsible for the way the Pāli commentaries and the Milindapañha present the first jhāna experience of the bodhisattva. [182]
The individual Chinese translation that parallels part of the Mahāsaccaka-sutta differs from the other sources, as it places this first jhāna experience after the bodhisattva
had gone forth. [183] Notably, this placing would fit with the main thrust of the autobiographical account given by the Buddha in the Mahāsaccaka-sutta, whose purpose is to
illustrate that from the time of his going forth pleasant or painful feelings had not overwhelmed him. [184] From this perspective, it would be more natural for the Buddha to
bring up a jhāna experience he had after going forth, instead of a jhāna experience that
happened before he went forth. The great majority of sources, however, agree that this
jhāna experience happened before he went forth.

Johnston 1936/1995a: 46 and in the Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1977: 76,24, with its Chinese counterpart in T 1450 at T XXIV 114a19 (cf. also T 191 at T III 944b26) and its Tibetan counterpart in D (1)
’dul ba, nga 6b5 or Q (1030) ce 6a3, locate this experience after his four encounters with an old man, a
sick man, a dead man, and a monk.
179 This has already been noted by, e.g., Foucher 1903: 279 and Schlingloff 1987: 123; for representations
of this event cf., e.g., Foucher 1905: 340-348, figures 175 and 176, id. 1918: 217, figure 413, Huntington

180 Durt 1982: 115 concludes that a central element of this episode is the transforming effect this experience had on the bodhisattva.
181 Horsch 1964: 152 notes that to increase the age at which this experience took place would diminish the
marvel of the experience; cf. also, however, Foucher 1905: 346-347, who supposes that rappresentations of the meditation under the Jambu tree may have stimulated a tendency to increase the bodhisattva’s age in the textual traditions.
182 Klimkeit 1990: 73 suggests that another contributing factor could have been the idea that for the bodhisattva as a young man to be meditating when his father is engaged in a ceremonial ploughing seemed
unacceptable behaviour, a problem that disappears once he is held to have been too young to be able to
aid his father.

The bodhisattva’s memory of this first jhāna experience is also noteworthy since according to the traditional account, found for example in the Ariyapariyesanā-sutta, he
attained the sphere of nothingness and the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception under his two teachers Ā�āra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta. [185]
According to other discourses, mastery of the four jhānas is a precondition for being
able to reach any of the immaterial attainments. [186] This in turn implies that, for the bodhisattva to be able to attain these two immaterial spheres, he must have developed the
ability to attain all four jhānas at some earlier point during his quest for awakening or
while being with Ā�āra Kālāma, in which case one might wonder why he should now
recall only a first jhāna experience. [187]
A closer inspection of the formulation in the Mahāsaccaka-sutta makes it clear that
the point at stake is not the first jhāna as such. The decisive insight obtained by the bodhisattva at this point rather appears to be that the happiness experienced during jhāna
need not be feared, as this happiness is aloof from sensual attraction. [188] From this perspective, it would be less important whether the jhāna he remembered took place before or after he went forth, in fact a jhāna experienced before his going forth would be
a fitting starting point for developing a new approach to awakening, as this experience
happened spontaneously and without a teacher.
In contrast, any jhāna practice undertaken under the tuition of Ā�āra Kālāma would
presumably have been experienced with a particular perspective on the nature and significance of the experience of jhāna, perhaps considering jhāna as merely a steppingstone to the immaterial attainments. From such a perspective, the happiness of the first
jhāna may have been perceived as something coarse that one needs to leave behind,
since to indulge in such happiness could become a hindrance for further progress towards the immaterial attainments.
The bodhisattva’s insight into the nature of the happiness of jhāna would stand in
contrast to such an attitude and also in contrast to his earlier belief that freedom from


185 The bodhisattva’s reflection in [[MN26]] at MN I 165,12 indicates that what Ā�āra Kālāma taught was the
full-fledged attainment of the sphere of nothingness, as this attainment is specified to lead to rebirth in
the sphere of nothingness, ākiñcaññāyatanūpapatti. The ability of Ā�āra Kālāma to attain profound levels
of concentration is confirmed in the Mahāparinibbāna-sutta, according to which he was able to enter
such deep concentration that he did not even notice five hundred carts passing by close to him, cf. [[DN16]] at DN II 130,11 and its parallels [[DA2]] at T I 19a12, T 5 at T I 168b3, T 6 at T I 183c15, T 7 at T I
197c13 (only fifty chariots), and the Sanskrit version in [[SN360]] folio 190V2 in Waldschmidt 1950: 27
(not all Chinese versions explicitly identify him as Ā�āra Kālāma).
186 Cf., e.g., [[DN33]] at DN III 265,18, which presents the four jhānas and the four immaterial attainments as
part of a set of nava anupubbavihārā, an expression that indicates that these levels of concentration are
to be attained in progressive succession.
187 This problem is raised by Ireland 1998: 195.
188 [[MN36]] at MN I 247,3: “I am not afraid of this happiness, as this happiness is apart from sensuality and
unwholesome states”, na kho aha� tassa sukhassa bhāyāmi, ya� ta� sukha� aññatr’ eva kāmehi aññatra akusalehi dhammehi (C [e] -MN I 584,4 and S [e] -MN I 458,5: yanta�, after which S [e] continues directly with aññatr’ eva, without mentioning sukha�).


Chapter 4 Mahāyamaka-vagga                                  -  243


dukkha cannot be reached through something that involves the experience of happiness. [189] The decisive insight at the present junction of events thus appears to be that
happiness per se is not a problem, as wholesome types of happiness can be conducive
to awakening. [190]
This shift of perspective throws into relief the all-important distinction between what
is wholesome and what is unwholesome, a distinction that runs like a red thread through
the early discourses. Based on this shift of perspective, the bodhisattva would then have
used the same jhānas that earlier led him to the immaterial attainments as a basis for
developing the three higher knowledges.
His attainment of the four jhānas and the three higher knowledges is described in
similar terms in the Mahāsaccaka-sutta, its Sanskrit fragment parallel, their Ekottarika-āgama parallel, and the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya. [191]
The individual Chinese translation, the Lalitavistara, and the Mahāvastu differ in that
they present the first and second higher knowledges in the opposite sequence. Thus ac
189 [[MN85]] at MN II 93,15: “before my awakening ... it occurred to me: ‘happiness will not be reached
through [a practice that involves] happiness, happiness will be reached [only] through [a practice that
involves] pain”, mayham ... pubbe va sambodhā ... etad ahosi, na kho sukhena sukha� adhigantabba�,
dukkhena kho sukha� adhigantabban ti.

190 Cf., e.g., [[MN66]] at MN I 454,23 and its parallel [[MA192]] at T I 743a15, which qualify the happiness of
the jhānas to be the “happiness of complete awakening”, sambodhasukha (S [e] -MN II 190,7: sambodhisukha), or more precisely the “happiness that leads to complete awakening”, .
191 [[MN36]] at MN I 247,17, fragment 337r4 in Liu 2009: 59, [[EA31.8]] at T II 671c27, and T 1428 at T XXII
781a23. Vetter 1996: 62 notes that the specification which in [[MN36]] at MN I 247,33 is applied to each
jhāna, according to which such kind of pleasant feeling, sukhā vedanā, did not affect the bodhisattva’s
mind, would not fit the case of the fourth jhāna. The corresponding passage in fragment 337v7 in Liu
2009: 60 instead qualifies the feelings experienced (in relation to each of the four absorptions) as peaceful and agreeable, śāntā� śubhā�. Another problem is highlighted by Schmithausen 1981: 222 note
75, who draws attention to a grammatical peculiarity in the presentation of these three higher knowledges, where [[MN36]] at MN I 248,1+21 and MN I 249,6 introduces each of the higher knowledges with
an aorist form, abhininnāmesi�, but then continues in the case of the first two knowledges in the present tense, MN I 248,2+13: anussarāmi, MN I 248,22+24+34: passāmi and pajānāmi 正覺之樂 . Only in relation to
the third knowledge does [[MN36]] proceed with aorist forms, cf. MN I 249,7+8+9+10+11+12+13+18:
abhaññāsi�. The Mahāvastu similarly introduce the first higher knowledge with abhinirnāmaye (in
Basak 1965: 389,12 or in Senart 1890: 283,14), but then continue with present tense forms, such as paśyati (Basak 1965: 389,13 and 390,8 or Senart 1890: 283,15 and 284,4), prajānati (Basak 1965: 389,14 or
Senart 1890: 283,16), and jānāti (Basak 1965: 390,9 or Senart 1890: 284,5). In relation to the second
higher knowledge, the Mahāvastu employs abhinirnāmayesi (Basak 1965: 390,11 or Senart 1890: 284,7)
and samanusmare (Basak 1965: 390,12 or Senart 1890: 284,8), but then reads anusmarati (Basak 1965:
391,5 or Senart 1890: 284,14). The occurrence of the same pattern in [[MN36]] and the Mahāvastu suggests this aspect of the description of the first two higher knowledges to be fairly ancient. A possible
explanation could be that these different forms are the outcome of a reciter’s error, who might have unintentionally applied the formula used in descriptions of the gradual path, found, e.g., in [[MN27]] at MN
I 182,19, to the present account of past events. Another explanation could be that the use of the present
tense stands for the historical present and expresses the fact that, whereas the destruction of the influxes
is a historically unique event that takes place only once, the other two higher knowledges are experiences that can be attained again and again.

cording to these versions, the bodhisattva first attained the divine eye and only after that
did he develop recollection of his own past lives. [192]
The Sa�ghabhedavastu’s account agrees with the sequence of the higher knowledges
found in the Mahāsaccaka-sutta. It differs, however, in so far as it reports that the
bodhisattva acquired all six supernormal knowledges (abhiñña), which in addition to
the three higher knowledges comprise the exercise of supernormal powers, the divine
ear, and telepathic knowledge of others’ minds. [193]


192 T 757 at T XVII 599b20, Lefmann 1902: 344,9 or Vaidya 1958b: 250,12, Basak 1965: 184,12 and
389,13 or Senart 1890: 132,6 and 283,15. The same sequence recurs in the Mahāvastu account of the
awakening of the previous Buddha Dīpa�kara, cf. Basak 1963a: 282,1 or Senart 1882a: 228,13. The
Buddhacarita stanza 14:2+7 in Johnston 1936/1995a: 157-158, however, agrees with the sequence in
[[MN36]] as it first mentions recollection of past lives and only then the divine eye. For variations in the
sequence of the three higher knowledges in the context of listings of the six abhiññās cf. Dayal 1932/
1970: 107-108.
193 Gnoli 1977: 116,20. A similar presentation recurs in a Sanskrit fragment in Waldschmidt 1960/1967:
406-408. Yet another perspective can be found in [[AN9.41]] at AN IV 448,13, according to which the
Buddha only claimed to be fully awakened after being able to attain the four jhānas, the four immaterial attainments, and the attainment of cessation. After his apprenticeship under Uddaka Rāmaputta, the
Buddha would have been able to enter the eight attainments, which thus leaves only the attainment of
cessation for the night of his awakening. Notably, the description of his attainment of cessation in [[AN9.41]] at AN IV 448,7 reads āsavā parikkhaya� agama�su, thereby using an aorist form that differs
from the standard formulation parikkhī�ā honti. According to Somaratne 2003: 214, in the standard description “the past participle (parikkhī�ā) + the historical present honti may express the pluperfect in
Pāli: what had happened at that time, what had been done. Taking parikkhī�ā honti as a pluperfect, we
might interpret the stock passage to mean [that] when the person attained cessation, he had already destroyed the mental corruptions”; for a criticism of this suggestion cf. Schmithausen 2000a: 39 note 69.
Somaratne 2003: 216 explains that the reading āsavā parikkhaya� agama�su in [[AN9.41]] implies that
here “the Buddha is talking about a past experience where he achieved the cessation for the first time”.
This past experience would then have coincided with his attainment of full liberation, whereas in the
standard descriptions of the attainment of cessation in other discourses this need not be the case, as the
destruction of the influxes might also precede such attainment. Wynne 2002: 31 concludes that the
description in [[AN9.41]] “means that the Buddha attained liberation whilst in the state of cessation”. As
Somaratne 2006b: 750 points out, cessation is simply a particularly thorough mode of experiencing
Nirvā�a. Thus, for the Buddha’s awakening to take place through the experience of cessation would
entail that his insight into the four noble truths ([[SN56.11]] at SN V 423,4), and in particular his realization of the third noble truth, namely his experience of Nirvā�a, took place by way of attaining cessation. This would at the same time have been his insight into the dependent cessation of dukkha and
therewith the completion of his knowledge of the principle of pa�icca samuppāda (described in detail in
Vin I 1,7 or [[UD1.1]] at [[UD1.8]]). Out of this experience of Nirvā�a in the night of his awakening, all the
other insights related to his awakening would have arisen as by-products of the same experience, be
these insight into the elements ([[SN14.31]] at SN II 170,28 and [[SN14.32]] at SN II 172,5), into the aggregates ([[SN22.26]] at SN III 28,26, [[SN22.27]] at SN III 29,25 and [[SN22.56]] at SN III 59,8), into the sensespheres ([[SN35.13]] at SN IV 7,28, [[SN35.14]] at SN IV 8,24, [[SN35.15]] at SN IV 9,29, [[SN35.16]] at SN IV
10,20, and [[SN48.28]] at SN V 206,1), into the faculties ([[SN48.21]] at SN V 204,5), into the world ([[AN3.101]] at AN I 259,5+26), or into heavenly realms ([[AN8.64]] at AN IV 304,22). De Silva 1987a: 49 compares the Buddha’s awakening to a “circular vision, as when one is at the top of a mountain ... however
different the sceneries may be from the different directions, all the scenes constitute one integrated ex

Chapter 4 Mahāyamaka-vagga                                  -  245


When evaluating the variations found in regard to the sequence of these three higher
knowledges, it could be noted that according to all versions the starting point for the
development of the three higher knowledges was the bodhisattva’s realization of the
futility of his ascetic practices. This realization appears to have come as a result of
reviewing what he had done so far. That is, reviewing what he had undertaken so far
and searching for an alternative approach to liberation, he would eventually have remembered his former first jhāna experience. Once he had come to the point of recalling an event that according to the majority of sources would have taken place previous
to his going forth, it would be natural to extend the same line of investigation further
into the past by recollecting his past lives. Due to the mastery of the four jhāna acquired earlier, this would, according to early Buddhist meditation theory, have been
within relatively easy reach and thus a natural option to continue his inquiry.
This would fit the sequence proposed in the Mahāsaccaka-sutta, its Sanskrit fragment parallel, the Ekottarika-āgama parallel, and the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, according to which recollection of past lives was the first of the three higher knowledges developed in the night of the Buddha’s awakening.
Once he had in this way gained insight into his own sa�sāric past, to develop the divine eye as a way of ascertaining the same causes and conditions operative in the lives
of others would come in its proper place. [194]
This sequence finds support in the Sa�ghabhedavastu, which offers additional details
on the relationship between the three higher knowledges. According to its report, once
the bodhisattva had recollected his past lives, he wanted to ascertain the underlying
cause of this sa�sāric process. [195] Developing the higher knowledge of the arising and
passing away of beings provided an answer to this, since it revealed to him that beings
migrate through sa�sāra in accordance with their karmic deeds. Based on this comprehensive vision of the continuous passing away and being reborn of beings in sa�sā
perience of a person standing on a vantage point”. Taken together, then, these various facets would
have been the basis for the Buddha’s claim that he had indeed accomplished full awakening, a certainty
that would have arisen on retrospective review of the implications of the actual event of awakening.
194 Ergardt 1977: 86 draws attention to a crescendo effect involved in the verbs used in this description,
which proceed from anussarati used at MN I 248,2+13 for recollection of past lives to pajānāti used at
MN I 248,24+36 for the divine eye, and then culminates in MN I 249,7+8+9+10+11+12+13+18 in abhijānāti used in relation to the destruction of the influxes. He comments that these verbs “denote a series of
intensified knowledges related to release”, a detail that fits well with the sequence of the three higher
knowledges found in [[MN36]] [[EA31.8]] and T 1428.
195 Gnoli 1977: 118,11. The reference to cyutyupapādajñā�a as something the bodhisattva developed in the
night of his awakening needs to be considered together with the suggestion in the same Sa�ghabhedavastu that already at his birth the bodhisattva had been endowed with the divine eye, cf. Gnoli 1977:
52,7: sāmpratajāto bodhisattva ... divyena cak�u�ā samanvāgato; cf. also its Chinese counterpart in T
191 at T III 940c18 and [[DN14]] at DN II 20,12, which makes a similar statement for the former Buddha
Vipassī. Thus, from the perspective of the Sa�ghabhedavastu account, it seems that the bodhisattva did
not develop this knowledge in the night of his awakening anew, but instead deepened an ability he already had and directed it to a particular object, namely to the arising and passing away of beings in accordance with their deeds.


246   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


ra, [196] according to the Sa�ghabhedavastu the bodhisattva understood that the operating
mechanism behind sa�sāric migration are the three influxes of sensuality, of [desire
for] existence, and of ignorance. [197] The Sa�ghabhedavastu continues by indicating that
once the bodhisattva knew that these three influxes need to be eradicated, he developed
insight into the four noble truths, eradicated the influxes, and reached full liberation,
thereby going beyond any future transmigration in sa�sāra. [198]
The Mahāsaccaka-sutta and its Sanskrit fragment parallel report that at the conclusion of the Buddha’s autobiographical report of his progress to awakening, Saccaka
asked if the Buddha would sometimes take a nap during the day, which the Buddha admitted. When Saccaka commented that this was considered by some as a sign of delusion, the Buddha clarified that one who has abandoned the influxes has gone beyond
delusion. Saccaka noted with approval that the Buddha had not displayed any irritation
on being challenged in this way, [199] delighted in the Buddha’s words and left. [200]


[[MN37]] Cū�ata�hāsa�khaya-sutta

The Cū�ata�hāsa�khaya-sutta, the “lesser discourse on the destruction of craving”,
records a visit paid by Mahāmoggallāna to Sakka, the king of gods. [201] This discourse


196 Bronkhorst 2007: 144, however, holds that “the first and second knowledge ... have no obvious and intrinsic connection with liberation”, assuming that their purpose is only to attribute to the Buddha “a confirmation that the doctrine of rebirth and karmic retribution is true”.
197 Gnoli 1977: 118,27. A complementary perspective on this insight can be found in the same Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1977: 158,10, according to which the Buddha affirmed that his insight into the conditioning force of volitional formations as the factor responsible for rebirth was based on his knowledge
of the arising and passing away of beings. That is, the second knowledge achieved in the night of his
awakening appears to have been the basis for the Buddha’s proclamation of the dependent arising of
sa�sāric existence (while the dependent cessation of sa�sāric existence would have become clear to
him with the attainment of the third higher knowledge). A complementary facet of the same insight is
highlighted by Jayatilleke 1968: 316, who comments that “the awareness of the nature of the operations
of karma is said to be the second ... knowledge (dutiyā vijjā) obtained by the Buddha on the night of his
enlightenment”. Lopez 1992: 32 comments that with the divine eye “the bodhisattva sees, rather than

the universe”.
198 Gnoli 1977: 118,30. The Mahāvastu in Basak 1965: 186,12 and 391,13 or in Senart 1890: 133,11 and
285,2 additionally specifies that the Buddha’s awakening took place within a single mind moment, ekacittak�a�a, a specification found also in the Lalitavistara in Lefmann: 350,14 or in Vaidya 1958b:
253,19.
199 While [[MN36]] at MN I 250,27 contrasts such composure with the irritation displayed by the six contemporary teachers on being challenged by Saccaka (Pūra�a Kassapa, etc.), the Sanskrit fragment
339v1 in Liu 2009: 62 appears to have referred to recluses and Brahmins in general.
200 In the Sanskrit fragment, Saccaka delivers a set of similes to illustrate his defeat, found at the conclusion of [[MN35]] and its parallels (cf. above p. 230). The fragment also records that he had gained faith in
the Buddha, 339v7 in Liu 2009: 62: tasmin khalu dharmapa[ryā]ye bhā�yamā�e sātyakir nirgranthīputro buddhe ’bhiprasanno dharma sa�ghe ’bhiprasanna�.
201 On the role of Sakka in early Buddhism cf., e.g., Arunasiri 2006, Barua 1967: 183-184, Bingenheimer


Chapter 4 Mahāyamaka-vagga                                  -  247


has two Chinese parallels, found in the Sa�yukta-āgama and in the Ekottarika-āgama. [202]
The Majjhima-nikāya and Ekottarika-āgama versions begin by narrating that Sakka paid a visit to the Buddha and asked how a monk can reach the destruction of craving. [203] According to the Majjhima-nikāya version, the Buddha replied that a monk, who
has heard that nothing is worth adhering to, develops direct understanding and contemplates the three types of feeling in terms of impermanence, fading away, cessation, and
relinquishment. Contemplating in this way he goes beyond clinging as well as agitation
and attains Nirvā�a.
The Ekottarika-āgama account similarly instructs to avoid clinging to anything and
to contemplate the three feelings as impermanent and subject to cessation, a contemplation that leads beyond agitation and issues in realizing Nirvā�a. [204] The Ekottarika-āgama version provides an additional perspective on how to avoid clinging to any dharma,
as it indicates that freedom from clinging comes about through insight into the empty
nature of dharmas. [205] Another difference is that in the Ekottarika-āgama version avoiding worldly perceptions leads from contemplating the three feelings to the transcendence of agitation required for realising Nirvā�a. [206]
The Sa�yukta-āgama version does not record the instruction given by the Buddha at
all. Instead, this version begins by relating that Mahāmoggallāna, who was in solitary
seclusion on Mount Vulture Peak, remembered that on a former occasion Sakka had
approached the Buddha and inquired about the destruction of craving. [207] The three ver

1974: 146, Masson 1942: 45-52, Rahula 1978: 164-165, and Verpoorten 2010: 178-180.
202 The parallels are [[SA505]] at T II 133b-134a and [[EA19.3]] at T II 593c-594c. While [[MN37]] locates the
discourse in the Hall of Migāra’s Mother by Sāvatthī, [[SA505]] takes place in Rājagaha and [[EA19.3]] has
Jeta’s Grove as its location. [[SA505]] has been translated in Anālayo 2011f, [[EA19.3]] has been translated
by Huyen-Vi 1998: 65-70. Akanuma 1929/1990: 58 gives “craving’s destruction”,, as a tentative
title for [[SA505]] The summary verse at T II 596c13 refers to [[EA19.3]] as “the abandoning of craving”,
.
203 Sakka’s reference to the destruction of craving at the outset of [[MN37]] at MN I 251,17 takes up a theme
already broached towards the end of a discussion that according to [[DN21]] at DN II 283,9 took place
during his first meeting with the Buddha. This suggests the present discourse to be a follow up of their
earlier discussion, cf. in more detail Anālayo 2011f. For depictions of this earlier visit in art cf., e.g.,
the survey in Coomaraswamy 1928b.
204 My presentation of the Ekottarika-āgama instruction is based on a comparison of the three instances of
this instruction in [[EA19.3]] at T II 593c18, T II 594b12, and T II 594c3, which record the instruction
given by the Buddha to Sakka, the repetition of these instructions by Sakka to Mahāmoggallāna, and 愛盡
another repetition of these instructions by the Buddha to Mahāmoggallāna. These three instances differ
斷愛 considerably from each other, even though they are records of the same statement. A comparison of all
three instances shows that the remark in Huyen-Vi 1998: 65 note 4 that the instruction in [[EA19.3]] “substantially differs from the Pāli” applies especially to the first instance in [[EA19.3]] at T II 593c18; on the
version of the present passage found at T II 594c3 cf. also Pāsādika 2010: 88.

sions agree that Mahāmoggallāna decided to visit the heaven of the Thirty-three to find
out if Sakka had taken the Buddha’s instruction to heart.

MN I 252   The Cū�ata�hāsa�khaya-sutta and its parallels report that Sakka welcomed Mahāmoggallāna, the Majjhima-nikāya discourse specifying that Sakka took a lower seat to
sit down, [208] after having offered a seat to Mahāmoggallāna.
The Majjhima-nikāya version also describes that, when Mahāmoggallāna arrived,
Sakka was surrounded by “five hundred [types of] heavenly instruments”. [209] The counterpart to this description in the Sa�yukta-āgama clarifies that Sakka was bathing in a
pond together with five hundred celestial maidens, who were entertaining him with
song. [210]
According to all versions, Mahāmoggallāna asked Sakka to repeat the Buddha’s instruction on the destruction of craving. Sakka, however, evaded rehearsing the instruction he had received by indicating that he was busy. [211] The Sa�yukta-āgama version


208 [[MN37]] at MN I 252,28: sakko ... aññatara� nīca� āsana� gahetvā ekamanta� nisīdi. Wagle 1985: 60
explains that in “encounters involving the Buddha and the gods, the ... standard description ... is that the
gods ... stand on one side”. A departure from this pattern can be found in Catu�pari�at-sūtra fragment
[[SN360]] folio 90V2 in Waldschmidt 1952: 13, which reports that Śakra once sat down when visiting the
Buddha. Wagle 1985: 61 notes another such case in [[DN32]] at DN III 194,10+14+15+16+17, where the
four Heavenly Kings and a following of various spirits sit down in the presence of the Buddha, which
Wagle considers to be a “later interpolation by the compilers”. While the corresponding Sanskrit fragment 531,11V3 in Hoffmann 1939: 13 and the Tibetan version in Skilling 1994a: 462,9 also report that
a Heavenly King sat down, [e](kānte nya)�(ī)dat and phyogs gcig tu ’dug go, according to the Chinese
version in T 1245 at T XXI 217a10 he stood at one side, . Similar variations occur when the
meeting takes place in a heavenly realm and not on earth. Thus in [[DN14]] at DN II 50,16 and in [[SN55.20]] at SN V 368,2 a group of devas remain standing in the presence of the Buddha who has come to
visit them, as is the case for [[DA1]] at T I 10b14 (parallel to [[DN14]]), whereas [[SA1135]] at T II 299b18
(parallel to [[SN55.20]]) reports that the devas sat down. In the Pāli version of the same encounter at Vin I
26,24, however, Sakka remains standing. Variations can also be observed in the case of encounters that
do not involve the Buddha, where devas tend to remain standing when visiting humans. Thus, for example, in [[SN11.9]] at SN I 226,22 (or SN [2] 255 at SN [2] I 488,2), Sakka remains standing when conversing
with humans. Sakka and his following also remain standing on the occasions of other visits of Mahāmoggallāna to their realm, described in [[SN40.10]] at SN IV 270,2, [[SN55.18]] at SN V 366,18, and [[SN55.19]] at SN V 367,19. In [[SA507]] at T II 134c26 (parallel to [[SN55.18]]) four 住立一面 devas visit Mahāmoggallāna and sit down to converse with him. In [[AN6.34]] at AN III 332,16 and [[AN7.53]] at AN IV 76,7, Mahāmoggallāna visits a Brahmā and in both instances the latter sits down. If it was indeed considered
customary for devas to remain standing on the occasion of meeting humans, departures from such a
pattern could be the result of transmission errors, where during the process of transmission of the discourses the pericope “he sat down”, used so frequently when describing human visitors who come to
see the Buddha or his disciples, may have been applied to passages that originally spoke of remaining
in the standing posture.

reports that he even somewhat wittily suggested that Mahāmoggallāna might best approach the Buddha with this question, so that, after having heard it from the Buddha,
Mahāmoggallāna could remember it accordingly. [212]
The three versions report that Sakka invited Mahāmoggallāna for a tour of the heavenly palace. [213] In the Majjhima-nikāya and Ekottarika-āgama versions, Sakka explained
that a former victory over the asuras had been the occasion for constructing this palace,
an explanation not given in the Sa�yukta-āgama version. [214]
The Majjhima-nikāya version reports that when Sakka’s celestial maidens saw Mahāmoggallāna approaching the palace, they felt ashamed and retired into their room. [215]
The Sa�yukta-āgama account offers additional details that explain their embarrassment. According to its report, these celestial maidens had seen Sakka approaching the
palace from afar and had come forward dancing and singing. [216] On coming closer they
realized that Sakka was in the company of a monk, which caused them to withdraw in
embarrassment. That is, their embarrassment was due to having acted in the presence
of a monk in a way considered improper.
The Majjhima-nikāya and Sa�yukta-āgama versions agree in comparing the embarrassment of Sakka’s maiden to the embarrassment a woman experiences on seeing her
father-in-law.
The same simile occurs also in a discourse in the Madhyama-āgama (not otherwise
related to the Cū�ata�hāsa�khaya-sutta), which specifies that the woman who is embarrassed on meeting her father-in-law is “newly married”. [217] A discourse in the A�guttara-nikāya explains that a newly married woman – who according to traditional customs goes to live with her husband – will be abashed and ashamed in the presence of


MN I 594,28: ya�). In [[SA505]] at T II 133c11, however, he indicated that “sometimes [I] recall a previous matter, sometimes [I] do not remember [it]”, and according to [[EA19.3]] at T
II 594a10 he explained that “what has been heard by me is quickly forgotten”, .
The Chinese renderings could be due to a misunderstanding of the negation no for being the first person
plural of the personal pronoun, as it is not unusual for kings and devas to refer to themselves in this
way. That the proper sense should be that Sakka had not forgotten, however, suggests itself from the
later part of [[MN37]] and [[EA19.3]] which make it clear that he did remember the Buddha’s instruction.

213 Arunasiri 2006: 633 comments that this invitation for a tour of the palace appears to have been “to divert the attention of the elder elsewhere”, i.e., away from the question he had asked and thereby away
from the topic of the destruction of craving.

216 [[SA505]] at T II 133c16. Sakka’s maidens coming forward dancing and then withdrawing in embarrassment on realizing that they are in the presence of a monk is also mentioned in a set of stanzas by Mahāmoggallāna in [[MA131]] at T I 622b14. A stone carving on a pillar of the stūpa of Bharhut vividly depicts the Vejayanta palace as a three-storied building with beautiful maidens looking out of its windows
and other beautiful maidens in front of the building dancing to the accompaniment of music; cf. Cunningham 1879: 109 and 118 and plate 16. Although this stone carving does not bear any explicit relation to the present discourse, its charming representation would fit the present scene only too well.

her in-laws. [218] These passages help clarifying the import of the comparison drawn in
the Cū�ata�hāsa�khaya-sutta and its Sa�yukta-āgama parallel between the embarrassment of Sakka’s celestial maidens and the embarrassment of a – presumably ‘newly’ –
married woman.
According to the Cū�ata�hāsa�khaya-sutta and its parallels, Mahāmoggallāna acknowledged that the beauty of the palace was a fruit of Sakka’s merits. In the Pāli version, he remarks that whenever humans see anything lovely, they associate this with
the splendour of the gods of the Thirty-three. [219] The Ekottarika-āgama discourse reports
him comparing Sakka’s behaviour to human beings who for any small fortune start
congratulating each other, followed by explaining that Sakka’s palace and those small
fortunes are just the outcome of previous good deeds. [220] In this way, the Ekottarikaāgama version makes explicit what seems to be implicit in the Pāli version, namely
that instead of bragging about his present fortune and possessions, Sakka should be
more concerned with the type of wholesome action that results in such fortune.

MN I 254   As this first attempt to arouse Sakka from his smugness did not have an effect, according to all versions Mahāmoggallāna decided to use stronger means to shake Sakka’s complacency by undertaking a supernormal feat and shaking the heavenly palace
with his toe. The Majjhima-nikāya and Ekottarika-āgama versions report that after this


218 [[AN7.56]] at AN II 78,20. Wagle 1966: 93 explains that “a bride on marriage goes to the family of her
husband which is alien to her” (although Jain 1947: 160 notes exceptions to this general pattern). While
“she sees her husband and his parents as a single category to whom she owes respect and obedience”,
they in turn “see her as an alien coming to seek membership”. Hence, a newly married woman may indeed feel embarrassed and ashamed in the presence of her in-laws. Von Hinüber 1993: 102 draws attention to Vin IV 21,3, where a mother-in-law addresses her daughter-in-law with je, an expression elsewhere used to address a female slave, cf., e.g., [[MN21]] at MN I 125,18. Norman 1994/1996: 58 adds that
the same je is also used to address a courtesan, cf., e.g., [[DN14]] at DN II 96,14+19 (on prostitution in ancient India cf., e.g., Bhattacharji 1987). This form of address reflects the low social position of a daughter-in-law in the household of her in-laws. Horner 1930/1990: 1 explains: “since performance of the funeral rites was thought to be essential to a man’s future happiness, he usually married chiefly in order
to gain this end”, i.e., to have a son who could perform the funeral rites. “He regarded his wife simply as
a child-bearer”, as a consequence of which “her life was spent in complete subservience to her husband
and his parents. She was allowed little authority at home and no part in public activities”. On feelings
of embarassment or shame by a newly married woman in ancient India society cf. also Hara 2006: 146.

this passage as: “people seeing anything delightful speak thus: ‘Indeed it shines forth from the devas of
the Thirty-three’”, while Ñā�amoli 1995/2005: 346 translates it as: “whenever human beings see anything lovely, they say: ‘Sirs, it does credit to the gods of the Thirty-three!’”. My résumé of this sentence
is oriented on the readings found in B [e] -MN I 320,16 and S [e] -MN I 467,19: sobhati vata bho yathā devāna� tāvati�sānan ti, cf. also Neumann 1896/1995: 282, who translates: “die Menschen sagen ja, wenn

supernormal feat Mahāmoggallāna asked again for the instruction delivered by the Buddha. Stirred by the feat performed by Mahāmoggallāna, Sakka right away repeated the
instruction he had received earlier from the Buddha. [221]
The Sa�yukta-āgama discourse differs in so far as it already concludes after the supernormal feat, reporting only that Sakka explained to his celestial maidens that Mahāmoggallāna was not his teacher but a co-disciple, [222] a clarification made also in the
Cū�ata�hāsa�khaya-sutta. [223]
The Majjhima-nikāya and Ekottarika-āgama versions continue by reporting how
Mahāmoggallāna approached the Buddha and requested another repetition of the instruction on the destruction of craving. [224] This request is puzzling, since according to
both versions he had been sitting close to the Buddha when Sakka came and received
this instruction in the first place. [225] Thus, Mahāmoggallāna’s intention to find out if
Sakka had rightly understood and remembered this instruction would have been fulfilled once Sakka had properly repeated it, without any further need to check with the
Buddha. Moreover, according to a discourse in the A�guttara-nikāya and its parallels
this particular instruction should have been quite familiar to Mahāmoggallāna, as in
these discourses it forms the culmination point of a teaching he received from the Buddha previous to his own attainment of awakening and therewith previous to the events
recorded in the present discourse. [226]


[[MN38]] Mahāta�hāsa�khaya-sutta

The Mahāta�hāsa�khaya-sutta, the “greater discourse on the destruction of craving”,
gives a detailed exposition of dependent arising (pa�icca samuppāda). This discourse
has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama. [227] A few lines of this discourse have also been
preserved in Sanskrit fragments. [228]

224 [[MN37]] at MN I 255,15 and [[EA19.3]] at T II 594b27.
225 [[MN37]] and [[EA19.3]] report that, when visiting Sakka, Mahāmoggallāna referred to the contents of the
instruction given by the Buddha, cf. [[MN37]] at MN I 252,32: “the Blessed One spoke in brief [concerning] liberation through the destruction of craving”, bhagavā sa�khittena ta�hāsa�khayavimutti� abhāsi, and [[EA19.3]] at T II 594a7: “the Blessed One gave you the teaching on eradicating craving and desires”, . This suggests that, when he was sitting close by while the Buddha instructed Sakka, Mahāmoggallāna had already heard what the Buddha said.
226 [[AN7.58]] at AN IV 88,12 and its parallels [[MA83]] at T I 560b4 and T 47 at T I 837c5.
227 The parallel is [[MA201]] at T I 766b-770a, which agrees with [[MN38]] on locating the discourse in Jeta’s
Grove by Sāvatthī. [[MA201]] is entitled after the monk Sāti, who in both versions is the cause for the
delivery of the discourse ( according to a, and variant). A discourse quotation in the
Dharmaskandha also entitles the discourse after this monk, T 1537 at T XXVI 507c8:, the
corresponding Sanskrit fragment 4737 folio 5v10 in Dietz 1984: 34,1 reads ukta� bhagavatā svāti�

252   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


MN I 256 The Mahāta�hāsa�khaya-sutta and its parallel in the Madhyama-āgama report in
similar ways that the monk Sāti, [229] who thought that according to the Buddha the same
consciousness transmigrates through the round of rebirths, [230] upheld his view even when
told by other monks that this was in contradiction to the Buddha’s teaching. According
to both versions, the monks presented the matter to the Buddha, who called Sāti to his
presence and rebuked him for his obstinate adhering to such a misrepresentation of the
teachings. [231]

MN I 259   The two discourses continue with the Buddha explaining that consciousness is a dependently arisen phenomenon, reckoned according to the sense in dependence on which
it arises, just as fire is reckoned according to its fuel. [232]

MN I 260   According to the Mahāta�hāsa�khaya-sutta and its parallel, the Buddha next engaged the other monks, present on this occasion, in a catechism on the dependent nature of
what has “come to be”. [233] The commentary explains that the Buddha used this expres

known among well instructed lay disciples, T 1435 at T XXIII 174b21:, glossed
as . The Chinese Udāna collection, T 212 at T IV 734c16, has a discourse quotation from
the, a formulation that reminds of the title of [[MN38]] which it allocates to a Madhyama-āgama, although the quote itself takes up different types of rebirth.
228 SHT V 1114 (pp. 108-109) and SHT V 1166 (pp. 162-163; cf. also SHT VII p. 284 and SHT VIII p.
197). SHT V 1114 and SHT V 1166 parallel the discussion at MN I 256,31; SHT V 1114 also has parts
of the exchange at MN I 258,14. For a discourse quote in Abhidh-k-� cf. below note 242.
229 [[MN38]] at MN I 256,12 qualifies Sāti as a “fisherman’s son”, keva��aputta, which [[MA201]] at T I 766c2
renders as . Rhys Davids 1901: 866 explains that in ancient India “trades and crafts were very
largely hereditary ... families are frequently referred to in terms of their traditional calling, just as a man
is often described ... in terms of his father’s trade: ‘Sāti the fisherman’s son’ for ‘Sāti the fisherman’ 室唳咆那都叉耶時月提 ”.

766c 大愛之本末所說 3: . Norman 1991/1993a: 256 draws attention to passages that reflect ideas
similar to Sāti’s view, found in the B�hadāra�yaka Upani�ad 4.4.2 and 4.4.22, according to which
when life ends and the senses cease, the ‘being’ departs as consciousness, sa vijñāno bhavati, sa vijñānam evānvavakrāmati, followed by identifying consciousness as the great unborn self, sa vā e�a mahān
aja ātmā yo ’ya� vijñānamaya� prā�e�u, cf. Radhakrishnan 1953/1992: 270 and 278.

vedeyyo tatra tatra kalyā�apāpakāna� kammāna� vipāka� pa�isa�vedetī ti 雞和哆子, recurs in [[MN2]] at MN I
8,23 as a view that obstructs progress to liberation from dukkha, further specified to imply the assumption that this self is eternal.
232 A minor difference in sequence is that [[MA201]] at T I 767b7 describes Sāti’s dismay only after this exposition, whereas [[MN38]] at MN I 258, 今此識往生, 不更異 28 has the same before it. That the Buddha in reply to Sāti’s misunderstanding turns right away to the topic of dependent arising shows, as pointed out by Buddhadāsa
1979/1992: 25, that Sāti’s view was due to his lack of understanding pa�icca samuppāda.

[[MA201]] at T I 767b12 reads “truly said”,, apparently following a secondary meaning of bhūta as
“truth” in opposition to abhūta as “falsehood”. Another occurrence of the expression bhūtam ida�,
found in [[SN12.31]] at SN II 48,4, has its counterpart in “truth”,, in [[SA345]] at T II 95b17, which

with nutriment”, tad āhārasambhavan ti, found in [[MN38]] at MN I 260,8, the corresponding passage in

sion in order to broaden the scope of his exposition from consciousness to all five aggregates. [234] In both versions this catechism culminates in warning the monks that they
should not grasp or cling to their own view, reminding them of the simile of the raft. [235]
In the Madhyama-āgama version, the Buddha at this point also asks the monks how
they would answer if they were to be questioned by an outsider on the purpose and
benefit of their view. The monks reply that the purpose of their view is disenchantment
and dispassion. [236]
Both versions next turn to the four types of nutriment and trace their conditioned
arising from craving all the way back to ignorance, followed by tracking the same dependent sequence forwards from ignorance up to old age and death. The Pāli version
concludes this examination with a summary statement on specific conditionality (“when
this exists, that exists; with the arising of this, that arises”), [237] a statement not found in
the Madhyama-āgama version. Both versions follow with the same catechism on the
cessation aspect of dependent arising, again with the difference that the Madhyamaāgama version does not have a summary statement on specific conditionality in the
cessation mode.
The Mahāta�hāsa�khaya-sutta and its parallel continue by reporting the monks’ affirmation that they were aloof from speculations about the self in relation to past, future, and present times. [238] According to both versions, the monks also declared that
they did not speak like this out of respect for their teacher, but out of personal knowledge, [239] proclaiming that it was out of the question for them to change teacher, or to be
concerned with auspicious signs and similar externals held in esteem among other recluses and Brahmins.
The Madhyama-āgama account reports that the monks made several additional assertions, such as that they would be incapable of committing any of the five heinous crimes,
or would never go so far as to forsake their precepts and give up their practice of the
path. [240] Although the details differ, the basic point made in both versions is the same, in


mistaking of “nutriment”, āhāra, for “worthy”, araha, which the translator then took to refer to the Tathāgata.

that the monks were endowed with the personal knowledge of a disciple in higher
training (sekha).
The two versions next turn to the three conditions for the conception of a foetus. The
same topic recurs as a discourse on its own in the Ekottarika-āgama. [241] While the Madhyama-āgama version simply enumerates the three conditions, [242] the Majjhima-nikāya
discourse also mentions the possibility that the mother is not in season or that the being
to be reborn is not present, both of which would prevent conception from taking place. [243]
The Ekottarika-āgama version takes up the different possibilities that could prevent
conception in more detail, listing various possible afflictions of the mother or the father. [244]

242 [[MA201]] at T I 769b23. [[MN93]] at MN II 157,1 also merely enumerates the three conditions. A discourse
quotation (not specific to the present discourse) in Abhidh-k 3:12 in Pradhan 1967: 121,22 parallels the
reference to the three conditions for conceptions in [[MN38]] at MN I 265,35; cf. also T 1558 at T XXIX
44c26, T 1559 at T XXIX 201c22, and D (4094) mngon pa, ju 110a3 or Q (5595) tu 126a1. Versions of
this discourse quotation can also be found in Dharmaskandha fragment 4737 folio 6r1 in Dietz 1984:
34,3 and in its Chinese counterpart T 1537 at T XXVI 507c8, as well as in the *Mahāvibhā�ā, T 1545
at T XXVII 309a12 or 356c27. The same three conditions recur also in the Divyāvadāna in Cowell 1886:
1,14 and 440,12 or Vaidya 1999: 1,9 and 286,11, in the Pravrajyāvastu of the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya in Dutt 1984d: 25,11 and fragment folio 6v10 in Vogel 1992: 81, and in the Yogācārabhūmi,
Bhattacharya 1957: 21,17 and T 1579 at T XXX 282b25; cf. also Hara 2009: 220-221. A complementary perspective on the ghabbassāvakkanti can be found in [[AN3.61]].9 at AN I 176,30.
243 [[MN38]] at MN I 265,37 refers to this being to be reborn as a gandhabba. [[DN15]] at DN II 63,2 refers to
the same in terms of the “consciousness”, viññā�a, that descends into the mother’s womb. According to
Böhtlingk 1883/1998b: 150, one of the meanings of the term gandharva is the soul after death, before it
enters a new body (“die Seele nach dem Tode, bevor sie in einen neuen Körper einzieht”). MW: 346
s.v. gandharva similarly speaks of “the soul after death and previous to its being born again”. The implications of this term are reflected in the Chinese translations: [[MA201]] at T I 769b24 reads, corresponding to gandhabba, and has “birth aggregate”,, as a, and variant reading. [[EA21.3]]
at T II 602c19+20 speaks of the “external consciousness”,, and then of the “consciousness that
wishes [to be reborn]”, . On the gandhabba or gandharva cf. also Anālayo 2008c, Blum 2004:
204, Harvey 1995a: 105-108, Hoffman 1987/1992: 67-69, Karunaratne 2003b: 132-133, Langer 2000:

“foetus”), Premasiri 2005a: 525, Przyluski 1938: 45, Somaratne 2005: 176-177, Upadhyaya 1971: 374375, Wayman 1974: 231-234, Wijesekera 1994: 175-212, and Windisch 1908: 14-27. Another shade of
meaning of the term can be seen in [[UD5.5]] at [[UD54.16]] which includes gandhabbas in a list of beings
that inhabit the ocean. Hecker 1972: 198 notes that the gandhabbas as celestial musicians are the type 香陰
of celestial beings most closely similar in nature to humans and may for this reason have been chosen 生陰 宋, 元 明
as pars pro toto to represent a being to be reborn. Oberlies 2005: 外識 98 explains that in Vedic literature “the
function of the Gandharv 欲識 _á_ is ... to escort things from ‘outside’ into this world”, adding that “seemingly
the Gandharv _á_ was identified now and then with the item he is guarding”. Ibid (p. 108) then suggests
that its function in the context of the early Buddhist listing of three conditions required for conception
could similarly be that of escorting the viññā�a from one existence to the next, a role which would, in
analogy to its Vedic predecessor, also allow for an identification of the gandhabba with the viññā�[[AN244]] [[EA21.3]] at T II 603a13 then concludes by instructing the monks to train themselves in order to elimi

Chapter 4 Mahāyamaka-vagga                                  -  255


The Mahāta�hāsa�khaya-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel report how, after MN I 266
successful conception, [245] following the period of the mother’s pregnancy a child is born,
grows up, and develops a liking for pleasant experiences and a dislike for unpleasant
ones. [246] The grown-up thereby delights in feeling, which in turn leads to the remaining
links of dependent arising. [247] In both versions, the present passage thus forms a practical
application of the previous treatment of dependent arising by way of its twelve links in
forward and backward order, illustrating how delight in feeling leads to clinging and
therewith to the conditioned arising of dukkha.
The two versions next take up the arising of a Tathāgata, which the Majjhima-nikāya
discourse treats in detail by giving a full account of the gradual path of training. [248] Its
Madhyama-āgama parallel does not have such a full account of the gradual path of
training. Instead, it only briefly notes that a Tathāgata arises in the world, after which it
straightaway turns to detachment in relation to feelings, thereby providing a contrast to
the child described earlier. [249] The Majjhima-nikāya version has a similar statement at
the end of its detailed exposition of the gradual path of training.
A problem with this part of the Majjhima-nikāya version is that it refers to the need
to stay aloof from likes and dislikes in regard to sensory experience twice. The first instance occurs as part of the gradual path under the heading of sense-restraint, the second is part of the final passage found in both versions on being unattached in regard to
whatever feelings arise at any sense-door. [250]
As a result of this repeated treatment, the Mahāta�hāsa�khaya-sutta turns to mindfulness of the body and aloofness from likes and dislikes only after the attainment of
the four jhānas. This way of presentation goes against the usual sequence of practice
depicted in the Nikāyas and Āgamas, where mindfulness of the body and aloofness
from sensory attraction are preconditions for developing the jhānas.


nate these three conditions,, which perhaps intends that they should
practise until they transcend future rebirth.
245 For a treatment of the development of a foetus, once conception has occurred, in the Garbhāvākrānti _-_
sūtra cf. Kritzer 2008, for the same in K�emendra’s Garbhāvakrāntyavadāna cf. Hahn 1997.
246 Both versions describe that the child is without mindfulness in regard to the body and with a narrow
state of mind, cf. [[MN38]] at MN I 266,24: anupa��hitakāyasati ca viharati parittacetaso and [[MA201]] at
T I 769b29: . Regarding the children games described in [[MN38]] at MN I 266,14 cf. the
study of various such games in Ramers 1996: 183-200.
247 According to [[MA201]] at T I 769c10, at this point the Buddha also explained that Sāti was under the influence of craving, a point made in [[MN38]] at MN I 271,1 towards the end of the discourse.
248 [[MN38]] at MN I 267,13. 斷三因緣如是, 諸比丘, 當作是學
249 The subject of the description of detachment in regard to feelings in [[MA201]] at T I 769c14 is “he”, .
Judging from the corresponding passage in [[MN38]] at MN I 270,9, the subject should be a disciple in
general, not the Tathāgata. In fact, the point made in both versions is to depict the path to freedom from
likes and dislikes and therewith to freedom from the dependent arising of dukkha. To exemplify this,
the example of a disciple who undertakes the gradual path would be a more straightforward illustration.
250 [[MN38]] at MN I 269, 不立身念少心 2 and at MN I 270,9. The two instances are, however, not identical, as in the first
case the description is part of a process of training, whereas in the second case the context suggests
some degree of accomplishment.
彼

It could also be questioned how far a full account of the gradual path of training fits
the present context, since in other discourses such an account is usually given to newcomers or outsiders, or else when the context requires such a detailed treatment. The
present discourse’s main concern, however, is dependent arising, which would not require a full account of the gradual path of training. The audience of the Buddha in this
particular instance are monks who are already disciples in higher training. Thus the
members of his audience would have been well acquainted with the gradual path of
training from their own experience and would therefore not need to be given a detailed
account of it. [251] These points would support the presentation in the Madhyama-āgama
version, which does not have a full account of the gradual path.
The Majjhima-nikāya discourse concludes with the monks rejoicing, to which the
Madhyama-āgama version adds a triple shaking of numerous world systems. [252]


[[MN39]] Mahā-assapura

The Mahā-assapura-sutta, the “greater discourse at Assapura”, explains what makes
a monk a true “recluse”. This discourse has two Chinese parallels, found in the Madhyama-āgama and in the Ekottarika-āgama. [253] A few lines of this discourse have also
been preserved in Sanskrit fragments. [254]

MN I 271   The three parallel versions agree in listing the qualities that make monks true recluses, although with some differences (see table 4.10). The Mahā-assapura-sutta begins by stipulating a sense of shame and fear of wrongdoing, [255] a quality not mentioned
in its parallels. [256] The Majjhima-nikāya version continues by highlighting the need to


251 Manné 1995: 16 notes that especially in the Sīlakkhandha-vagga of the Dīgha-nikāya a full treatment
of the gradual path often functions as a “coup de grâce ... in the Buddha’s answer to the challenges
made by his opponents”, a role that supports the impression that a full account of the gradual path is
usually part of a discourse given to outsiders or new converts, not to disciples in higher training.
252 [[MA201]] at T I 769c28 speaks of a “a triple shaking of the three-thousand great thousand[-fold] world
elements”, .
253 The parallels are [[MA182]] at T I 724c-725c and [[EA49.8]] at T II 801c-802b. [[MA182]] and [[EA49.8]] agree
with [[MN39]] on the location where the discourse was spoken. [[MA182]] has the title “discourse at Horse
City”,, and thus agrees with [[MN39]] although without qualifying this discourse to be a “greater”
one. A counterpart to the first section of [[MN39]] can be found in a discourse quotation in the Chinese
Udāna collection, T 212 at T IV 681a22. Skilling 1997a: 339 notes a reference to a version of the present discourse by the title dge sbyong, “recluse”, found in an uddāna preserved in Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya at D (4094) mngon pa, ju 235b4 or Q (5595) tu 269a4.
254 SHT I 562 (p. 250, identified in Schlingloff 1967: 422; cf. also SHT VIII p. 176), and SHT VI 1392 (p.
113; cf. also SHT VIII p. 204). SHT I 562 parallels the assumption that nothing more needs to be done,
found at MN I 271, 三千大千世界三反震動 26; SHT VI 1392 parallels the instruction to purify mental conduct at MN I 272,20;
SHT I 562 and SHT VI 1392 also parallel part of the description of sense-restraint at MN I 273,3. For a
discourse quotation in Abhidh-k-� cf. below note 274.
255 [[MN39]] at MN I 271, 馬邑經 22: hirottappena samannāgatā bhavissāmā ti.
256 Another difference is that while in [[MN39]] at MN I 271,13 and [[MA182]] at T I 724c23 the Buddha approaches this topic directly by telling the monks how their claim to being a recluse will not be in vain


Chapter 4 _Mahàyamaka-vagga_                                     - 257


develop pure physical, verbal, and mental conduct, as well as pure livelihood. These
four qualities recur also in the _Madhyama-àgama_ parallel. [257] The next quality in the
Pàli version is the need to develop restraint of the sense-doors, [258] a need also taken into
account in the Chinese versions.

The _Mahà-assapura-sutta_ continues by turning to moderation with food. [259] The same
quality recurs only in the _Ekottarika-àgama_ version, which compares food to grease,
used to treat a sore or to smear the axle of a chariot. [260] The same image recurs in discourses in the _Saüyutta-nikàya_ and the Chinese _Dãrgha-àgama_ to illustrate moderation
with food. [261] The _Mahà-assapura-sutta_ next takes up the development of wakefulness, [262]
a quality found only in its _Ekottarika-àgama_ parallel. The _Ekottarika-àgama_ version's

two types of recluse, the “practising recluse”, 習行沙門, and the “confirmed recluse”, 誓願沙門 (I follow the indication by Hirakawa 1997: 1077 that 誓願 can render _pratij¤à_, which seems to fit the present case, as this recluse represents an arahant), after which ânanda requests that the Buddha gives
further explanations.

description of wakefulness resembles the Majjhima-nikāya instructions, in addition to
which it also speaks of giving attention to the thirty-seven requisites to awakening (bodhipakkhiyā dhammā) by day and by night. [263]
In relation to this difference, it could be noted that, although the various mental qualities and activities subsumed under the heading of ‘thirty-seven requisites to awakening’
occur frequently in the discourses, the heading itself appears to belong to a later period. [264]

MN I 274   After describing the development of wakefulness, the Majjhima-nikāya version turns
to the practice of clear comprehension of activities. [265] This practice recurs also in the
Madhyama-āgama parallel, but is absent from the Ekottarika-āgama account. [266] The
Majjhima-nikāya and Madhyama-āgama versions also agree that the next thing to be
done is to retreat into seclusion, followed by overcoming the five hindrances and attaining the four jhānas, a progress of practice not taken into account in the Ekottarikaāgama version. The Pāli discourse offers a set of illustrative similes for each hindrance
and for each of the jhānas, similes not found in the Chinese parallels. [267]
In regard to the considerable difference between the Ekottarika-āgama presentation
and the other two versions, it is noteworthy that even though this discourse occurs
among the elevens of the Ekottarika-āgama, it presents only four qualities that make
up a true recluse. This gives the impression that its presentation could be due to a loss
of seven qualities from an earlier list of eleven qualities. [268]

266 [[MA182]] at T I 725b8: .
267 [[MN39]] at MN I 275,8. Both sets of similes recur as part of the standard expositions of the gradual path
in nearly every discourse of the Sīlakkhandha-vagga of the Dīgha-nikāya: [[DN2]] at DN I 71,30, [[DN3]] at
DN I 100,6, [[DN4]] at DN I 124,24, [[DN5]] at DN I 147,8, [[DN6]] at DN I 157,21, [[DN7]] at DN I 159,16, [[DN8]] at DN I 172,26, [[DN9]] at DN I 182,12, [[DN10]] at DN I 207,15, [[DN11]] at DN I 214,23, [[DN12]] at DN I
232,13, and [[DN13]] at DN I 250,29 (all occurrences abbreviated except for [[DN2]]). While the similes for
the jhānas recur also in [[MN77]] at MN II 15,11 and [[MN119]] at MN III 92,28, the similes for the hindrances are not found elsewhere in the 思惟三十七道之法 Majjhima-nikāya. Yit 2004b: 262 note 461 highlights that [[MN39]] refers to not incurring a loss of wealth not only in relation to being released from prison (MN I
275,27), but also in relation to crossing a desert (MN I 276,5). The corresponding set of similes in [[DN2]]
at DN I 72,17, however, only mentions loss of wealth in the case of the first of these two similes. The 當學正知出入, 善觀分別
set of similes for the hindrances has a counterpart in [[DA20]] at T I 85a25, although occurring in a different sequence, which proceeds from release from servitude (4 [th] in [[MN39]]), via repayment of a loan
(1 [st] in [[MN39]]), recovery from disease (2 [nd] in [[MN39]]), release from prison (3 [rd] in [[MN39]]), to safely
crossing a desert with wealth (5 [th] in [[MN39]]). Another occurrence can be found in T 21 at T I 265c17,
which lists repayment of a loan (1 [st] in [[MN39]]), release from slavery (4 [th] in [[MN39]]), release from prison
(3 [rd] in [[MN39]]), recovery from disease (2 [nd] in [[MN39]]), and safely travelling an evil path with wealth (5 [th]
in [[MN39]]). The same [[DA20]] at T I 85b14 continues with the four jhāna similes, similes also found in
[[MA81]] at T I 555b20 and [[MA98]] at T I 582c22. For a more detailed examination of the jhāna similes
cf. below p. 674.
268 Judging from the overall dynamics, these seven missing qualities might have covered the development
of fourfold purity by way of body, speech, mind, and livelihood, the practice of clear comprehension of
activities, the removal of the five hindrances, and the development of the four jhānas. Although this re

Chapter 4 Mahāyamaka-vagga -  259



The Pāli version continues at this point with recollection of past lives and the ability MN I 278
to directly perceive the passing away and reappearing of beings according to their deeds,
two higher knowledges not mentioned in its two Chinese parallels. [269] The three versions agree, however, on insight into the four noble truths and the destruction of the influxes as the culmination point of the practice. [270]
In relation to this difference, it would seem that, since the two higher knowledges are
not required for the destruction of the influxes, they may also not be absolutely necessary for becoming a true recluse. Other Pāli discourses similarly proceed directly from
the four jhānas to the destruction of the influxes, without bringing in the other two
higher knowledges. [271] In the end, it is the third of these higher knowledges that, according to all versions of the present discourse, definitely turns a monk into a true recluse.
The Mahā-assapura-sutta employs the image of a mountain lake to illustrate the MN I 279
destruction of the influxes, a simile not found in the two parallel versions. [272] In its stead,
the Ekottarika-āgama version presents a stanza spoken by the Buddha, according to
which one becomes a recluse by eradicating evil and a pure Brahmin by leaving behind
all delusion. [273]
The three versions conclude by giving a deeper meaning to terms like “recluse” and MN I 280
“Brahmin”, explaining them to stand for qualities of a fully awakened one. [274]

mains entirely hypothetical, at least the practice of clear comprehension of bodily activities is not totally absent from [[EA49.8]] since its initial exposition of the two types of recluse at T II 801c21 characterizes the “practising recluse” as one who undertakes bodily activities – such as going and coming,
looking up and down, wearing robes and bowl – in accordance with the Dharma, a description similar
to the standard expositions of clear comprehension of activities, cf., e.g., [[MN10]] at MN I 57,5 and its

[[MN40]] Cū�a-assapura-sutta

The Cū�a-assapura-sutta, the “lesser discourse at Assapura”, explains that to be a
true recluse does not depend on outer observances, but requires purification of the
mind. This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama. [275]

MN I 281   The Cū�a-assapura-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel open with the Buddha
exhorting the monks that they should train themselves in such a way that their claim to
being a recluse will not be in vain and offerings given to them will be fruitful. Both
versions compare the presence of defiled states of mind in a recluse to a sharp weapon
wrapped in a robe. [276] The two discourses explain that someone who has not overcome
mental defilements falls short of being a recluse, even if he should be wearing robes, or
observe nudity, have matted hair, not sit down, or undertake (presumably ritual) bathing. [277]
According to the Cū�a-assapura-sutta, the Buddha wittily pointed out that if such
observances were in themselves productive of mental purity, one’s friends and relatives
would make one undertake them right after birth. [278] The Madhyama-āgama version
similarly describes how one’s friends and relatives would try to make one undertake
such observances, without, however, specifying that they would do so right after one’s
birth. [279] Without this specification, however, the illustration loses some of its force.

MN I 283   The Cū�a-assapura-sutta and its parallel agree that the proper way to true recluseship is to overcome defiled states of mind. The Majjhima-nikāya version stands alone
in describing how joy arises in a monk once his mind is free from defilements, a joy


27b2 or Q (5595) thu 63b1, which provides definitions for the terms “recluse”, dge sbyong, “Brahmin”,
bram ze, “noble one”, ’phags pa, and “one who has been washed”, khrus byed pa ba; cf. Abhidh-k 6:51
in Pradhan 1967: 369,9, which parallels the definition of a recluse in [[MN39]] at MN I 280,12; cf. also T
1558 at T XXIX 128a14 and T 1559 at T XXIX 279b15. Norman 1991/1993c: 276 and 278 draws attention to the historical background to the Buddhist use of the terms nahātaka and vedagū. He explains that
“in its brahmanical sense snātaka is used of a brahman who has carried out the ceremonial bathing at
the end of the brahma-cārin stage of his life. The Buddha rejected the efficacy of ritual bathing, and
used the term metaphorically [in the sense] of washing away evil by means of the eightfold path”. “The
word vedagu, which in its brahmanical sense meant one who had gained competence in the Vedas, was
interpreted as one who had gained knowledge of release from sa�sāra”.
275 The parallel is [[MA183]] at T I 725c-726c, which agrees with the Pāli version on the location where the
discourse was given and on its title (“discourse at Horse City”, ), although without qualifying
this discourse as a “lesser” one. Just as in the case of [[MN39]] a reference to a version of [[MN40]] by the
title dge sbyong, “recluse”, can be found in an uddāna in Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya at D (4094) mngon pa, ju 235b4 or Q (5595) tu 269a4 (noted by Skilling 1997a: 339).

can be found in the Jain Isibhāsiyāi� 45.45 in Schubring 1969: 551.
277 Bronkhorst 1998b: 84 notes that some of these are practices of Brahmin ascetics, even though the topic
of the passage is the sama�a. Shiraishi 1996: 198 explains that, judging from “the records of ascetics
found in the Buddhist canon”, “the difference between the vānaprastha and the parivrājaka might not
have been so distinct”.

which in turn leads to tranquillity and concentration. [280] In its place, the Madhyamaāgama version speaks of overcoming the five hindrances, based on having developed
pure bodily, verbal, and mental conduct. [281]
Both versions next turn to the development of the four brahmavihāras as a boundless
radiation in all directions. The Madhyama-āgama version follows this with a reflection
aimed at the development of insight, [282] whereby the influxes will be destroyed and full
liberation will be achieved. This reflection is not found in the Cū�a-assapura-sutta.
According to both discourses, the Buddha delivered the simile of a delightful pond in
which a thirsty and tired man can quench his thirst and take a bath, no matter from
which of the four directions he approaches the pond. [283] Similarly, regardless of which
of the four social classes a man may belong to, if he goes forth, develops the brahmavihāras, and achieves tranquillity of the mind, he becomes a true recluse.
The Pāli version introduces a finer distinction at this point, since it reckons one who
has gone forth and achieved tranquillity of the mind as one who practises the proper
way of a true recluse, [284] but once the influxes are destroyed, such a one is a true recluse. [285] This distinction is not found in the Chinese version. The Pāli version thus explicitly reckons the achievement of internal tranquillity through developing the brahmavihāras as the proper way to true recluse-ship. In this way the brahmavihāras, although not yet constituting the consummation of recluse-ship, figure in the Pāli version
more explicitly as an important factor leading up to the final goal.
While the Cū�a-assapura-sutta concludes at this point, the Madhyama-āgama discourse continues by defining the four terms “recluse”, “Brahmin”, “noble one” and
“one purified through bathing”, similar to the final part of the Madhyama-āgama parallel to the Mahā-assapura-sutta. [286]

## Chapter 5 Cū�ayamaka-vagga

[[MN41]] Sāleyyaka-sutta & [[MN42]] Verañjaka-sutta

The Sāleyyaka-sutta, the “discourse to those from Sālā”, and the Verañjaka-sutta, the
“discourse to those from Verañjā”, are two versions of the same discourse, addressed
to the Brahmins of Sālā and Verañjā respectively. These two discourses have their
counterpart in two consecutive discourses in the Sa�yukta-āgama. [1]
A minor difference between the Pāli and Chinese versions is that the Sāleyyaka-sutta and the Verañjaka-sutta begin by describing in detail the favourable report about the
recluse Gotama heard by the Brahmins of Sālā or by the Brahmins of Verañjā that motivated them to visit the Buddha, while the Chinese versions simply mention that the
Brahmins had come to know about the Buddha’s presence and so went to pay him a
visit.
The Pāli versions also report that on coming into the Buddha’s presence some Brahmins expressed more respect than others, while some silently sat down at one side. [2] The
Chinese versions do not mention such differences.
The four discourses agree that the Brahmins asked the Buddha what causes rebirth in
hell and in heaven. The Buddha replied that conduct not in accordance with the Dharma results in rebirth in hell, whereas conduct in accordance with the Dharma leads to a
heavenly rebirth. [3] On being requested by the Brahmins to explain both types of conduct, [4] the Buddha expounded the ten unwholesome courses of actions and their ten
wholesome counterparts.


1 The parallels are [[SA1042]] and [[SA1043]] at T II 272c-273b. Both are located in the country of Kosala,
thereby agreeing with [[MN41]] on the location, while [[MN42]] takes place in Jeta’s Grove by Sāvatthī.
Akanuma 1929/1990: 93 employs the location of the discourse,, as a tentative title for [[SA1042]]
and [[SA1043]] A translation of [[SA1042]] together with extracts from the present study, can be found in
Anālayo 2006g.
2 [[MN41]] at MN I 285,18 and [[MN42]] at MN I 290,29. The Brahmins from Verañjā as a group do not seem
to take part in any other discourse in the Pāli Nikāyas, although a single Brahmin from Verañjā occurs in
[[AN8.11]] at AN IV 172,17 (= Vin III 1,7). The Brahmins from Sālā recur in [[MN60]] at MN I 400,29, according to which the Buddha delivered a detailed examination of various types of view to them. Although
[[MN60]] does not stand in an explicit temporal relation to [[MN41]] the relatively more basic exposition
given to these Brahmins in [[MN41]] gives the impression as if the present discourse could be reporting the
earlier of these two meetings between the Brahmins from Sālā and the Buddha.
3 A difference is that while in [[MN41]] at MN I 285,26 and [[MN42]] at MN I 291, 鞞聞摩 6 the Brahmins present their
inquiry about rebirth in hell and heaven as a single question, in [[SA1042]] at T II 272c22+29 and [[SA1043]]
at T II 273b6 (where the second question is abbreviated) they first ask about rebirth in hell. After having
received a reply to their inquiry about rebirth in hell, they ask about rebirth in heaven.
4 A minor difference is that while according to [[MN41]] at MN I 286,1 and [[MN42]] at MN I 291,16 the Brahmins indicate that they have been unable to grasp in detail what the Buddha had stated in brief, so that it
would be good if the Buddha were to elaborate, according to [[SA1042]] at T II 272c25 and T II 273a3 they
simply ask him to explain the two types of conduct (in [[SA1043]] this passage is abbreviated).



MN I 285


264   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


MN I 286   The Pāli versions stand alone in introducing this exposition of the ten unwholesome
courses of action by distinguishing them into three bodily, four verbal, and three mental types of conduct. [5]
Another difference is that the Chinese versions simply enumerate the ten unwholesome courses of action, whereas the Pāli versions offer a detailed exposition of each of
the ten course of action (see table 5.1). [6] When evaluating this difference, it seems that
such a detailed exposition of the ten courses of action would fit the present context well.
Since the Brahmins were requesting practical instructions about the path to heaven and
hell, it would have been opportune to explain to them in detail what the ten courses of
action refer to.

MN I 289   The Pāli and Chinese versions agree in indicating that someone who observes such
conduct in accordance with the Dharma may expect his aspiration to rebirth in a good
family or in one of the various heavenly realms to be fulfilled. The Pāli versions apply
this prospective not only to rebirth in good families and rebirth in celestial realms of
the sense-sphere, but also to:

      - rebirth in the Brahmā realms, [ 7]

5 [[MN41]] at MN I 286,10.
6 This detailed treatment recurs in [[MN114]] at MN III 46,24 and in [[AN10.176]] at AN V 264,12. While [[MN114]] does not appear to have a Chinese counterpart, the parallel to [[AN10.176]] [[SA1039]] at T II 271b20,
offers a similar detailed exposition of the ten courses of action. On the expression mālāgu�aparikkhitta
(B [e] -MN I 355,21 and S [e] -MN I 521,10: mālāgu�aparikkhitta), found in the description of the third type of
bodily misconduct in [[MN41]] at MN I 286,21, cf. Silk 2007a: 7.
7 A noteworthy aspect of this exposition is that, while proceeding through the Brahmā realms, [[MN41]] at
MN I 289,17 (this part is abbreviated in [[MN42]]) at first refers to Brahmā’s retinue, the brahmakāyika


Chapter 5 Cū�ayamaka-vagga                                   -  265


 - rebirth in the Pure Abodes,

 - rebirth in the immaterial realms,

 - the destruction of the influxes.
The Chinese versions work through a similar range of possible rebirths, although
they differ in as much as they give additional details on what is required for each kind
of rebirth. While they agree with the Pāli versions that rebirth in good families requires
conduct in accordance with the Dharma, for rebirth in the different celestial realms of
the sense-sphere they additionally speak of practising pure morality. [8] Although pure
morality is to some extent already implicit in the stipulation to observe conduct in accordance with the Dharma, this additional qualification highlights that a celestial rebirth requires higher ethical standards than rebirth in a human family of good standing.
For rebirth in the Brahmā realms, the Chinese versions stipulate conduct in accordance with the Dharma, pure morality, and freedom from sensual desires. [9] This additional stipulation regarding freedom from sensual desires goes beyond the absence of
covetousness mentioned as part of the ten wholesome courses of action and thus highlights the qualitative difference between rebirth in the celestial realms of the sensesphere and rebirth in the Brahmā realms. [10]


devas; then refers to the realm corresponding to the second jhāna under a single title, the ābhā devas;
then lists three sub-realms corresponding to the second jhāna, the parittābhā, appamā�ābhā, and ābhassara devas; then refers to the realm corresponding to the third jhāna under a single title, the subha devas;
again followed by listing the three corresponding sub-realms, the parittasubha, appamā�asubha, and subhaki��a devas (the subha devas are absent from the Burmese and Siamese editions of [[MN41]] and [[MN42]] B [e] -MN I 359,29 and B [e] -MN I 364,27 as well as S [e] -MN I 526,17 and S [e] -MN I 533,20; for an examination of the relationship of the realms of Buddhist cosmology to mental experiences cf. also, e.g., Gethin
1997a). Unfortunately, in the Chinese versions this whole part is abbreviated, making a comparison impossible. The same type of listing recurs in [[MN120]] at MN III 102,26+31 and in the Mahāvastu in Basak
1965: 471,5 or in Senart 1890: 348,19 (although without including the parīttaśubha devas, which are,
however, mentioned in another listing in the Mahāvastu in Basak 1965: 487,7 or in Senart 1890: 360,19).
The pattern found in [[MN41]] reminds of a tendency in Jain literature, described by Bruhn 1983: 59 as involving a “multiplication of segments in cosmography”, where the “emphasis is on series-cum-subseries
(subdivision as a form-element) rather than on long and coherent series”. Nattier 2009: 101 explains that
the “complex cosmological vision” reflected in Buddhist texts “was clearly not formulated all at once”;
whereas the sources reflect an “early standardization of the list of kāmadhātu heavens”,”the same cannot
be said of the heavens belonging to the rūpadhātu” (p. 105); cf. also Masson 1942: 22-26.
8 [[SA1042]] at T II 273a11: . In a similar vein, according to the Karmavibha�ga in Kudo 2004: 76,12
or in Lévi 1932a: 47,10, to undertake the ten wholesome courses of action “well [yet] weakly”, subhāvitā
mandabhāvitāś ca, is the condition for rebirth as a human, whereas rebirth in a sensual heavenly world
requires having undertaken the same ten courses of action in a way that is “well completed”, susamāptā,
a difference that also highlights the higher ethical standards required for such rebirth. The Śrāvakabhūmi
also stipulates purified moral conduct for rebirth in the heavenly spheres of the sensual realm, cf. Shukla
1973: 62,12 or ŚSG 1998: 96,19 and T 1579 at T XXX 406a27.
9 [[SA1042]] at T II 273a13: “keeping morality fully pure and separating the mind from craving and sensual
desire”, .
10 In a similar vein, [[DN33]] at DN III 260,1 and [[AN8.35]] at AN IV 241,7 indicate that for rebirth in the Brahmā world, morality (sīla 行淨戒 ) and freedom from sensuality (vītarāga) are required, as does the Śrāvakabhū持戒清淨, 心離愛欲


266   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


Having described rebirth in the Brahmā realms up to the highest realm of the Pure
Abodes, the Chinese versions indicate that the same conditions (namely conduct in accordance with the Dharma, moral purity, and freedom from sensual desires) also serve
as conditions for attaining the four jhānas in one’s present life. In this way, according
to their presentation the Buddha led the discussion from the otherworldly benefits,
about which his Brahmin visitors had inquired, to the benefits that can be achieved in
the present life.
The Chinese versions continue by indicating that the same conditions also serve as a
basis for developing:

      - the four brahmavihāras,

      - the four immaterial attainments,

      - the three lower stages of awakening,

      - supernormal powers,

      - the divine ear,

      - telepathic knowledge,

      - recollection of past lives,

      - the divine eye,

      - the destruction of the influxes.
Only the last of these, the destruction of the influxes, is mentioned in the Pāli versions.

MN I 290   The Pāli versions conclude with the Brahmins taking refuge and declaring themselves to be lay followers for life. The Chinese versions, however, report only that the
Brahmins rejoiced in the Buddha’s exposition, not that they became lay followers.
Looking back on the Sāleyyaka-sutta and the Verañjaka-sutta, these two discourses
are so similar that the question could be asked if they go back to a single original. That
is, was the same discourse delivered twice, or was it delivered only once and some
confusion about the name of its auditors led to a doubling of the discourse?
The differences between these two, as well as the differences between their Chinese
parallels, are of a rather minor nature. While the two Pāli versions are situated in different places, the two Chinese versions even share the same location. Except for the
names of the Brahmins, the two Pāli versions differ from each other only in that one of
them mentions the number of monks present, while the other does not record their number. [11] The two Chinese versions are also nearly identical, as they differ from each other


mi, cf. Shukla 1973: 62,16 or ŚSG 1998: 98,3 and T 1579 at T XXX 406a29. The Karmavibha�ga in Kudo 2004: 78,7 and 79,5 or in Lévi 1932a: 47,17 does not mention the need for freedom from sensuality
for rebirth in the Brahmā worlds, but only speaks of undertaking the ten courses of action to a degree
superior to the degree required for rebirth in a sensual heavenly world. The Dharmaskandha, fragment
4737 folio 14r9 in Dietz 1984: 62,20 and T 1537 at T XXVI 512c22, also stipulates the need for absorption attainment.
11 [[MN41]] at MN I 285,2: mahatā bhikkhusa�ghena saddhi�, a specification not made in [[MN42]] Another
minor difference is a matter of formulation, where the introductory part of the exposition of the ten
types of action in [[MN41]] at MN I 286,10 reads adhammacariyā visamacariyā hoti, while the corre

Chapter 5 Cū�ayamaka-vagga                                   -  267


only in the way they describe how the Brahmins (which also have different names)
came to the Buddha’s presence. [12]
A relatively clear instance of a doubling of discourses can be found in the Madhyama-āgama, which has preserved two parallels to the Vanapattha-sutta. [13] These two
Madhyama-āgama discourses are so similar to each other that they do seem to go back
to what originally was only a single discourse, an impression confirmed by the fact that
they have only a single Pāli counterpart.
Another instance of doubling of discourses can be found in the Sa�yutta-nikāya,
which records two instances in which Ānanda received instructions on mindfulness of
breathing. [14] These two discourses are identical in content and differ only on whether
the Buddha gave these instructions after an inquiry by Ānanda or without his prompting. Of these two discourses, only the one in which Ānanda inquired about the subject
of mindfulness of breathing has a counterpart in the Sa�yukta-āgama. [15]
Since according to the traditional account Ānanda had such mental retention that he
had memorized all the discourses spoken by the Buddha, [16] it seems improbable that he
would be depicted as needing to be given the same instruction again, or else that the
Buddha would have forgotten that he had already taught Ānanda on this subject.
That is, the more probable account appears to be given in the Sa�yukta-āgama version, according to which Ānanda received this particular instruction only once. If this


sponding part in [[MN42]] at MN I 291,25 reads adhammacārī visamacārī hoti, i.e., [[MN41]] speaks of
“conduct”, while [[MN42]] of “one who undertakes conduct”.
12 [[SA1042]] at T II 272c21 simply mentions that the Brahmins approached the place where the Buddha was
staying, whereas [[SA1043]] at T II 273b2 describes how they travelled by vehicle until they reached the
vicinity of the Buddha’s place of residence, where they got down and proceeded on foot. This passage

268   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


should indeed be the original version, then the two discourses in the Sa�yutta-nikāya
would be a doubling of what should be considered a single instance.
Another such case can be found in the A�guttara-nikāya, where Ānanda on two occasions inquired after the significance of “becoming” (bhava), and the Buddha replied by
delivering two nearly identical discourses. [17] Here, too, once Ānanda had received a reply to such an inquiry, there would have been no need for him to ask the same question
a second time, so that that these two discourses might also go back to a single occasion.
In the case of the Sāleyyaka-sutta and the Verañjaka-sutta, however, the Sa�yuktaāgama agrees in presenting this exposition by the Buddha in a pair-wise fashion. Hence
the evidence that can be gathered through a comparative study would rather suggest
that the Sāleyyaka-sutta and the Verañjaka-sutta, as well as their two Chinese parallels,
might go back to two individual occasions. After all, an exposition of the ways leading
to heaven and hell must have been a topic of such common interest in ancient India that
it would not be extraordinary for different Brahmins to pose the same question to a religious teacher like the Buddha. [18]


[[MN43]] Mahāvedalla-sutta

The Mahāvedalla-sutta, the “greater discourse of the question-and-answer type”, records a discussion on various topics between Mahāko��hita and Sāriputta. This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama. [19] Several sections of this discourse have
also been preserved as discourse quotations in Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya, extant in Tibetan. [20]

MN I 292   The Mahāvedalla-sutta begins by describing that Mahāko��hita visited Sāriputta and
asked him a series of questions. The Tibetan version agrees with the Pāli account in this
respect, [21] whereas according to the Madhyama-āgama version it was rather Sāriputta
who asked questions of Mahāko��hita. [22] The Mahāvedalla-sutta and its Madhyama-āga

17 [[AN3.76-77]] at AN I 223-224, which differ from each other in that [[AN3.76]] at AN I 223,23 reads viññā�a� pati��hita�, whereas [[AN3.77]] at AN I 224,17 reads cetanā pati��hitā patthanā pati��hitā.
18 Cf., e.g., [[AN4.3]] at AN I 56,16, which reports that the Brahmin Jā�usso�i similarly inquired after the
causes for rebirth in hell or in heaven.
19 The parallel is [[MA211]] at T I 790b-792b and has the title “Mahāko��hita’s discourse”, ; cf.
also Abhidh-k-�, which similarly gives the title of the discourse as gsus po che’i mdo, “Mahāko��hita’s
discourse”, e.g., at D (4094) mngon pa, nyu 81a4 or Q (5595) thu 127a3. [[MA211]] has been studied and
translated by Minh Chau 1964/1991: 73, 104-105, 145-146, 205, and 258-268. While [[MN43]] takes place
at Jeta’s Grove by Sāvatthī, [[MA211]] has the Squirrels’ Feeding Ground by Rājagaha as its location.
Akanuma 1929/1990: 165 lists [[SA251]] at T II 60b-c as another parallel. Yet, similar to the discourses
[[SN22.127-132]] at SN III 172-174, [[SA251]] only reports that Mahāko��hita asked Sāriputta about the implications of ignorance and its opposite, not on a whole range of different topics as in [[MN43]] Thus [[SA251]] is not a parallel to [[MN43]]

ma parallel also differ on the subject matter of the ensuing discussion. Although both
versions record a similar number of questions, several of these questions differ in content (see below table 5.2). [23]


Table 5.2: Main Topics Examined in [[MN43]] and [[MA211]]

|[[MN43]]|[[MA211]]|

|wisdom (1)<br>consciousness (2)<br>feeling (3)<br>perception (4)<br>mind-consciousness (5)<br>right view (6)<br>becoming (7)<br>1st jhāna (8)<br>5 faculties (9)<br>cessation (10)<br>deliverance of the mind (11)|wholesome and unwholesome<br>wisdom (→ 1)<br>consciousness (→ 2)<br>right view (→ 6)<br>becoming (→ 7)<br>feeling (→ 3)<br>counterpart to cessation<br>5 faculties (→ 9)<br>cessation (→ 10)<br>deliverance of the mind (→ 11)<br> (≠ 4-5, 8)|



In regard to some of these questions, an exchange between the versions of the present
discourse and the versions of the Cū�avedalla-sutta appears to have taken place, since
some topics taken up in the Chinese parallel to the Cū�avedalla-sutta occur in the Pāli
Mahāvedalla-sutta, just as some topics treated in the Chinese parallel to the Mahāvedalla-sutta form part of the Pāli Cū�avedalla-sutta.
The two discourses also exchange places within the respective collections as well as
exchanging the geographical locations where they took place. Thus, while the Mahāvedalla-sutta precedes the Cū�avedalla-sutta in the Majjhima-nikāya, the Chinese parallel to the Mahāvedalla-sutta follows the Chinese parallel to the Cū�avedalla-sutta in
the Madhyama-āgama. While the Mahāvedalla-sutta takes place at Sāvatthī and the
Cū�avedalla-sutta takes place at Rājagaha, the Chinese parallel to the Mahāvedallasutta takes place at Rājagaha and the Chinese parallel to the Cū�avedalla-sutta takes
place at Sāvatthī. Perhaps due to the relatively similar nature of these two discourses,
an exchange of material between the two could easily happen during the process of
transmission.
The first topic taken up for discussion in the Mahāvedalla-sutta is wisdom. In agreement with its Madhyama-āgama parallel, the Mahāvedalla-sutta defines wisdom to be
insight into the four noble truths. [24] The Tibetan version, however, defines wisdom in


23 Minh Chau 1964/1991: 259 counts thirty-two questions in each version, out of which only seventeen are
common to both.
24 [[MA211]] at T I 790b16 precedes this with a question and answer exchange on the nature of what is wholesome and what is unwholesome. Two discourse quotation in Abhidh-k-� parallel the present section: D
(4094) mngon pa, nyu 95a3 or Q (5595) thu 143b8 parallels the discussion of the nature of wisdom and
consciousness, leading up to the definition of consciousness in [[MN43]] at MN I 292,25; cf. also Abhidh-k
9 in Lee 2005: 134,1 or Pradhan 1967: 473,23, with its Chinese counterparts in T 1558 at T XXIX 157b20


270   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


terms of knowing as it really is what is wholesome and what is unwholesome, as well
as knowing dependent arising as it really is. [25]
The Mahāvedalla-sutta next turns to the nature of consciousness. The Pāli discourse
defines consciousness as the act of cognising the three types of feeling, [26] while the Chinese account and the Tibetan version speak instead of cognising the six sense objects. [27]
Still another perspective on the same matter can be found in a discourse in the Sa�yutta-nikāya, which defines consciousness in terms of cognising different tastes, while
its parallel in the Sa�yukta-āgama defines consciousness in terms of cognising the objects of the six senses. [28] In each of these two instances, the Chinese and Tibetan versions are closer to the standard presentation of consciousness by way of the six sensebases, while the Pāli versions offer complementary perspectives on consciousness, defining its function with the help of different examples by way of feeling or taste.
The Mahāvedalla-sutta and its two parallels agree that wisdom and consciousness
are conjoined states, since to (wisely) know is to cognise. The Pāli version stands alone
in explaining that the difference between wisdom and consciousness is that wisdom
should be developed, while consciousness should be understood. [29]

MN I 293   The Mahāvedalla-sutta next inquires into the nature of feeling, explaining that feelings “feel”, [30] followed by listing the three types of feeling (pleasant, painful, and neutral). The same topic occurs at a later point in the Madhyama-āgama version, which,
however, does not explain that feelings “feel”. Instead, it introduces its listing of the
three types of feeling by inquiring how many feelings can be found, followed by indicating that the three feelings arise in dependence on contact. [31]

awareness of ... [what] is to be known (jñeyya�), and this contributes to the development of wisdom,
which is developed (bhāvita) and eventually culminates in liberating insight”. According to Kalupahana
1999: 39, “paññā is ... the perception of the objective world with wisdom, while viññā�a is simply the
ordinary awareness of the same objective world”. Premasiri 2004: 294 explains that “what is cognized
in the way of paññā is the same as what is cognized in the way of viññā�a”, “the difference pertains to
the way the objective existence is cognized”, to which Premasiri 1987: 63 adds that “paññā is different
from viññā�a in the sense that it ... involves cognizing the nature of things on the basis of a ... systematic
training of the mind”.

The Majjhima-nikāya version continues by defining perception, [32] a definition not
found in its Madhyama-āgama parallel. According to the Mahāvedalla-sutta, consciousness cannot be separated from perception and feeling, since one cognises what
one feels and perceives.
The Madhyama-āgama presentation has a similar statement, differing in so far as instead of consciousness it speaks of “intention”, explaining that one forms intentions in
regard to what one feels and perceives. [33]
A discourse quotation in the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya combines the indications given
in the Mahāvedalla-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel. According to this discourse
quotation, feeling, perception, volition, and consciousness cannot be separated from
each other, since what one feels that one intends, what one intends that one perceives,
and what one perceives that one cognises. [34]
The Mahāvedalla-sutta next takes up mind-consciousness that is released from the
five faculties, a topic not covered in its Madhyama-āgama parallel. The Majjhima-nikāya version continues by taking up the purpose of wisdom, which it explains to be
“direct knowledge”, “penetrative knowledge”, and “abandoning”. [35] The Madhyamaāgama version’s treatment of the same topic explains that wisdom has the purpose of
leading to “disenchantment”, to “dispassion”, and to a “vision in accordance with reality”. [36] The two explanations thus complement each other, each presenting a succinct
definition of the purpose of wisdom in early Buddhism.
The next question in the Mahāvedalla-sutta concerns the conditions for the arising of
right view, a question the Madhyama-āgama version precedes by defining right view
as insight into the four noble truths. [37] Both versions agree in listing two conditions for
the arising of right view:

 - listening to someone else,

 - giving thorough attention. [38]

37 The same definition occurs frequently in the Pāli discourses, cf., e.g., [[SN45.8]] at SN V 8,30.
38 [[MN43]] at MN I 294,3 stipulates “thorough attention”, yoniso manasikāra, which has its counterpart in
[[MA211]] at T I 791a2 in “attention within oneself”, . A similar mode of rendering is found,
e.g., in [[SA843]] at T II 215b 思 21, which employs the expression “internal right attention”, as its
counterpart to yoniso manasikāra in its parallel [[SN55.5]] at SN V 347,20. Yoni literally means “womb”,
so that the expression yoniso conveys a sense of directing attention “down to its origin”, which in such
contexts would indeed be “internal” or “within oneself”; cf. also Anālayo 2009y. The two conditions for

272   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


The Mahāvedalla-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel next take up the conditions required for right view to lead to deliverance. According to the Majjhima-nikāya
version, these conditions are:

      - moral conduct,

      - learning,

      - conversation,

      - tranquillity,

      - insight. [39]
The Madhyama-āgama presentation agrees on four of these five factors, differing in
so far as it speaks of “truth” instead of “conversation”. [40]
The Mahāvedalla-sutta next lists the three types of existence, a listing not found in
its Madhyama-āgama parallel. Both versions agree, however, on relating the continuity
of existence to craving and ignorance. [41]
The Majjhima-nikāya version continues by examining the first jhāna. Although this
topic is absent from its Madhyama-āgama parallel, it occurs in the Madhyama-āgama
parallel to the Cū�avedalla-sutta. This Madhyama-āgama discourse, together with a
Tibetan parallel, agree with the Mahāvedalla-sutta on the five factors present in the
first jhāna. [42] The same Chinese and Tibetan parallels do not, however, contrast these
five factors with the five hindrances, as is the case in the Mahāvedalla-sutta. [43]

MN I 295   The Mahāvedalla-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel take up the five faculties
in similar terms, explaining that the mind is the common resort of these five faculties. [44]

the arising of right view are also mentioned in the Yogācārabhūmi, cf. Delhey 2009a: 223,18 and T 1579
at T XXX 343b22.
39 [[MN43]] at MN I 294,10 lists sīla, suta, sākacchā, samatha, and vipassanā, a listing found similarly in
[[AN10.18]] at AN III 21,2.
40 [[MA211]] at T I 791a10 lists truth, morality, learning, tranquillity, and insight,,,,, and .
The reference to “truth” might be a misreading of sākacchā (or more precisely of whatever equivalent to
this term would have been found in the Indic original of the Madhyama-āgama) for sacca.
41 [[MN43]] at MN I 294,18 and [[MA211]] at T I 791a16. [[AN3.76]] at AN I 223,22+29 records a similar statement.
42 [[MA210]] at T I 788c20 and D (4094) mngon pa, ju 8a1 or Q (5595) tu 8b8. A discourse quotation from the
present exposition in the *Mahāvibhā�ā, T 1545 at T XXVII 814a2, also associates this topic with the
discourse given by Dhammadinnā. Given that this exposition is found in [[MA210]] and Abhidh-k-�, its
absence from [[MA211]] is thus not necessarily a sign of the five factor analysis being a later development,
pace Deleanu 2006b: 516.
43 [[MN43]] at MN I 294,36. This contrasting of the five factors of absorption with the five hindrances in MN 真諦 戒 博聞 止 觀
43 appears to be the only such instance in the Pāli discourses. While [[MN43]] merely lists these two sets
of factors one after the other, Vism 141,11 works out a one-to-one correspondence, explaining that concentration (samādhi) counters the first hindrance of sensual desire, joy (pīti) counters the hindrance of ill
will, initial mental application (vitakka) counters sloth-and-torpor, happiness (sukha) counters restlessness-and-worry, and sustained mental application (vicāra) counters doubt. For a critical examination of
this one-to-one correspondence cf. Stuart-Fox 1989: 100.
44 A discourse quotation on the relationship between mind and the five faculties can be found in the *Mahāvibhā�ā, T 1545 at T XXVII 903a9. Before turning to this topic, [[MA211]] at T I 791b8 inquires about
cessation, a topic not taken up in [[MN43]] Another Pāli discourse, [[SN48.42]] at SN V 218,5, has a se

Chapter 5 Cū�ayamaka-vagga                                   -  273


The two versions agree that the five faculties and the mind depend on vitality, and vitality in turn depends on heat. [45] Both illustrate the interrelation between vitality and
heat with the example of the light and the flame of a lamp. [46]
The Mahāvedalla-sutta next inquires whether there is a difference between vital formations and felt experience, [47] a question not found in its Madhyama-āgama parallel.
The two versions agree, however, that a body bereft of vitality, heat, and consciousness
is dead. [48] The Mahāvedalla-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel contrast the case
of being dead with the attainment of cessation, with which vitality has not come to an
end, heat has not become dissipated, and the faculties are not broken up. A quotation of
this passage in Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya adds that
during the attainment of cessation consciousness has also not ceased. [49]
The Madhyama-āgama version continues investigating the attainment of cessation, a
discussion whose corresponding Pāli treatment occurs in the Cū�avedalla-sutta.
The Mahāvedalla-sutta next takes up the neither-pleasant-nor-painful deliverance of
the mind, [50] a topic covered in its Madhyama-āgama parallel under the heading “imper

46 A minor difference is that [[MN43]] at MN I 295,25 simply explains that vitality depends on heat and heat
on vitality, and then illustrates this with the simile of the lamp, while [[MA211]] at T I 791b27 leads over
to the same topic with the question of whether vitality and heat are conjoined or disjoined phenomena,
followed by explaining that they are conjoined and interdependent phenomena, which [[MA211]] then
illustrates with the lamp simile, a passage also found in D (4094) mngon pa, ju 165b2 or Q (5595) tu
191a4.
47 [[MN43]] at MN I 295,36, Jaini 1959: 540 notes that the present passage “recognizes āyu as a factor which
stabilizes the five indriyas, but does not include it in any of the nāma-khandhas”. Such an inclusion, he
points out, would in fact be difficult, since to place āyu among the mental aggregates would conflict
with the continuity of life in the asañña-bhava, whereas to allocate it to the aggregate of form would not
suit the continuity of life in the arūpa-loka.

turbable concentration”. [51] This difference appears to be merely a matter of formulation,
since both the “neither-pleasant-nor-painful deliverance of the mind” and the “imperturbable concentration” refer to the degree of concentration reached with the fourth
jhāna. The two versions stipulate four conditions for reaching this attainment. [52]
The Mahāvedalla-sutta and its parallel in the Madhyama-āgama also examine the
signless deliverance of the mind. They agree on the two conditions required for its attainment, [53] but disagree on the conditions for its persistence, and for emerging from its
attainment. [54] According to the Pāli version, to remain in the signless deliverance requires three conditions:

51 [[MA211]] at T I 792a28: .
52 Judging from the context, in [[MN43]] at MN I 296,27 these four conditions appear to be the “overcoming
of happiness”, sukhassa ca pahānā, the “overcoming of pain”, dukkhassa ca pahānā, and the “previous
leaving behind of joy and sadness”, pubbe va somanassadomanassāna� atthagamā (B [e] -MN I 370,16
and C [e] -MN I 696,3: attha�gamā, S [e] -MN I 543,12: a��ha�gamā), four factors that form part of the standard description of the fourth jhāna (for a comparative study of the point at which domanassa is left behind during the jhānas according to different Pāli and Chinese sources cf. Kuan 2005). [[MA211]] at T I
792b1, however, begins by mentioning the overcoming of sensuality and evil things, a formulation that
corresponds to the standard description of the first jhāna, and then indicates that the standard treatment
of the jhānas should be continued up to the attainment of the fourth jhāna,
Thus in its presentation, the four conditions required for being able to attain imper- 不移動定
turbability appear to be the removal of sensuality and the development of the lower three jhānas.
53 The same two conditions are also listed in the Yogācārabhūmi, cf. Delhey 2009a: 186,3 and T 1579 at T
XXX 337b20.
54 [[MA211]] at T I 792b12 speaks of the, which literally translated would be “unconscious (asaññā)
concentration”. Such a concentration, however, would not fit the treatment in the present discourse, so
that it seems probable that “perception”,, in the present context should be read “sign”,, instead, a
suggestion which can claim for support a variant reading at T I 792b14. That the proper reading in
[[MA211]] should indeed be finds confirmation in the Karmasiddhiprakara�a, which quotes the Mahākau��hila-sūtra on the two conditions required for entering “signless” concentration or attainment, 若比丘離欲, 離惡不善之法, cf.
至得第四禪成就遊. T 1609 at T XXXI 784b18: and the Tibetan version in Lamotte 1936: 196,22: mtshan ma
med pa’i dbyings. Choong 1999: 116 note 220 draws attention to another similar instance in [[SA272]] at
T II 72a26, where a counterpart to animitta in [[SN22.80]] at SN III 93,23 reads “signless”, but has a
variant reading as, “unconscious”. The reverse case occurs in [[MA146]] at T I 657c4 as part of a
description of sense-restraint, which in the parallel [[MN27]] at MN I 180, 無想定 27 is concerned with the “sign”,
nimitta, but in [[MA146]] reads, “perception”, with a variant reading, “sign”. A complementary
case is [[MA187]] at T I 733c19, which uses the character 想, “sign”, to describe the practice of sense-re- 相
straint, but then has, “perception”, as a 聖 and variant reading for the same context. Again, in
[[MA169]] at T I 701c1 the expression 無相 “not connected with benefit”,, has as a variant instead of . [[MA34]] at T I 475b8+16 takes up the absence of pride with the phrase,

 - not giving attention to any sign,

 - giving attention to the signless element,

 - prior determination. [55]
The Madhyama-āgama version agrees on the first two, but does not mention the need
for prior determination. In order to emerge from the same attainment, according to the
Majjhima-nikāya account two conditions are required:

 - giving attention to signs,

 - not giving attention to the signless element.
The Madhyama-āgama version agrees on these two, to which it adds as a third condition the body together with the six sense-spheres conditioned by the life faculty. [56]
The Mahāvedalla-sutta at this point also examines the immeasurable deliverance of
the mind, the deliverance through nothingness, the deliverance through emptiness, and
the signless deliverance of the mind from the viewpoint of similarity or difference. This
discussion does not occur in its Madhyama-āgama parallel. [57]

concentration,, with the better fitting “signless concentration”,, as a and
variant reading. Yet another case can be found in T 6 at T I 180a16, which speaks of the samādhi used
by the Buddha to overcome an illness as, “concentration by not giving attention to numerous perceptions”, while the corresponding Sanskrit fragment [[SN360]] folio 171V4 in Waldschmidt
1950: 18 and the Tibetan version in Waldschmidt 1951: 195,1 speak instead of “not giving attention to
any signs”, sarvanimi(ttānām amanasikārād) and mtshan ma thams cad yid la mi bya bar. The idea to
not give attention to “signs”, sabbanimittānam amanasikārā, occurs also in the corresponding passage
in [[DN16]] at DN II 100,16, although not explicitly as the means used by the Buddha to overcome his illness. The Chinese (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya similarly speaks of the “signless concentration” at this
point, T 1451 at T XXIV 387a22: . These instances indicate that the two characters and
were prone to being confused with each other, so that the correct reading needs to be established in each 無想之定 無相之定 宋, 元, 明
case based on the context; cf. also Bapat 1937c: 30-31, Harrison 1990: 35, and Nattier 2003a: 300 note
619 for other instances where these two characters seem to have been confused with each other. A con- 不念眾想之定
fusion of and could be due to the circumstances of translation, especially in such cases when a
foreign translator would render an Indic original orally into Chinese, which in turn was written down by
his Chinese collaborators (cf. Zacchetti 1996: 350). The two characters and are not only fairly
similar in writing, differing only on the presence or absence of the heart radical, but also apparently
had a rather similar pronunciation in Early Middle Chinese (cf. Pulleyblank 1991: 337 and 338 or Unger
1989: 89). Thus a misunderstanding between a foreign translator and a Chinese scribe could easily occur.
Due to the related meaning of the two 無相三昧 characters, such a misunderstanding would then stand good 相 chances 想
of not being noticed during a later checking of the translation. Yìnshùn 1985/1986: 61, based on his extensive readings in the Chinese canon, comes to the conclusion that the ‘unconscious concentration of
the mind’ should simply be considered as an alternative rendering for ‘signless concentration of the
mind’, ( 相 想 ).

57 [[MA211]] at T I 792b7 briefly takes up the conditions required for the attainment of nothingness, a topic
also found in [[MN43]] at MN I 297,32 as part of the discussion of the four types of deliverance. Since [[MA211]] does not refer to the immeasurable deliverance of the mind at all, the present instance is a case where
the Chinese version does not mention the brahmavihāras, while the Pāli version includes them in its
presentation (cf. also above p. 220 and 261). According to [[SN41.7]] at SN IV 296,5 and [[SA567]] at T II

276   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


Instead of discussing the similarity or difference between various types of deliverance of the mind, the Madhyama-āgama version inquires into the similarity or difference between emptiness, desirelessness, and signlessness, explaining that these three
are different in meaning and different in letter. [58]
This suggestion seems to stand in contrast to the Mahāvedalla-sutta, according to
which unshakeable deliverance of the mind is a form of emptiness (due to being empty
of lust, anger, and delusion) and at the same time also constitutes the peak of signlessness. [59] Thus according to the Mahāvedalla-sutta, emptiness and signlessness can refer
to the same thing, in the sense that in this instance the two terms differ only in letter,
but not in meaning. According to the commentary to the Mahāvedalla-sutta, this passage is concerned with the concentration on the fruit of arahant-ship, an explanation
that would allow extending the similarity to desirelessness as well. [60] Hence from the
perspective of the Mahāvedalla-sutta, it seems that, although there is a way according
to which emptiness, desirelessness, and signlessness are different in meaning, there is a
way according to which they only differ in letter.


[[MN44]] Cū�avedalla-sutta

The Cū�avedalla-sutta, the “lesser discourse of the question-and answer type”, records the answers given by the nun Dhammadinnā to a series of questions. This discourse has a Chinese parallel in the Madhyama-āgama, [61] in addition to which a complete version of this discourse has been preserved as a discourse quotation in Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya, extant in Tibetan. [62]


149c13, a discussion similar to the present part of [[MN43]] took place on another occasion between the
householder Citta and a monk.
58 [[MA211]] at T I 792a25: .
59 [[MN43]] at MN I 298,22: “as far as there are signless deliverances of the mind, unshakeable deliverance
of the mind constitutes the peak of them, this unshakeable deliverance of the mind is empty of lust,
empty of anger, and empty of delusion”, yāvatā ... animittā cetovimuttiyo akuppā tāsa� cetovimutti aggam akkhāyati, sā kho panākuppā cetovimutti suññā rāgena suññā dosena suññā mohena.

61 The parallel is [[MA210]] at T I 788a-790b and has the title “discourse by the nun [called] Delight in the
Dharma”, (where, as noted by Minh Chau 1964/1991: 24, the rendering of the proper
name could be based on Dharmanandī, or perhaps Dharmanandā). While [[MN44]] takes place in the Bamboo Grove by Rājagaha, [[MA210]] and Abhidh-k-� take place in Jeta’s Grove by Sāvatthī. [[MA210]] has
been studied and translated by Minh Chau 1964/1991: 56, 75, 76, 98, 105-106, 113, and 269-278; MN 空, 無願, 無相, 此三法異義, 異文

“the discourse by Dharmadinnā”, on the Tibetan version cf. Schmithausen 1987: 338-343, Skilling
2001a:148, and Vetter 2000: 121-127, for a translation cf. Anālayo 2011b. For discourse quotations in

Chapter 5 Cū�ayamaka-vagga                                   -  277


The Cū�avedalla-sutta begins by describing how the male lay follower Visākha vis- MN I 299
ited the nun Dhammadinnā. [63] According to the Madhyama-āgama report, however, the
person who came to put questions to Dhammadinnā was the female lay follower Visākhā, also known as “Migāra’s Mother”. [64] In accordance with the different identity of
their protagonists, the Pāli version is situated in Rājagaha, the hometown of Dhammadinnā’s husband, the merchant Visākha, while the Madhyama-āgama version takes
place at Sāvatthī, the town where lady Visākhā was living. Although the Tibetan version is also located at Sāvatthī, it agrees with the Pāli version in as much as here Dhammadinnā’s visitor is the male Visākha. [65]
The series of questions and answers taking place between the nun Dhammadinnā and
her interlocutor differ in the three versions, with some questions from the Pāli discourse
not found in its Chinese and Tibetan parallels, and other questions from the Chinese
and Tibetan discourse not occurring in the Pāli version. In fact, even the Chinese and
Tibetan versions, although presumably stemming from closely related lines of transmission, differ from each other (see table 5.3). [66]

63 Ps II 355,29 offers some additional background to this meeting. According to its account, the merchant
Visākha was the former husband of Dhammadinnā and as a lay disciple of the Buddha had progressed to
the level of non-return. Since he was no longer able to continue his marital relationship as before, he offered Dhammadinnā his wealth and the freedom to do whatever she felt appropriate, upon which she decided to go forth as a nun. Once gone forth, she left Rājagaha for seclusion and intensive practice and
within a short time became an arahant, after which she returned to Rājagaha. On hearing that she had returned so soon from seclusion, her former husband decided to visit her in order to find out the reasons
for her return. Thus according to the commentarial account, the questions posed by the non-returner Visākha in the Cū�avedalla-sutta had the purpose of testing out Dhammadinnā’s wisdom, in order to find
out if she had reached realization, or if she had just been unable to adapt to the living conditions of being in seclusion. The same tale recurs with some variations in Mp I 360,17, translated by Bode 1893:
562-566 and summarized by Talim 1972: 117-118; and in Thī-[[AN15.15]] translated or summarized by
Rhys Davids 1909/1989: 12, Murcott 1991: 62, and Pruitt 1998/1999: 26-30. Another occurence of the
tale is Dhp-a IV 229,1, translated in Burlingame 1921c: 226-227. For an account of her past and present
experiences cf. Therī-apadāna, Ap 23.1-36 at Ap 567-569. A different account of Dhammadinnā’s going forth can be found in the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, cf. Finnegan 2009: 157-160 and 202-207.
64 [[MA210]] at T I 788a17: . The *Mahāvibhā�ā translation by Xuánzàng ( ) quotes part
of this discourse and agrees with [[MN44]] on speaking of the male lay follower Visākha, T 1545 at T
XXVII 780c7: . The Vibhā�ā translation by Buddhavarman, however, agrees with [[MA210]] on speaking of the female lay follower Visākhā, T 1546 at T XXVIII 337b7: . For a
more detailed discussion of this difference on the identity of Dhammadinnā’s visitor cf. Anālayo 2007i:
32-34.
65 Abhidh-k-� introduces “[Vi-]śākha” by qualifying him with the Tibetan equivalent to āyu�mān, D (4094)
mngon pa, ju 6b3 or Q (5595) tu 7b1: tshe dang ldan pa sa ga, but then classifies him as a layman, D
(4094) mngon pa, ju 6b4 or Q (5595) tu 7b2: dge bsnyen sa ga, although then Dharmadinnā addresses
him again as āyu�mān, D (4094) mngon pa, ju 6b4 or Q (5595) tu 7b2: tshe dang ldan pa, a form of address she continues using throughout; cf. also the discussion below p. 517 on the use of 毘舍佉優婆夷 玄奘 āyasma or āyu�mān to address laity.
66 Minh Chau 1964/1991: 270 counts thirty questions in the Chinese and thirty-four in the Pāli version, out 毘舍佉鄔波索迦
of which twenty-two are common to both. Where the Chinese and the Tibetan versions differ, the Ti- 毘舍佉優婆夷
betan presentation tends to be closer to the Pāli discourse. Thus the present case does not fully conform

The Cū�avedalla-sutta and its parallels begin with an inquiry into “personality” or
“identity” (sakkāya). [68] The three versions define personality in terms of the five aggre

to a general tendency of Madhyama-āgama quotations in Śamathadeva’s commentary to be similar to
their Chinese Madhyama-āgama counterparts, noted by Skilling 2004: 6. For another exception to this
pattern cf. Schmithausen 1987: 338.
67 For ease of reference I follow the division of topics adopted in Ñā�amoli 1995/2005: 396-403. This does
not fully reflect the differences between the three versions, as sometimes such differences affect only
part of the treatment of a particular topic. Also, some topics take up more space than others in the actual
discussion, thus, e.g., the inquiry in [[MA210]] and Abhidh-k-� regarding cessation is rather brief. Yet, to
try to reflect all such variations within the limited space of a table would not be feasible.
68 As its counterpart to sakkāya, mentioned in [[MN44]] at MN I 299,7, [[MA210]] at T I 788a26 speaks of
“own body”,, which, as already noted by Vetter 2000: 120 note 39, renders svakāya instead of satkāya (although for “personality view”, [[MA210]] at times just uses, cf. the quote in note 69 below).
An additional discourse quotation in Abhidh-k-� at D (4094) mngon pa, ju 268b1 or Q (5595) thu 11b4

gates [affected by] clinging. The Pāli discourse continues by tracing the arising of personality to craving and its cessation to the cessation of craving, highlighting that the
noble eightfold path is the way to the cessation of personality. Such a question and answer exchange does not occur in the Chinese version, [69] although an inquiry regarding
the arising and cessation of personality can be found in the Tibetan parallel.
The three versions agree that clinging is neither identical with the five aggregates [affected by] clinging nor different from them. While the Pāli version indicates that the
expression “clinging” stands for desire and lust in relation to the five aggregates [affected by] clinging, [70] the Chinese and Tibetan version instead differentiate between the
“five aggregates [affected by] clinging” and the “five aggregates”, the difference being
whether the influxes and attachment are present or else absent. [71]
The Cū�avedalla-sutta and its parallels agree in tracing personality view to self-notions in regard to any of the five aggregates. [72] Such self-notions can, according to all
versions, take four forms:

 - taking the aggregate to be the self,

 - postulating the self as the owner of the aggregate,

 - assuming the aggregate to exist within the self,

 - locating the self within the aggregate. [73]
The next topic is the noble eightfold path, which according to all versions should be
reckoned a conditioned phenomenon. [74] The three versions also agree that the noble
eightfold path can be subsumed under the three aggregates of morality, concentration,
and wisdom. [75] They differ, however, on the implications of these three aggregates. Ac

69 Perhaps an examination of the arising and cessation of personality was also found earlier in [[MA210]]
since its analysis of personality view proceeds from inquiring after the non-existence of “personality
view”, [[MA210]] at T I 788b4: ?, to inquiring about the cessation of “personality”, [[MA210]] at T I 788b12, ? This stands a little out of context and may be a remnant of an earlier
examination of the arising and cessation of personality. A presentation corresponding to this section of
[[MN44]] can be found in [[SN22.105]] at SN III 159,9 and its parallels [[SA71]] at T II 18c2 and D (4094)
mngon pa, ju 268b1 or Q (5595) thu 11b4, which agree with [[SN22.105]] in mentioning the arising, cessation, and path to the cessation of personality.

de Silva 1984; for a survey of the twenty modes of such self-notions in various texts cf. Wayman 1979.

75 An additional discourse quotation in Abhidh-k-� at D (4094) mngon pa, ju 62a5 or Q (5595) tu 69a1 parallels the exposition of the relation between the factors of the noble eightfold path and the three aggre

cording to the Pāli version, right effort belongs to the aggregate of concentration, while
the Chinese and Tibetan versions include right effort in the aggregate of wisdom. [76]
According to the standard definition given in the discourses, right effort stands for
making an effort to prevent and overcome unwholesome qualities, and to arouse and
develop their wholesome counterparts. [77] Keeping in mind this basic definition, in order
to further investigate the above difference the Mahācattarīsaka-sutta and its parallels
can be taken into account. The three versions of this discourse indicate that right view
and right effort, together with right mindfulness, are needed to develop the other factors of the noble eightfold path. [78] Here to discriminate between right and wrong manifestations of each path factor is the task of right view, while right effort stands for the
actual overcoming of what is wrong and the establishing of what is right. Thus the wise
distinction between what is wholesome and what is unwholesome should be attributed
to right view, which the Cū�avedalla-sutta and its parallels do indeed place in the aggregate of wisdom.
Hence right effort as the actual implementation of the wise distinction engendered by
right view is what keeps the mind on the proper track, and thereby in turn leads to concentration, so that the concentration aggregate does seem to be the most appropriate
placing for right effort.
This conclusion receives further support from two discourses in the A�guttara-nikāya.
One of these two discourses identifies the activities described in the standard formulation of the four right efforts to be efforts at “restraining”, “removing”, “developing”,
and “protecting”. [79] The other A�guttara-nikāya discourse explains these four terms to
refer to sense-restraint, to removing unwholesome thoughts, to developing the factors

Johnston 1928: 115,17. The same could perhaps also be implicit in a sequential difference in the listing

1897: 331,13, which places right effort in third position, after right view and right intention, and thus
before right action, right livelihood, right speech, right mindfulness, and right concentration. This mode
of listing would provide a closer relationship between right effort and the two factors that according to
all traditions are part of the aggregate of wisdom, right view and right intention. The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-(upadeśa-)śāstra in T 1509 at T XXV 203a24, however, agrees in this respect with [[MN44]] as
it counts only two members in the aggregate of wisdom.

of awakening (bojjha�ga), and to protecting the sign of concentration (samādhinimitta). [80] These explanations further support the close relationship between right effort and
concentration. [81]
The same conclusion suggests itself also from the continuation of the series of questions and answers in the Cū�avedalla-sutta and its parallels, where the Pāli version reckons the four right efforts to be the “requisites” of concentration. [82] The Chinese and Tibetan versions present them similarly as the “strength” or perhaps “power” of concentration. [83] Hence all versions, although using different terminology, agree on the close
relation of right effort to concentration, which would support the Cū�avedalla-sutta’s
placing of right effort into the aggregate of concentration.
The three parallel versions continue by explaining concentration to be one-pointedness of mind, followed by identifying the four satipa��hānas as the “sign” of concentration (samādhinimitta). [84] The Madhyama-āgama discourse, moreover, explains that the
four ways to [psychic] power (iddhipāda) are the “achievement” of concentration. [85]
The three versions conclude this topic by indicating that the development of concentration consists in the cultivation of these practices.
The Cū�avedalla-sutta next takes up the three types of formation (sa�khāra), a topic
not covered in its Chinese parallel, although the same is taken up in the Tibetan version.
The otherwise similar treatment in the Pāli and Tibetan versions varies on the nature of
mental formations, which according to the Cū�avedalla-sutta are perception and feeling,
whereas the Tibetan version speaks of perception and intention. [86]
The same difference recurs in regard to a reference to the three formations in a discourse in the Sa�yutta-nikāya and in its Sa�yukta-āgama parallel, [87] where the Sa�yut

MN I 301


282   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


ta-nikāya discourse defines mental formation by way of perception and feeling, [88] while
the Sa�yukta-āgama version instead speaks of perception and intention. [89] The definition by way of perception and intention recurs also in other works, such as the *Mahāvibhā�ā and the Śāriputrābhidharma. [90]
The Cū�avedalla-sutta next examines the cessation of perceptions and feelings (saññāvedayitanirodha). [91] The three versions agree that to attain cessation depends on
having previously developed the mind accordingly. [92] While the Pāli and Tibetan versions give the same reason for emerging from cessation, according to the Chinese account emergence from cessation is due to the body and the six sense-spheres conditioned by the life faculty. [93] The three versions agree that the mind of one who emerges
from cessation inclines to seclusion. [94]
When discussing different aspects in relation to the attainment of cessation, the Cū�avedalla-sutta states that:

 - first the verbal formation ceases (i.e., initial and sustained mental application),

 - next the bodily formation (i.e., breathing in and out),

 - then the mental formation ceases (i.e., perception and feeling). [95]
The Tibetan version also stipulates that the verbal formation ceases first, followed by
the bodily and mental formations. [96] Although the Madhyama-āgama parallel to the Cū�avedalla-sutta does not cover this topic, a counterpart to this discussion can be found
in the Madhyama-āgama parallel to the Mahāvedalla-sutta, whose presentation is as
follows:

 - first the bodily formation ceases,

 - next the verbal formation,

 - then the mental formation. [97]
In the case of emergence from cessation, the same difference recurs, although obviously in the reverse order.
That is, according to the Pāli and Tibetan versions the verbal formation is the last to
arise, [98] while according to the Chinese presentation the bodily formation arises last. [99]
In relation to the sequence in which the three formations cease, other Pāli discourses
indicate that during progress through the jhānas (required in order to be able to attain
cessation), the verbal formation of initial and sustained mental application would be
left behind on attaining the second jhāna, while the bodily formation of in- and outbreathing would only cease with the attainment of the fourth jhāna. [100] This corresponds
to the sequence proposed in the Cū�avedalla-sutta and its Tibetan parallel. This sequence receives further support from a discourse in the Sa�yukta-āgama and its Pāli
parallel. According to these two discourses, on attaining cessation the first formation to
cease is indeed the verbal formation of initial and sustained mental application. [101] The
*Mahāvibhā�ā also agrees with the sequence proposed in the Cū�avedalla-sutta and its
Tibetan parallel. [102]
Another disagreement between the Cū�avedalla-sutta and its parallels concerns the
three contacts experienced by one who emerges from cessation. According to the Pāli
presentation, these three contacts are:

 - empty contact,

 - signless contact,

 - desireless contact. [103]
The Chinese and Tibetan versions list:

 - imperturbable contact,

 - nothingness contact,

 - signless contact. [104]

The presentation in the Chinese and Tibetan versions of the three types of contact experienced when emerging from cessation recurs in a discourse in the Sa�yukta-āgama
and in other works. [105] These agree with the Chinese and Tibetan parallels to the Cū�avedalla-sutta that these three contacts are indeed imperturbable contact, nothingness
contact, and signless contact.

MN I 302   The Cū�avedalla-sutta and its parallels next take up the three types of feeling. They
agree that:

      - pleasant feeling is pleasant while it lasts, but unpleasant when it changes,

      - painful feeling is unpleasant while it lasts, but pleasant when it changes,

      - neutral feeling is pleasant when known, but unpleasant when not known. [106]

MN I 303   The three versions also concur that:

      - the tendency to lust does not underlie pleasant feelings that arise during the first
jhāna, [107]

      - the tendency to aversion does not underlie unpleasant feelings that arise due to
the wish for liberation,

      - the tendency to delusion does not underlie neutral feelings that are experienced
in the fourth jhāna.

MN I 304   The Cū�avedalla-sutta and its parallels continue by delineating a series of counterparts. These proceed from pleasant feeling to Nirvā�a. The three versions begin this series of counterparts by presenting pleasant feeling and painful feeling as mutual counterparts. The Pāli version next turns to the counterpart to neutral feeling. Before taking

presents itself as belonging to the Mahākau��hila-sūtra, thereby following [[MA211]] in presenting this
topic as part of a discussion between Sāriputta and Mahāko��hita. These three contacts are also
mentioned (as part of a discussion on the attainment of cessation that touches on several points made in
the present discourse) in the Yogācārabhūmi, cf. Delhey 2009a: 208,3 and T 1579 at T XXX 341a8.
105 [[SA568]] at T II 150c3, the *Mahāvibhā�ā, T 1545 at T XXVII 781b8, the *Tattvasiddhi, T 1646 at T
XXXII 346a24, and the Yogācārabhūmi, T 1579 at T XXX 341a8; cf. also Schmithausen 1987: 396397.
106 [[MA210]] at T I 789c4 actually indicates that neutral feeling is unpleasant when not known and pleasant
when not known,,, which I take to be a textual error. Another point worthy of note is
that [[MN44]] at MN I 303,4 speaks of each feeling as being either “present” or else “changing”, �hiti or
viparināma, whereas [[MA210]] at T I 789c1 and D (4094) mngon pa, ju 10b4 or Q (5595) tu 11b7 deal
with the same topic in a threefold manner by additionally also mentioning the “arising” of feeling,
, skye ba, gnas pa, yongs su ’gyur ba. Thus in the case of pleasant feelings, for example, according to [[MA210]] their arising is pleasant, their presence is pleasant, but their change is unpleasant.
Such a three-fold mode of presentation is also found in the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya, Abhidh-k 6:3 in
Pradhan 1967: 329,5: utpāda ... sthiti ... vipari�āma, with its Chinese counterparts in T 1558 at T XXIX
114b15 and T 1559 at T XXIX 266c1, and a more extensive discourse quotation in Abhidh-k-� at D
(4094) mngon pa, nyu 4b2 or Q (5595) thu 36a1, which thus parallels the examination of the nature of
pleasant feeling in [[MN44]] at MN I 303, 不知苦 不知樂 3.
107 Abhidh-k-� at D (4094) mngon pa, ju 10a3 or Q (5595) tu 11a5 makes the same statement also for the
second and the third absorption. An additional discourse quotation in Abhidh-k-� at D (4094) mngon
pa, ju 51b4 or Q (5595) tu 56a5 refers to the relationship between feelings and underlying tendencies, 生 ...
住 described in [[MN44]] at MN I 303, ... 變易 20; cf. also Abhidh-k 2:3 in Pradhan 1967: 39,19, with its Chinese
counterparts T 1558 at T XXIX 14a12 and T 1559 at T XXIX 173c2.


Chapter 5 Cū�ayamaka-vagga                                   -  285


up the counterpart to neutral feeling, the Chinese and Tibetan versions inquire after the
counterpart to pleasant and painful feelings together, which they explain to be neutral
feeling. [108] In this way, they provide a transition from pleasant and painful feelings to
neutral feelings, so that their series of questions consistently proceeds by inquiring into
the counterpart of the item mentioned in the preceding answer (see table 5.4).


Table 5.4: Listing of Counterparts in [[MN44]] and its Parallels

|[[MN44]]|[[MA210]] & Abhidh-k-T|
|---|---|
|pleasant feeling - painful feeling (1)<br>painful feeling - pleasant feeling (2)<br>neutral feeling - ignorance (3)<br>ignorance - knowledge (4)<br>knowledge - deliverance (5)<br>deliverance - NirvāUa (6)|pleasant feeling - painful feeling (→ 1)<br>painful feeling - pleasant feeling (→ 2)<br>pleasant & painful feeling - neutral feeling<br>neutral feeling - ignorance (→ 3)<br>ignorance - knowledge (→ 4)<br>knowledge - NirvāUa (→ 6)<br>(≠ 5)|



The three versions agree that the counterpart to neutral feeling is ignorance, and that
the counterpart to ignorance is knowledge. The Pāli version continues by indicating
that liberation is the counterpart to knowledge, and Nirvā�a is the counterpart to liberation. [109] The Chinese and Tibetan versions proceed directly from knowledge to Nirvā�a,
without mentioning liberation as an intermediate step.
The examination of counterparts culminates in an inquiry about the counterpart to Nirvā�a. In all versions, Dhammadinnā explains that such a question cannot be answered,
for Nirvā�a is the final goal of the holy life. [110]
This completes the series of questions and answers in both versions. According to the
Pāli version, the layman Visākha reported the whole conversation to the Buddha, who
approved of the answers given and indicated that he would have answered in just the
same way. According to the Chinese and Tibetan versions, however, the nun Dhammadinnā was the one to inform the Buddha about the conversation, which led to the same
approval. Although the three versions disagree on the identity of who gave an account
of this discussion to the Buddha, they agree that the Buddha authenticated and praised
Dhammadinnā’s exposition. [111] Her wisdom is also highlighted in the A�guttara-nikāya

108 [[MA210]] at T I 790a1 and D (4094) mngon pa, ju 10b6 or Q (5595) tu 12a2.
109 Similarly, a series of questions in [[SN48.42]] at SN V 218,11, which proceeds along the same lines of
finding a counterpart, also precedes Nirvā�a with liberation. However, this series does not include
knowledge, and instead presents liberation as the counterpart to mindfulness. Another example is [[SN23.1]] at SN III 189,24, which also proceeds along a similar series of topics, although it does not treat
these in terms of counterparts, a series where again liberation precedes Nirvā�[[AN110]] [[MA210]] at T I 790a16 adds that Nirvā�a has no counterpart, a statement also made in Ps II 370,18 and
Mil 316,1. Another exchange that similarly culminates in a query after Nirvā�a, which cannot be given
a proper reply, can be found in [[MA159]] at T I 682a29, a discourse without a Pāli parallel.
111 The three versions of the present discourse thus corroborate that from an early Buddhist perspective
gender is not relevant when it comes to realization and the development of wisdom, which is in fact


286   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


and Ekottarika-āgama lists of outstanding disciples, both of which mention her as foremost in the ability to expound the Dharma. [112]


[[MN45]] Cū�adhammasamādāna-sutta

The Cū�adhammasamādāna-sutta, the “lesser discourse on undertaking things”, distinguishes between four ways of undertaking things. This discourse has a parallel in the
Madhyama-āgama. [113]

MN I 305   The two versions begin by enumerating four ways of undertaking things, which are
either pleasant or else painful now, and each of these two may result in future pleasure
or in future pain.
The Cū�adhammasamādāna-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel agree in presenting what is pleasant now and painful in future as their first and what is pleasant
both now and in future as their last alternative. They differ in as much as the Pāli version takes up the way that is painful now and ripens in pain as its second alternative,
and the way that is painful now and ripens in pleasure as its third alternative, while in
the Chinese version these two occur in the opposite sequence (see table 5.5).
Such sequential variations are a recurring feature between Pāli and Chinese discourses. What makes this particular case noteworthy is that neither sequence corresponds to the pattern to be expected, since in the discourses such enumerations usually

explicitly stated in [[AN8.51]] at AN IV 276,10 and its parallel [[MA116]] at T I 605b28; cf. also [[SN1.46]] at
SN I 33,11 (or SN [2] 46 at SN [2] I 70,1) and its parallels [[SA587]] at T II 156a22 and SĀ [2] 171 at T II 437a24.
112 [[AN1.75]] at AN I 25,21 qualifies her as a dhammakathikā, “speaker on the Dharma”, while [[EA5.2]] at T
II 559a13 speaks of her ability to “discriminate the meaning” and to “widely discourse on divisions and
parts” [of the teaching], . Dhammadinnā’s wisdom is also reflected in the Pāli
commentaries: According to Thī-[[AN55.25]] Dhammadinnā was the teacher under whom the nun Sukkā
went forth, learnt meditation, and became an arahant, a nun who then became an outstanding teacher
herself. Thī-[[AN74.27]] reports that another nun, who had been unable to gain concentration for twenty-five
years, was able to develop her practice and eventually attain the six supernormal knowledges
(abhiññās) after hearing a discourse spoken by Dhammadinnā. According to a discourse in the Ekottarika-āgama, on one occasion Dhammadinnā also lectured Devadatta on the need to repent his evil
deeds. [[EA49.9]] at T II 803c25 reports that Devadatta got so infuriated by this reprimand that he hit
Dhammadinnā until she passed away. Devadatta’s killing of a nun is also reported in the Sa�ghabhedavastu, Gnoli 1978a: 254,20, and in the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-(upadeśa-)śāstra, T 1509 at T XXV
165a4, cf. also T 1464 at T XXIV 857c 分別義趣, 廣說分部 20, although in these texts the nun in question is Utpalavar�ā.
According to Deeg 1999: 197 and Lamotte 1949/1981: 875 note 1, this tale is a late development
whose function is to arrive at a triad of heinous crimes committed by Devadatta (in addition to his
creating a schism and wounding the Buddha).
113 The parallel is [[MA174]] at T I 711b-712c, which agrees with [[MN45]] on locating the discourse in Jeta’s
Grove by Sāvatthī and on the title “discourse on undertaking things”, (Hirakawa 1997: 228 indicates that can also render sam-ā-√dā), although without the qualification “lesser”. The qualification “lesser” would in fact not have suited [[MA174]] as the counts of Chinese characters given at T I
712c3 and T I 713c16 indicate that [[MA174]] is longer than [[MA175]] the Madhyama-āgama parallel to
the “greater discourse on undertaking things”, [[MN46]] On [[MA174]] cf. also Minh Chau 1964/1991:
196-197.

proceed from the most negative case to the most positive. This is in fact the sequence
followed in the Sa�gīti-sutta’s treatment of the same topic, which begins with the way
of undertaking things that is painful in both respects, followed by what is painful only
now, what is painful only in the future, and then what is pleasant both now and in the
future. [114]
The next discourse in the Majjhima-nikāya, the Mahādhammasamādāna-sutta, conforms to the same general pattern, as it also places what is painful in both respects first
and turns to what is pleasant in both respects as its last, although it differs from the
Sa�gīti-sutta in as much as it has what is pleasant now and painful in future as its second and what is painful now and pleasant in future as its third (see table 5.5). [115]


Table 5.5: Four Ways of Undertaking Things in [[MN45]] and Other Discourses

|[[MN45]]|[[MN46]]|

|pleasant - painful (1)<br>painful - painful (2)<br>painful - pleasant (3)<br>pleasant - pleasant (4)|painful - painful (→ 2)<br>pleasant - painful (→ 1)<br>painful - pleasant (→ 3)<br>pleasant - pleasant (→ 4)|

Thus, in spite of a strong tendency of oral transmission in general to standardize enumerations, the above Pāli discourses differ in the sequence of their presentation of the
same topic. This is particularly remarkable in the case of the Cū�adhammasamādānasutta and the Mahādhammasamādāna-sutta, two discourses that immediately follow
each other within the same textual corpus transmitted by Majjhima-nikāya bhā�akas,
where one might have expected to find the same sequence in these two consecutive discourses.
This goes to show that even within a single reciter tradition, such as among the Majjhima-nikāya bhā�akas or among the reciters of the four Nikāyas of the Theravāda
tradition, standardization has not invariably been the norm. Instead, even discourses
passed on side-by-side can exhibit variations that would presumably have come into
being either at the time of their delivery or at an early stage in their transmission, being

Sa�gīti-sūtra in Stache-Rosen 1968: 115 may have suffered from a misprint, since its restoration presents the way that is pleasant in both respects twice. The parallel to the Sa�gīti-sūtra in the Chinese
Dīrgha-āgama, [[DA9]] at T I 50c2, agrees with [[DN33]] while another translation of the Sa�gīti-sūtra, T
12 at T I 229a18, follows the sequence found in [[MN45]]

simply sequential variations that in themselves do not appear to result in a significant
difference in regard to the import of the teaching given.
In contrast to the variations found in this case among Theravāda reciters, the Sarvāstivāda tradition presents the four ways of undertaking things in a more uniform
manner, since the Chinese parallels to the Cū�adhammasamādāna-sutta and the Mahādhammasamādāna-sutta agree with each other and with the Sa�gītiparyāya on the sequence of presenting these four ways of undertaking things. [116]

MN I 307   The Cū�adhammasamādāna-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel explain in similar ways that the way of undertaking things that is pleasant now but ripens in future
pain stands for recluses and Brahmins who indulge in sensual pleasures with women, [117]
as a result of which they will experience rebirth in hell. [118] Both versions compare this
predicament to the fate of a sāla tree gradually overgrown by a creeper. [119]
The Cū�adhammasamādāna-sutta and its parallel illustrate the way of undertaking
things that is painful now and painful in future with the example of various ascetic
practices and self-mortifications in vogue in ancient India, practices that according to
both versions tend to lead to a lower rebirth. The Madhyama-āgama version’s list of
such practices takes up not only the observance of pulling out the hair and beard, mentioned in the Majjhima-nikāya version, but also the practice of shaving them. [120] Since
Buddhist monks regularly shave their hair and beard, it is somewhat unexpected to find
such shaving included among practices that lead to a lower rebirth.

MN I 308   The two versions present the way of undertaking things that is painful now and pleasant in the future in similar ways, indicating that those who live the holy life in purity,
even though they suffer due to being under the strong influence of lust, anger, or delu

116 [[MA175]] at T I 712c13 agrees with the sequence found in [[MA174]] at T I 711b21. The same sequence recurs also in another parallel to [[MN46]] T 83 at T I 902b15. The Sa�gītiparyāya, T 1536 at T XXVI 398c6,
translated in Stache-Rosen 1968: 115, also has the same sequence as [[MA174]] (on the probable (Mūla-)
Sarvāstivāda affiliation of the Sa�gītiparyāya cf. Tripā�hī 1985: 198-199), as does the Mahāvyutpatti
no. 1560 in Sakaki 1926: 125.
117 [[MN45]] at MN I 305,22 stands alone in referring to these women as female wanderers, paribbājikā; on
this term cf. also Jyväsjärvi 2007.
118 Judging from [[AN3.111]] at AN I 266,3, the prospect of rebirth in hell awaits not only those who actually
engage in sex while pretending to be living a celibate life, but is also to be expected for simply having
the view that there is no harm in sensual indulgence and then acting accordingly, even if this is done
without feigning celibacy.
119 In the context of this simile, [[MN45]] at MN I 306,12 indicates that the seed of such a creeper might become a “no-seed”, abīja� vā pan’ assa. [[MA174]] at T I 711c11 helps to clarify the implication of this
expression, as it describes how this seed might rot and thus no longer be a seed capable [of sprouting],
. The expression ‘no-seed’ occurs also in the Jain Viyāhapa��atti 6.7.111 in Lalwani
1974: 290,6, according to which by losing the ability to sprout a seed becomes a ‘no-seed’.
120 [[MA174]] at T I 712b15: (followed by mentioning the practice of pulling out hair and beard).
The same reference to shaving the hair and beard recurs in listings of ascetic practices found in [[MA18]]
at T I 442a6 and [[MA104]] at T I 592b26, and also in a similar listing in [[DA8]] at T I 47c29. [[MN45]] at
MN I 308,6 and [[MA174]] at T I 712b12 agree, however, on including another practice undertaken by
Buddhist monks in their listing, namely the wearing of rag robes.

sion, will be reborn in heaven. [121] The way of undertaking things pleasant both now and
in future then stands for the complementary case of someone who lives the holy life
without being under the strong influence of lust, anger, or delusion.
The Majjhima-nikāya version illustrates the present and future pleasure experienced
by this person by describing the attainment of the four jhānas and rebirth in heaven. [122]
Its Madhyama-āgama parallel instead depicts how this person lives the holy life happily and eradicates the five lower fetters, thereby becoming a non-returner. [123] In this
way, the Madhyama-āgama version’s presentation of the fourth way of undertaking
things shows an orientation more typical for early Buddhist texts, in the sense that, as a
discourse addressed to a group of monks, it takes up the attainment of non-return instead of rebirth in heaven.


[[MN46]] Mahādhammasamādāna-sutta

The Mahādhammasamādāna-sutta, the “greater discourse on the way of undertaking
things”, distinguishes between four ways of undertaking things, thereby taking up the
same topic as the Cū�adhammasamādāna-sutta. This discourse has two Chinese parallels, one of which occurs in the Madhyama-āgama while the other is an individual translation. [124]
The Mahādhammasamādāna-sutta and its parallels begin by pointing out that even
though beings wish for an increase in pleasure and a decrease in disagreeable experiences, the very opposite takes place. [125] To explain this predicament, the Pāli version
distinguishes between an untaught worldling, who does not know what is to be cultivated, and a noble disciple, who knows what is to be cultivated. This distinction is not
found in its two Chinese parallels. The Pāli version continues by taking up the four
ways of undertaking things, listed also in the Chinese versions. [126]

121 [[MN45]] at MN I 308,21 and [[MA174]] at T I 712a20. [[AN8.8]] at AN II 149,18 refers to the same situation under the heading dukkhā pa�ipadā, a painful mode of practice.
122 [[MN45]] at MN I 309,2.
123 [[MA174]] at T I 712b27.
124 The parallels are [[MA175]] at T I 712c-713c and T 83 at T I 902b-903b. [[MA175]] agrees with [[MN46]] on
the title,, without, however, using the qualification “greater”, while T 83 has the title “discourse
spoken by the Buddha on proper things”, . According to the information provided in the
Taishō edition, T 83 was translated by Dharmarak�a. While [[MN46]] takes place in Jeta’s Grove by Sāvatthī, [[MA175]] and T 83 have the Kuru country as their location.
125 According to [[MN46]] at MN I 309,31, the Buddha had asked the monks for their opinion as to the reason for this situation, in reply to which the monks requested him to expound the matter. In [[MA175]] at T
I 712c10 and T 83 at T I 902b11, however, the Buddha continued his exposition without asking the opinion of the monks, pointing out that what he teaches leads to an increase of pleasant experiences and a
decrease of disagreeable experiences.
126 [[MN46]] at MN I 311,6 proceeds from what is painful now and in the future to what is pleasant now but
leads to pain, followed by what is painful now but leads to pleasure, and concludes with what is pleas- 受法經
ant in both respects. [[MA175]] at T I 712c14 and T 83 at T I 902b 佛說應法經 15 begin with what is pleasant now and
leads to pain, followed by what is painful now but leads to pleasure, then turn to what is painful in both

290   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


MN I 311 The three parallel discourses agree that a fool, who does not understand the four ways
of undertaking things, will do what should not be done and avoid what should be done,
as a result of which his pleasant experiences will diminish and disagreeable experiences will increase. A wise person, however, who understands the four ways of undertaking things, will do what should be done, therefore a wise one will experience an increase in pleasure and a decrease in disagreeable experiences.
A difference in the mode of presenting this examination is that the Mahādhammasamādāna-sutta at first takes up the case of one who does not know the four ways of
undertaking things, then describes one who knows the four ways, and only after this
explains what these four ways actually refer to. [127] In contrast, the two Chinese versions
first explain these four ways and then relate them to the ignorant and the wise respectively (see table 5.6). From a didactic perspective, the sequence in the Chinese versions
is convenient, since an understanding of the implications of these four ways forms the
basis for being able to appreciate why knowledge of them marks the distinction between a fool and a wise person.


Table 5.6: Progression of Main Topics in [[MN46]] and its Parallels

|[[MN46]]|[[MA175]] & T 83|

MN I 313   The more detailed exposition of these four ways of undertaking things in the Mahādhammasamādāna-sutta and its parallels distinguishes them according to whether a
person experiences pleasure or sadness when undertaking the ten unwholesome courses
of action, or else when abstaining from them. [128]
The Pāli version envisages rebirth in hell as the retribution for undertaking the ten
unwholesome courses of action, while to abstain from them will lead to rebirth in
heaven. The Chinese versions treat the same topic from a different perspective. According to their presentation, undertaking the ten unwholesome courses of action will


respects, and finally come to what is pleasant in both respects. On variations in the sequence of the four
ways of undertaking things cf. above p. 286.
127 [[MN46]] at MN I 310,7 defines the unlearned worldling and the learned noble disciple in terms of their
understanding or lack of understanding of the four ways of undertaking things, and only at MN I 310,35
explains these four ways of undertaking things.
128 [[MN46]] at MN I 313,29 indicates that the way of undertaking things that is pleasant now is done “with
happiness and joy”, sahāpi sukhena sahāpi somanassena. In the Chinese parallels, the same way of undertaking is instead undertaken with “own happiness and joy”, [[MA175]] at T I 712c17: and T
83 at T I 902c6:, cf. also Minh Chau 1964/1991: 326. This rendering could be mistaking
the preposition saha or sa, “with”, for the reflexive pronoun sa or sva. Such a mistake could more easily
occur if the Indic originals of [[MA175]] and T 83 had been in a Prākrit, in which the spelling of these
two words is similar.

prevent knowledge and realization of Nirvā�a, whereas such knowledge and realization
can be attained if the ten unwholesome courses of action are avoided. [129]
Hence in the present case, just as in the preceding Cū�adhammasamādāna-sutta, the
Chinese versions treat the benefits of properly undertaking things from the normative
Buddhist perspective, as they mention knowledge and realization of Nirvā�a instead of
rebirth in heaven.
The Mahādhammasamādāna-sutta and its parallels illustrate the four ways of undertaking things with four types of drink, which can be either sweet or bitter, and which
are either poisonous or else salutary. While the Pāli discourse presents all similes together at the end of its exposition, the Chinese versions introduce each simile after the
respective way of undertaking things it illustrates. Another difference is that in the Pāli
version’s similes someone informs the person of the advantages or disadvantages of the
respective drink, while the similes in the Chinese parallels do not mention such a
person.
The Pāli discourse concludes by proclaiming that the way of undertaking things that
is pleasant now and pleasant in the future outshines the teachings of all other ordinary
recluses and Brahmins. [130] The two parallels do not have such a statement, even though,
by relating this way of understanding more closely to the Buddhist path to deliverance,
their presentation would fit the role of outshining the teachings of others better than the
Mahādhammasamādāna-sutta’s version, which only teaches that abstaining from the
ten unwholesome courses of action will lead to a heavenly rebirth.


[[MN47]] Vīma�saka-sutta

The Vīma�saka-sutta, the “discourse on the inquirer”, describes how to undertake a
thorough examination of the Buddha’s claim to being an awakened teacher. This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama. [131]
The Vīma�saka-sutta and its parallel begin in similar ways by suggesting that a
monk, who does not have telepathic powers, [132] should examine the Buddha by way of


129 [[MA175]] at T I 712c25 speaks of “advancing in knowledge, advancing in realization, and advancing towards Nirvā�a”,, and T 83 at T I 902c10 refers to “accomplishing higher knowledge, reaching the even path, and being in conformity with Nirvā�a”, .
130 [[MN46]] at MN I 317,14.
131 The parallel is [[MA186]] at T I 731a-732a and has the title “discourse on investigating [for the sake of]
understanding”,, a brief survey of [[MN47]] can be found in Anālayo 2009p, a translation of [[MA186]] can be found in id. 2010l. While [[MN47]] takes place at Jeta’s Grove by Sāvatthī, [[MA186]] has Kammāsadhamma in the Kuru country as its location. Skilling 1997a: 341 notes a reference to a version of
the present discourse in an uddāna preserved in Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya at D (4094) mngon pa, ju 235b4 or Q (5595) tu 269a5. This reference has the reading rjes [su]

external observation in order to find out if the Buddha’s mental states were defiled,
mixed, or pure. [133] According to both versions, the result of such an inquiry will be that
only clean states are found in the Buddha.

MN I 318   The Majjhima-nikāya discourse continues by investigating whether the Buddha had
“attained” this wholesome dharma a long time ago or only recently. [134] The Madhyamaāgama version instead examines whether the Buddha has been “practicing” this dharma for a long time or if he only practices it temporarily. [135] Judging from this slightly
different formulation, the point at stake in the Madhyama-āgama version would not be
how long ago the Buddha had attained awakening, but whether he was consistent in his
conduct.
In fact, the question whether the Buddha is fully awakened or not would not depend
on how long he has been awakened. This much can be seen in a discourse found in the
Sa�yutta-nikāya, together with its Chinese and Sanskrit parallels. The different versions of this discourse agree that the Buddha once explained to King Pasenadi that the
level of realization of even a young monk recently gone forth should not be underestimated. [136] The reason for this declaration is closely related to the present instance, since
Pasenadi had expressed doubts about the Buddha’s claim to be fully awakened, due to
the Buddha’s young age at the time when their meeting took place. Thus according to
this discourse, to query whether the Buddha had only recently attained awakening
would not be a valid criterion for verifying his realization.
The Vīma�saka-sutta continues by investigating if the Buddha had acquired fame
without succumbing to the dangers that result from becoming famous. [137] The Madhyama-āgama version instead indicates that the Buddha’s practice of meditation was not


na, which the context indicates to be the preferable reading, pace Premasiri 2006b: 232-234, in fact the
corresponding passage in [[MA186]] at T I 731b3 speaks of “not knowing”, .
133 A small difference is that in [[MN47]] until MN I 318,22 the monk refers to the Buddha with the epithet
Tathāgata, but from MN I 318,25 onwards he refers to the Buddha as “this venerable one”, ayam āyasma. [[MA186]] is more consistent in this respect, since in its version the monk throughout refers to the
Buddha as “this venerable one”, .
134 [[MN47]] at MN I 318,23: dīgharatta� samāpanno ... udāhu ittarasamāpanno ti, which Ps II 382,5 explains to mean “since a long time ... or else ... yesterday”, cirakālato pa��hāya ... udāhu ... hiyyo.
135 [[MA186]] at T I 731b19: . The use of in [[MA186]] does not seem to be just a
free translation of an equivalent to the expression samāpanna found in the Pāli passage, since other
occurrences of the verb samāpajjati or its past participle samāpanna in the Majjhima-nikāya have their
counterparts in or in their Madhyama-āgama parallels, cf. [[MN43]] at MN I 296, 不知 12: samāpanno
and [[MA210]] at T I 789a11:, [[MN50]] at MN I 333,24: samāpanna� and [[MA131]] at T I 620c22:,
[[MN79]] at MN II 37,26: samāpajjati and [[MA208]] at T I 786a16:, [[MN106]] at MN II 262,15: samāpajjati and [[MA75]] at T I 542b22:, [[MN136]] at MN III 207,14: samāpanno and [[MA171]] at T I 706b22:
. This suggests that the original on which the translation of [[MA186]] was based had a different verb at 彼尊者
this point of its exposition. Hirakawa 1997: 1043 lists a broad range of possible equivalents to,
which, however, does not comprise samāpad.

motivated by desire for fame or profit. [138] Hence, although the two versions agree that
the Buddha was beyond the attraction of fame, they present this in a slightly different
manner, as the Madhyama-āgama version does not even envisage the possibility that
the Buddha could succumb to such dangers and instead highlights the meditative life
style of the Buddha.
The two versions continue by indicating that the external behaviour of the Buddha
was not influenced by fear, but was an expression of his aloofness from sensuality.
The Vīma�saka-sutta notes that the Buddha, whether dwelling alone or in company,
did not despise anyone, even those who behaved badly and were concerned with material things. In the Madhyama-āgama version this passage appears to have suffered
from some transmission or translation error, although it could be based on a similar
original. [139]
The two versions continue by describing how an investigating monk disciple will directly question the Buddha on the latter’s mental purity. In the Majjhima-nikāya version, the Buddha declares that he does not identify with his purity, a statement not found
in the Madhyama-āgama parallel. [140]
According to the Vīma�saka-sutta and its parallel, the culmination of this inquiry is
reached once the disciple acquires direct knowledge of the Dharma, at which point such
a disciple will be firmly convinced that the Buddha is indeed fully awakened. Faith
rooted in vision in this way, the two versions conclude, cannot be shaken by anyone in
the world. [141]


[[MN48]] Kosambiya-sutta

The Kosambiya-sutta, the “discourse to the Kosambians”, reports the Buddha teaching six memorable qualities to the quarrelling monks at Kosambī and enumerating
seven knowledges of a noble disciple. Of this discourse, so far no parallel appears to be
known. [142]

139 The passage in [[MA186]] at T I 731c1 refers to those who are “well-gone”,, which corresponds to

at MN I 319,14 (cf., e.g., [[MA98]] at T I 583c28, where corresponds to sāmisa in [[MN10]] at MN I 59,16);
and it concludes by mentioning “not knowing”,, which could be due to the translator mistaking
ava-√jñā _“_ to despise”, at MN I 319,15, for a+√jñā. Hence it seems that the main points made in [[MN47]]
can be discerned in the Chinese translation.

[[MN49]] Brahmanimanta�ika-sutta

The Brahmanimanta�ika-sutta, the “discourse on Brahmā’s invitation”, [143] records a
visit paid by the Buddha to a Brahmā in order to refute the latter’s mistaken belief that
his realm was permanent. [144] This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama. [145]
The first part of the Brahmanimanta�ika-sutta recurs, moreover, as a discourse in the
Sa�yutta-nikāya under the title Bakabrahma-sutta. [146]

MN I 326   The Brahmanimanta�ika-sutta, its Madhyama-āgama parallel, and the Bakabrahmasutta begin by reporting that a Brahmā, whom the Pāli versions identify as Baka the
Brahmā, believed his realm to be permanent and supreme, with nothing superior to it.
The Buddha, who had become aware of the deluded thought of this Brahmā, thereupon
decided to visit him. [147]


to [[MN48]] The second of the two discourses, [[EA24.8]] agrees with [[MN48]] on taking the Kosambī incident as its occasion, although its contents make it rather a parallel to [[MN128]] the Upakkilesa-sutta.
143 Regarding the title, both versions of the discourse conclude with an explanation by the reciters that the
title refers to Brahmā’s invitation to the Buddha, cf. [[MN49]] at MN I 331,31: brahmuno ca abhinimantanatāya, tasmā imassa veyyākara�assa brahmanimanta�ikan t’ eva adhivacanan ti (B [e] -MN I 407,15:
brahmanimantanika�teva, C [e] -MN I 774,32: brahmanimantanikanteva, S [e] -MN I 598,7: brahmanimantanikantveva) and [[MA78]] at T I 549a28: . According to Ps II
415,30, “Brahmā’s invitation” (Brahmanimanta�ika) refers to the way Brahmā welcomed the Buddha
on arrival. The same sense seems to be reflected in [[MA78]] at T I 547a9, which uses the verb “to
invite”,, in its title and again at T I 547a19 and T I 547c3 in its description of how Brahmā welcomed the Buddha. Horner 1954/1967: 395, however, understands the expression Brahmanimanta�ika
to have the sense of an “invitation to Brahmā”, perhaps taking brahmuno (in the concluding sentence)
to be dative rather than genitive. Yet, to indicate the sense of an invitation ‘to’ Brahmā, the object of
such an invitation should stand in the accusative, cf., e.g., Wijesekera 1993: 43: “with verbs of asking,
begging ... etc. the person asked ... is denoted by the accusative”. Neumann 1896/1995: 356 translates
the discourse’s title as “Brahmā’s visitation” (“Brahmās Heimsuchung”) and Chalmers 1926: 234 as
“Brahmā’s appeal”; cf. also Gombrich 2001: 106. 是為梵天請 ... 是故此經名梵天請佛
144 Gombrich 2001: 98 points out that a comparable belief in the Brahmā world as the ultimate is reflected
in the B�hadāra�yaka Upani�ad 6.2.15.
145 The parallel is [[MA78]] at T I 547a-549b, which agrees with [[MN49]] on the location and has the closely 請
similar title “discourse on Brahmā’s invitation to the Buddha”, . On [[MA78]] cf. also Minh
Chau 1964/1991: 58 and 184-185. According to [[MN49]] at MN I 326,5, the Buddha’s encounter with
Brahmā took place at a time when the Buddha was staying at Ukka��hā in the Subhaga Grove. Bodhi in
Ñā�amoli 1995/2005: 1246 note 499 points out that [[MN1]] takes place at the same location and has a
subject matter similar to [[MN49]] so that [[MN49]] can be seen “as a dramatic representation of the same
ideas set forth by the Mūlapariyāya in abstract philosophical terms”. For a discourse quotation in Abhidh-k-� cf. below note 155.
146 [[SN6.4]] at SN I 142-144 (or [[SN2]] 175 at [[SN2]] I 310-314), which agrees with [[MN49]] on the location. The
subject matter of this discourse recurs also in the Bakajātaka, Jā 405 at Jā III 358,20.
147 According to [[MN49]] at MN I 326,17, Brahmā welcomed the Buddha by saying that it had been a long

of greeting not recorded in [[MA78]] This greeting appears to be a polite expression of welcome that can
be used even if the visitor is coming for the first time. A similar case can be seen when Mahāmoggallāna visits Sakka, a visit which, judging from the fact that Sakka takes him for a tour of the heavenly

On arrival in the Brahmā realm, the Buddha told Brahmā that his eternalist view was
mistaken. The Bakabrahma-sutta of the Sa�yutta-nikāya continues at this point with a
verse exchange between the Buddha and Brahmā, in the course of which the Buddha
explains the past meritorious deeds that had led this Brahmā to his present position,
after which this version ends. [148]
According to the Brahmanimanta�ika-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel, at
this point Māra appeared on the scene, warning the Buddha that he should not contradict the word of Brahmā. Māra explained that recluses and Brahmins, who had developed disgust towards earth, water, fire, wind, the devas, Pajāpati, or Brahmā, [149] had on
that account been reborn in a lower realm. However, recluses and Brahmins who rejoiced in earth, water, fire, wind, the devas, Pajāpati, or Brahmā, had been reborn in a
superior realm.
The Buddha immediately recognized the speaker to be Māra, who according to the
Madhyama-āgama version pretended to be a member of Brahmā’s assembly. [150] According to the Majjhima-nikāya version, however, Māra had taken possession of a
member of Brahmā’s assembly. [151] This is remarkable, for although the discourses
attribute power to Māra in relation to the sensuous sphere, in the thought-world of
early Buddhism the jhānas and therewith the corresponding realms of the Brahmā
world appear to be outside of his control. [152] Thus it is already unexpected that he is


place and that Sakka’s maidens do not know Mahāmoggallāna, appears to have been his first visit to
Sakka’s realm. Nevertheless, according to [[MN37]] at MN I 252,25 and [[EA19.3]] at T II 594a6 Sakka
welcomes Mahāmoggallāna by saying that it had been a long time since he had visited (another parallel, [[SA505]] at T II 133c5, does not record such a greeting). Another case is what appears to be the Buddha’s first visit to Uruvilvākāśyapa, who according to the Catu�pari�at-sūtra fragments [[SN360]] folio
84V3 and [[SN365]]V6 in Waldschmidt 1952: 11 and 46 (cf. also Gnoli 1977: 217,18) welcomes the Buddha by saying that it had been a long time since the Buddha had come for a visit (Vin I 24,20 does not
report such a greeting). Another difference between [[MN49]] and [[MA78]] in regard to the present passage
is that, according to [[MN49]] at MN I 326,17, Brahmā addressed the Buddha as mārisa, “sir”, a mode of
address often used in the discourses by gods to address each other or the Buddha (cf. also Wagle 1985:
73). According to [[MA78]] at T I 547a19, however, Brahmā rather addressed the Buddha as “great seer”,
.
148 In his account of Brahmā’s past lives, according to [[SN6.4]] at SN I 144,1 (or [[SN2]] 175 at [[SN2]] I 313,11)
the Buddha also mentions a time when he had been a pupil of this Brahmā, a past life experience described in more detail in Jā 346 at Jā III 143,4.
149 Gombrich 2001: 99 comments that this listing “summarizes, from bottom to top, the world Brahmā has
created, and Māra is urging a positive attitude to both the creator and his creation”.
150 [[MA78]] at T I 547b24: “Māra, the Evil One, who was not Brahmā, nor a member of Brahmā’s assembly,
nevertheless claimed of himself: ‘I am a Brahmā’”,
. An extract from the present discussion already appeared in Anālayo 2005b: 12.
151 [[MN49]] at MN I 326,34: “Māra, the Evil One, had taken possession of a member of Brahmā’s assembly”,
大仙人 māro pāpimā aññatara� brahmapārisajja� anvāvisitvā.
152 According to [[MN25]] at MN I 159,10 and its parallel [[MA178]] at T I 720a9, as well as according to [[AN9.39]] at AN IV 434,1, the jhānas are beyond the reach of Māra. Notably, however, his realm appears to
be just bordering on the Brahmā world, as according to Ps I 34,2 Māra lives in the paranimmittavasavattidevaloka, where he governs his own following like a rebel prince in the border region of a king魔波旬非是梵天, 亦非梵天眷屬, 然自稱說, 我是

able to reach and manifest himself in the Brahmā world. According to the Brahmanimanta�ika-sutta, however, he not only took possession of a member of Brahmā’s assembly, but had even taken control over Brahmā himself, together with the whole of
the assembly. [153] This presentation stands in contrast to the range of Māra’s power and
influence described in other discourses.

MN I 327 Both versions report that Brahmā reaffirmed his eternalist view and informed the
Buddha that whoever delights in the four elements, in devas, in Pajāpati, or in Brahmā
will come under his control. The Buddha replied that he knew this to be the case, but
he also knew Brahmā’s past and his future destiny. [154]

MN I 328   According to the Brahmanimanta�ika-sutta and its parallel, the Buddha described the
reach of Brahmā’s power, followed by referring to heavenly realms he knew, but of
which Brahmā was unaware, thereby clarifying that in respect to knowledge Brahmā
was not his equal. [155]

MN I 329   According to the Majjhima-nikāya account, Brahmā had forgotten about his former
life, as this took place long ago, [156] an explanation not found in the Madhyama-āgama
version. This explanation seems to be required in order to account for Brahmā’s mistaken view, which not only involves his ignorance of other higher heavenly realms, but
also his belief not to be subject to birth and death.
According to the Madhyama-āgama discourse, in reply to the Buddha’s claim to superior knowledge, Brahmā affirmed to have infinite knowledge, an affirmation not recorded in the Majjhima-nikāya version. In this affirmation, Brahmā proclaims to be
conscious of infinite elements, to have infinite knowledge, and infinite vision. [157] A ref

1975: 112 note 33 and Gombrich 1975a: 134. The commentarial gloss on the present passage, found at
Ps II 405,28, explains that Māra had only taken possession of a single member of Brahmā’s retinue, cf.
also Boyd 1975: 93 note 80. This does not seem to resolve the problem, since already for Māra to be able
to do that much would not fit the way his range of power is depicted in other discourses.
153 In [[MN49]] at MN I 327,30, the Buddha addresses Māra by acknowledging: “Evil One, Brahmā and Brahmā’s assembly ... have all gone under your power”, yo c’ eva, pāpima, brahmā yā ca brahmaparisā ...
sabbe va tava vasagatā (B [e] -MN I 403,4 and C [e] -MN I 766,29: vasa�gatā, S [e] -MN I 592,17: vasa�gatā
and without va before tava).
154 Following [[MA78]] at T I 548a8: “I know where you came from and where you are going to”,
. The version of the Buddha’s reply in [[MN49]] at MN I 328,25 instead indicates that
the Buddha knew Brahmā’s destiny and “splendour”, te aha�, brahme, gatiñ ca pajānāmi jutiñ ca pajānāmi. A variant for juti, listed in E [e] -MN I 557 and in C [e] -MN I 768 note 5, reads instead cuti, which in
view of the context and of the passage in [[MA78]] appears to be the preferable reading; cf. also Horner
1954/1967: 391 note 5, who comments that juti _“_ seems to be faulty for cuti”.
155 [[MN49]] at MN I 329,10 and [[MA78]] at T I 548a28. A counterpart to the description of the reach of Brahmā’s power has also been preserved as a discourse quotation in Śamathadeva’s commentary on the
Abhidharmakośabhā�ya, D (4094) mngon pa, ju 188b6-189a7 or Q (5595) tu 215b5-216a7; cf. also
Abhidh-k 3:96 in Pradhan 1967: 185,3, paralleling MN I 328,18, with the Chinese counterparts in T

157 According to [[MA78]] at T I 548b11, Brahmā proclaimed that “because I am conscious of infinite ele

erence to an ‘infinite consciousness’ occurs also in the Brahmanimanta�ika-sutta at a
later point, where the Pāli editions differ on whether this expression should be attributed to the Buddha or to Brahmā. [158]
The commentary attributes this stanza to the Buddha and explains it to be a reference
to Nirvā�a. [159] In the Majjhima-nikāya discourse, this stanza would indeed seem to fit
the Buddha better, as the Brahmanimanta�ika-sutta qualifies the infinite consciousness
to be “non-manifestative” (anidassana). [160] In the Madhyama-āgama version, however,
to be conscious of infinite elements is only an aspect of Brahmā’s claim to omniscience
and does not seem to be related to Nirvā�a.
The “infinite consciousness” recurs in a stanza in the Kevaddha-sutta and in its Chinese parallel, [161] explained by the Pāli commentary to be an allusion to Nirvā�a. [162] In
the case of the Kevaddha-sutta, the Pāli and Chinese versions agree in attributing this
expression to the Buddha.
In the Madhyama-āgama version, the Buddha replies to Brahmā’s claim to infinite
knowledge by pointing out that those, who consider earth (etc.) to be ‘I’ or ‘mine’, do not
truly know earth (etc.), as only those, who do not consider earth (etc.) in such a way, truly
know earth (etc.). [163] Such an explanation is not found in the Brahmanimanta�ika-sutta.

B [e] -MN I 405,8 attributes it to the Buddha, as in this edition the ananta� viññā�a� is preceded by concluding Brahmā’s speech with iti (as does a variant reading in E [e] -MN I 558); cf. also Bodhi in Ñā�amoli 1995/2005: 1249 note 512 and Gombrich 2001: 105.
159 Ps II 413,6.
160 According to Nakamura 1955: 78-79, however, the stanza reflects Upani�adic conceptions of consciousness as the ultimate principle, in which case it would also fit Brahmā.

162 Sv II 393,14. If the claim to being endowed with an infinite consciousness should indeed have been attributed to Brahmā in ancient India, as [[MA78]] and some editions of [[MN49]] suggest, then the reference
to the infinite consciousness in [[DN11]] and [[DA24]] could be seen as an instance of a recurring pattern in
the early discourses, where a particular expression is reinterpreted in accordance with Buddhist teachings, a device Rhys Davids 1921: 132 refers to as “pouring new wine into the old bottles”. Hershock
2005: 4 speaks of “openly accommodating ... existing political, social and religious authorities” and
then focussing “on how they might be skilfully redirected”, expressive of a “general strategy of accepting, but then pointedly revising the meaning 識無形, 無量, 自有光 ” of contemporary conceptions. Behind this feature stands
a particular mode of thought in India, which approaches rival views and proposals in a spirit of “inclusivism” by incorporating central elements of another religious group and treating them as if these were
identical with one’s own position, while at the same time explicitly or implicitly indicating that these
rival elements are in some way inferior to one’s own system, cf. also Hacker 1983, Mertens 2004, the
articles collected in Oberhammer 1983, Ruegg 2008: 97-99, and Schmithausen 2005a: 171.
163 According to [[MA78]] at T I 548b14, recluses and Brahmins who in regard to earth have the idea that “‘I


298   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


The Madhyama-āgama discourse reports that the Buddha affirmed that he really
knew earth, since he did not consider earth (etc.) to be ‘I’ or ‘mine’. A parallel to this
statement occurs in the Brahmanimanta�ika-sutta, according to which the Buddha similarly proclaimed that he did not claim earth (etc.) to be ‘mine’.
On reading this passage in the Brahmanimanta�ika-sutta, it is not entirely clear why
the Buddha should at this point proclaim that he did not consider earth, etc., to be ‘mine’.
In the Madhyama-āgama version the progression of thought is smoother, since here
Brahmā had just affirmed his superior knowledge in regard to earth (etc.), an affirmation that came as a reply to the Buddha’s disclosure of heavenly realms unknown to
Brahmā. The Buddha then counters Brahmā’s presumption to have superior knowledge
by highlighting that true knowledge requires going beyond the notions ‘I’ and ‘mine’.
By declaring that he belongs to those who truly know, the Buddha implicitly indicates
that Brahmā does not truly know, because of being under the influence of notions of ‘I’
and ‘mine’.
In the Brahmanimanta�ika-sutta, the Buddha explains that he does not claim to be
“earth”, to be “in earth”, or to be “from earth”, and thereby does not take earth to be
“mine”. [164] This analysis of the process of appropriating different elements of experience and identifying with them is not found in the Madhyama-āgama parallel.

MN I 330   According to the Madhyama-āgama account, Brahmā proclaimed that all beings delight in existence, whereas the Buddha was uprooting existence. This proclamation
seems to intend to criticize the Buddha. In reply, the Buddha affirmed his lack of interest in existence. [165]
A similar stanza occurs at a later point in the Majjhima-nikāya version, after the Buddha had vanished from the sight of Brahmā. [166] Judging from the Madhyama-āgama dis

164 [[MN49]] at MN I 329,14, a presentation that brings to mind the Tathāgata’s aloofness from conceivings
described in [[MN1]] at MN I 5,35.
165 [[MA78]] at T I 548c2: “seeing fear in becoming, and seeing no fear in non-becoming, therefore one should
not delight in becoming, becoming       - why should it not be eradicated”,
? The way [[MA78]] introduces this statement could give the impression that it was
spoken by Brahmā. The context, however, suggest this to be improbable, since for Brahmā to make such
a statement would not fit the flow of the narration. That this statement should be attributed to the Buddha would also be supported by the fact that [[MN49]] at MN I 330,13 attributes a similar statement to him
(cf. note 166 below).
166 [[MN49]] at MN I 330, 地是我, 13 地是我所, : “having seen fear in existence, and seeing existence about to come to an end, I 我是地所, 彼計地是我已, 便不知地

and S [e] -MN I 596,19: kiñci, S [e] also: upādiyan ti). For vibhavesina� in this stanza cf. Norman 1995: 205,
who in his note on Th 527 suggests taking vibhavesina� in the present context as a future active parti- 於有見恐怖, 無有見不懼, 是故

2001: 105 as [having seen] “how those who seek non-becoming still become”, Horner 1954/1967: 393
as “becoming seeking dis-becoming” (taking ºesin in vibhavesina� in the sense of “seeking”), and Ñā�amoli 1995/2005: 428 as “being will cease to be”; cf. also Udāna-(varga) 29.22 in Bernhard 1965: 377.


Chapter 5 Cū�ayamaka-vagga                                   -  299


course, the rationale for this stanza is to rebut Brahmā’s affirmation of existence as
something that should be delighted in.
The Brahmanimanta�ika-sutta and its parallel record that at this point of their discussion Brahmā unsuccessfully attempted to vanish from the Buddha’s sight. According to
the Madhyama-āgama version, the Buddha was able to point out to Brahmā “now you
are here, now you are there”. [167] Both versions report that the Buddha then successfully
vanished from Brahmā’s sight. According to the Madhyama-āgama discourse, he accomplished this feat by emanating rays of light, so that Brahmā and his assembly could
no longer see him, although they could still hear him. [168 ]

While according to the Majjhima-nikāya version the Buddha at this point proclaimed
his lack of interest in existence in verse, according to the Madhyama-āgama account he
did not say anything while being invisible. Here the Majjhima-nikāya version fits the
flow of the narration better, since according to both versions the Buddha had decided
to perform a supernormal feat in such a way that he would disappear visually but could
still be heard by Brahmā and his assembly, a point which would be meaningless if,
once invisible, he were to remain silent.
The two versions note that Brahmā and his assembly were struck with wonder, after
which Māra reappeared on the scene, urging the Buddha to refrain from teaching disciples, as such teaching activities would result in an unfavourable rebirth. [169] Both versions reveal the real motivation behind this intervention by Māra to be his apprehension that the Buddha’s disciples will escape his power if the Buddha teaches the Dharma to them.
According to the Brahmanimanta�ika-sutta, the Buddha clarified that teaching activities could result in an unfavourable rebirth only in the case of teachers who are not
fully awakened. [170] The Madhyama-āgama version makes a similar statement, explaining that those who develop attachment to their disciples cannot really be reckoned to be

[true] recluses, [true] Brahmins, arahants, or fully awakened ones. [171]
In the Majjhima-nikāya account, the Buddha points out that, whether he should teach
or not, he remains “such”, [172] followed by explaining that he remains “such” because he
has abandoned all influxes, comparable to a palm tree cut off at the root.
The Madhyama-āgama discourse instead reports that the Buddha told Māra to keep
away from the issue whether the Buddha should teach or not, since the Buddha knew
well enough himself when that was suitable and when it was not appropriate. [173]

sāvakesu, stand in the locative case, so that the phrase seems to intend craving in relation to the disciples, not craving that takes place in the disciples themselves. This understanding is confirmed by [[MA78]] at T I 548c26, which enjoins: “don’t be attached to disciples”, .

[[MN50]] Māratajjanīya-sutta

The Māratajjanīya-sutta, the “discourse on a rebuke to Māra”, reports how Mahāmoggallāna rebuked Māra for harassing him. This discourse has three Chinese parallels,
one of which occurs in the Madhyama-āgama, while the other two are individual translations. [174] Counterparts to several sections of the present discourse have also been preserved in Sanskrit fragments and in a discourse quotation in Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya, extant in Tibetan. [175] Two partial parallels in the
Ekottarika-āgama have preserved narrations that correspond to sections of the Māratajjanīya-sutta. [176]

MN I 332  The Māratajjanīya-sutta and its three Chinese parallels report in similar terms that
Māra had entered into the belly of Mahāmoggallāna, but was quickly recognized by
Mahāmoggallāna and told to leave. Mahāmoggallāna then narrated that he had also
been a Māra in a past life, at the time of the Buddha Kakusandha. [177]

241 does not include T 67 in a provisional list of the authentic translations by Zhī Qīan. [[MA131]] agrees
with the Pāli version on locating the discourse in the Bhaggā country, while the individual translations
take place among the Vajjians. For a remark on [[MA131]] cf. Minh Chau 1964/1991: 37.

As part of their narration of events at the time of the Buddha Kakusandha, the Pāli
and Chinese versions relate how Sañjīva, one of the two chief disciples of this Buddha,
on one occasion entered the attainment of cessation. [178] Some cowherds mistook him for
being dead and set him on fire in order to cremate him, which he, however, survived
unharmed. [179] This tale of Sañjīva surviving his own cremation recurs also as part of a
discourse in the Ekottarika-āgama. [180]

qualification Pāpimā was rendered into Chinese cf. Nakamura 2000a: 439 and Pelliot 1933.
178 A discourse quotation in Abhidh-k-� at D (4094) mngon pa, ju 75b4 or Q (5595) tu 85a8 parallels the
description of Sañjīva’s attainment of cessation and subsequent cremation at MN I 333-334, differing
in so far as here the past Buddha is Vipaśyī, rnam par gzigs; cf. also Abhidh-k 2:45 in Pradhan 1967:
75,3, paralleling MN I 333,19, with its Chinese counterparts in T 1558 at T XXIX 26c21 and T 1559 at
T XXIX 185a27. T 67 at T I 867a28 differs from the other versions in as much as it does not explicitly
refer to cessation, but only reports that Sañjīva was in a “concentration attainment”, (introduced as, where Kuan 2007: 191 note 24, in relation to an occurrence of the similar expression in another discourse as a qualification of explains that this expression is probably a literal rendering of a phrase similar to the Pāli tathārūpa).
179 [[MN50]] at MN I 333,36 explains that this was how Sañjīva came to be given his name, since when the
cowherds the next day saw him alive, they thought that he had been “resurrected”, pa�isañjīvita. The
translators of [[MA131]] and T 67 were apparently not aware of this word play on pa�isañjīvita and sañjīva, since [[MA131]] at T I 620c12 renders his name by, “perception”, and T 67 at T I 867a24 by,
“knowing perception”, apparently taking the name Sañjīva or Sa�jīva to be related to saññā or sa�jñā.
The translator of T 66 at T I 864c8 took the safer road of transcribing Sañjīva with, which he then
explains at T I 865a4 to mean “born again”,, a gloss which indicates that he was aware of the im- 三昧正受
plications of the name Sañjīva. On renditions of the same name in the Chinese parallels to the 如其色像 Mahāpadāna-sutta 如其像 cf. Waldschmidt 1956: 171. D (4094) mngon pa, ju 定, 75b4 or Q (5595) tu 85a8 combines both
senses, as it gives his name as ’tsho byed dang mkhas pa, although this is followed by referring to him
just as ’tsho byed, corresponding to jīvaka.
180 [[EA48.6]] at T II 793b21 differs in so far as Sañjīva did not attain cessation, but rather, an expression for which Hirakawa 1997: 1180 gives vajropama-samādhi and vajra-samādhi as equivalents
(for the former cf. also Mahāvyutpatti no. 560 in Sakaki 1926: 44). The 想 recurs in [[EA48.6]] at 知想
T II 793a13, which, as noted by Lancaster 1976: 201, is one of several peculiar samādhis mentioned in
this collection. [[EA48.6]] describes how Sāriputta was seated in and remained unhurt when hit 薩若
by a yakkha on the head, an account similar to the story found in [[UD4.4]] at [[UD39]] 還生 20. The commentary
Ud-[[AN245.5]] records various opinions on the meditative attainment Sāriputta had entered when he was
hit by the yakkha, one of which is that he had attained cessation. Thus, perhaps the in [[EA48.6]] also intends the attainment of cessation. In the Sarvāstivāda tradition, the vajropama-samādhi
stands specifically for the complete cutting off of defilements, cf., e.g., Abhidh-k 6:44 in Pradhan 1967:
364,14; cf. also Frauwallner 1971a: 85. In a survey of related references (for additional references cf. 金剛三昧
Ruegg 1989: 167 note 336), de La Vallée Poussin 1925/1980: 227 note 3 points out that Pp 30,20 uses
the expression vajirūpamacitta to qualify an arahant’s freedom from the influxes, which the 金剛三昧 Puggala金剛三昧

MN I 334  According to the Māratajjanīya-sutta and its three Chinese parallels, in his former existence as a Māra, Mahāmoggallāna had tried to harass the monk disciples of Kakusandha Buddha by instigating the householders to revile and abuse the monks.
A similar tale is also found in another discourse in the Ekottarika-āgama, which differs in so far as here Māra influences the householders so that they do not give alms to
the monks. [181]
The Māratajjanīya-sutta reports that, in order to achieve his aim, Māra had “taken possession” of the householders. [182] According to the Chinese versions, however, he had
only instructed the householders to act according to his design. [183] The Māratajjanīyasutta and its three main Chinese parallels agree that the householders had to suffer
rebirth in hell for their conduct, a retribution for their evil conduct not recorded in the
partial parallel from the Ekottarika-āgama.
In the light of this retribution, the Pāli version’s proposition that Māra “took possession” of the householders is puzzling, since one would not expect the householders to
undergo the karmic retribution of rebirth in hell for something they had not done of
their own accord. [184]
The Māratajjanīya-sutta and its three full parallels depict the abuse poured by the
householders on the monks in similar terms, recording that the householders denigrated


paññatti then compares to a vajra that can break up any other gem or stone. In the Sarvāstivāda tradition, according to Dhammajoti 2002/2007: 439 the same image illustrates the vajrōpama-samādhi,
“whose strength (concentration) is comparable to that of a diamond that cuts through everything”. For a
definition of the vajropama-samādhi in the Yogācārabhūmi cf. Delhey 2009a: 204,1 and T 1579 at T
XXX 340b3 As already pointed out by Frauwallner 1971a: 96, the association between the arahant and
the vajra’s ability to break up any other gem or stone can already be found in [[AN5.28]] at AN I 124,20,
according to which the vajirūpamacitta puggala is one who has destroyed the influxes; cf. also Dhs
226,1. On the vajropama-samādhi in Mahāyāna literature cf. the survey in Pagel 2007: 15 note 17. Another tale of being burnt while seated in deep meditation can be found in T 211 at T IV 594c10, translated in Willemen 1999: 133, although in this case it is the Buddha himself who is mistaken for being
dead after sitting for seven days without moving, having “entered on the concentration on Nirvā�a”,
.
181 [[EA45.4]] at T II 772b10. The tale of events at the time of the former Buddha Kakusandha is preceded in
[[EA45.4]] at T II 772a26 with a narration according to which Māra had decided to prevent the Buddha
Gotama from receiving alms (for a similar tale cf. Dhp-a III 257,20), followed by the Buddha Gotama
relating events from the past to Māra.
182 [[MN50]] at MN I 334,11: anvāvisi.
183 According to [[MA131]] at T I 621a21 Māra “taught” the householders,, according to T 66 at T I
865a19 he “told” them,, according to T 67 at T I 867b14 he “converted” them to do his bidding,,
and according to [[EA45.4]] at T II 772b11 he “impelled” them, (for which Hirakawa 1997: 926 lists
codayati). An extract from the present discussion already appeared in Anālayo 2005b: 12-13. 入
184 The commentary, Ps II 418, 泥洹三昧 22, raises the same point and explains that what Māra did was to make the
householders believe that the monks were breaking their precepts and engaging in blameworthy conduct, so that the abuse poured on the monks was due to the householders’ own volitional decision,
therefore they had to reap the corresponding karmic results. Although this commentarial explanation
makes sense from the viewpoint of karmic retribution, it does not fit the terminology employed in the
discourse.

the meditation practice of the monks by comparing them to various predatory animals
that await an opportunity to catch a mouse or a fish (see table 5.7). [185]

According to the three main Chinese versions, the householders not only abused the
monks, but even went so far as to beat them with sticks, throw stones at them, and
destroy their requisites. When reborn in hell because of such wicked deeds, the householders realized that their evil rebirth was due to having maltreated the monks. [186] The
Pāli version neither reports that the householders went so far as to physically harm the
monks, nor does it record that they realized why they had been reborn in hell.
In view of the karmic retribution of rebirth in hell, it would make sense for the householders to be shown as having gone further than just ridiculing the meditation practice
of the monks, an act which, although certainly improper and unwholesome, might on
its own not warrant such heavy karmic retribution. [187] The Chinese version’s depiction

185 [[MN50]] at MN I 334,18. The last image used for such abuse in [[MN50]] at MN I 334,29 describes a donkey that stands by a doorpost. This image is not entirely clear, since one may wonder what the object of
the donkey’s “meditation” could be, as a donkey is not a predatory animal, unlike the other animals
mentioned before. [[MA131]] at T I 621a8, T 66 at T I 865a7, and T 67 at T I 867b13 provide the detail
required to fill out this image, as according to their description the object that occupies the donkey’s
mind at the end of a day of hard work, his “meditation object”, is fodder. The same idea recurs in [[AN11.10]] at AN V 323,8, which describes a horse “meditating” on fodder. Bollée 1988: 128 note 15 explains that it was apparently customary to let donkeys search for food themselves, instead of providing
them with fodder. Their chronic hunger, resulting from this situation, then became an object of popular
mocking; cf. also Gokhale 1980b: 451, who notes the humour underlying the similes in [[MN50]] The set
of four similes recurs in Nidd I 149,28 in a commentary on [[SNP4.7]] at [[SNP818]] A related image can be
found in the Jain work Sūyaga�[[AN1.11]].27-28 in Vaidya 1928: 51,9.
186 [[MA131]] at T I 621a29, T 66 at T I 865a28, and T 67 at T I 867c5.
187 In fact, according to [[AN6.46]] at AN III 355,6 some Buddhist monks disparaged other monks who were
meditating in a similar way, although without employing the similes used by the householders in [[MN50]] caricaturing the meditating monks in the following manner: “[proclaiming] ‘we are meditators, we
are meditators’ they meditate, they overmeditate. What do they meditate about? For what do they meditate? How do they meditate?”, jhāyino ’mhā jhāyino ’mhā ti jhāyanti, pajjhāyanti, ki� h’ ime jhāyanti,


304   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


of how the householders realized the dire consequences of harassing monks also seems
to fit the present discourse well, whose purpose is to impress upon Māra the dire consequences of harassing a monk.

MN I 335   According to the Māratajjanīya-sutta and its three main Chinese parallels, the Buddha Kakusandha told his monks to develop the brahmavihāras in order to face the
abuse they were experiencing. The partial parallel in the Ekottarika-āgama instead reports that he gave them a teaching on the true nature of nutriment. [188]
The Māratajjanīya-sutta and its three main parallels report that, once Māra realized
that he had been unable to get at the monks in this way, he decided to induce the householders to respect and venerate the monks instead. According to the partial parallel in
the Ekottarika-āgama, he got the householders to provide the monks with an abundance of material gains. [189]
While the Pāli discourse simply mentions that the householders honoured and revered the monks, the three main Chinese versions and a Sanskrit fragment parallel to
the present passage report that they went so far as to put their hair on the road, asking
the monks to step on it for the sake of good fortune. [190] The Māratajjanīya-sutta and its
main parallels agree that the householders were reborn in heaven as a result of their reverential behaviour, with the Chinese versions again noting that, when reborn in heaven,
the householders realized that their fortunate rebirth was due to their good conduct towards the monks.

MN I 336    The Māratajjanīya-sutta and its three main Chinese parallels differ on the instruction
given by the Buddha Kakusandha to his monks on this second occasion. [191] A compari
kint’ ime jhāyanti, katha� h’ ime jhāyanti? (B [e] -AN II 312,7 adds nijjhāyanti avajjhāyanti after pajjhāyanti and reads kim ime and katha� ime, S [e] -AN III 397,6: kiñ h’ ime and kathañ h’ ime). This description has several expressions in common with the way the householders abuse the monks in [[MN50]] at
MN I 334,16, caricaturing the meditating monk in this manner: “[proclaiming] ‘we are meditators, we
are meditators’, with dropping shoulders, downcast face and [having become] languid they meditate,
they overmeditate, they outmeditate, they mismeditate”, jhāyino ’sma jhāyino ’sma ti pattakkhandhā
adhomukhā madhurakajātā jhāyanti pajjhāyanti nijjhāyanti apajjhāyanti (B [e] -MN I 410,10 and S [e] -MN I
603,19: ’smā). Although the remainder of [[AN6.46]] makes it clear that such derisive criticism is not appropriate, there is no indication that it is of such unwholesome nature as to lead to rebirth in hell.
188 Cf. [[EA45.4]] at T II 772b14, which first lists the standard set of four types of nutriment (edible food, contact, intention, and consciousness), followed by setting forth five types of supramundane food, namely
absorption, resolution, mindfulness, the eight liberations, and joy.
189 [[EA45.4]] at T II 772b26.
190 [[MA131]] at T I 621c1, T 66 at T I 865b29, T 67 at T I 867c15, and Waldschmidt 1976: 143. Such stepping on an item spread on the ground for good luck appears to have been a custom in ancient India, in
fact Vin II 129,15 records an allowance for monks to step on cloth when asked to do so by laity for the
sake of good fortune.
191 [[MN50]] at MN I 336,22 takes up the impure nature of the human body, the repulsive nature of food, the
absence of delight in the whole world, and the impermanent nature of all formations, asubhānupassī
kāye viharatha, āhāre pa�ikkūlasaññino, sabbaloke anabhiratasaññino, sabbasa�khāresu aniccānupassino (B [e] -MN I 412,18: asubhānupassino and anabhiratisaññino). [[MA131]] at T I 621c25 mentions contemplation of all formations as impermanent and subject to arising and passing away, as well as contemplation of dispassion, discarding, cessation, and giving up,
汝等當觀諸行無常, 觀興衰法, 觀無欲, 觀


Chapter 5 Cū�ayamaka-vagga                                   -  305


son of these four versions suggests contemplation of impermanence to be the central
aspect common to the instructions on how to confront excessive respect and worship.
The Māratajjanīya-sutta and its main parallels continue by reporting that, since Māra
had not been successful with this ruse, he eventually went so far as to physically harm
Vidhura, the other chief disciple of Kakusandha Buddha. As a result of this evil deed,
Māra immediately wound up in hell. [192] This part of the present discourse is no longer
found in the partial parallel in the Ekottarika-āgama. [193]
When narrating this event, the Pāli version speaks of Māra having “taken possession”
of a young boy, [194] while according to the three Chinese parallels he transformed himself into a young boy or man in order to attack Vidhura. [195] The verb used in the present
Pāli passage is the same as in the earlier instance when Māra “possessed” the householders, yet the earlier instance when Māra took possession resulted in the householders having to bear the karmic retribution, whereas in the present instance Māra himself
receives the karmic retribution. [196]
The idea of possession by Māra brings to mind the preceding discourse in the Majjhima-nikāya collection, the Brahmanimanta�ika-sutta, where according to the Pāli version Māra took possession of a member of Brahmā’s assembly, while the Chinese parallel does not attribute such powers to him.
The same idea of possession by Māra recurs again on two occasions in the Sa�yuttanikāya. One of these instances reports that he took possession of a deva and made it speak
a stanza in the presence of the Buddha, yet, according to the Sa�yukta-āgama parallel

. T 66 at T I 865c24 enjoins viewing all formations as abiding in impermanence and as
being eradicated, discarded, ceasing, appeased, and abiding in the sphere of appeasement,
. T 67 at T I 868a2 speaks of recollecting the
impermanent nature of all things, of avoiding greed and delight in regard to robes and food, and of [contemplating] dukkha, emptiness, and not-self, .
Since in the partial parallel [[EA45.4]] the issue at stake is the monks receiving material gains, the recommendation they get at T II 772c5 is on avoiding attachment. Hence this version does not bring in the
topic of impermanence.
192 A reference to this event can be found in the *Mahāvibhā�ā, T 1545 at T XXVII 654c17.
193 After reporting the instruction given by the Buddha Kakusandha to his monks regarding the avoiding of
捨離, attachment, [[EA45.4]] at T II 772c 觀滅, 觀斷 9 continues with the Buddha Gotama giving a similar instruction to his
monks. 當於一切行
194 e e
[[MN50]] at MN I 336, 見無常住, 當 見盡, 當見離, 33: aññatara� kumāra� anvāvisitvā 當見滅, 當見止, 當見止住處 (B -MN I 413,1 and S -MN I 607,17: kumāraka�).
195
[[MA131]] at T I 622a7, T 66 at T I 866a8, and T 67 at T I 868a 念諸萬物所在無常, 11 agree that Māra 雖著衣食莫以貪樂, “transformed 苦, 空, ”, 非身,
himself into the perpetrator of the action. D (4094) mngon pa, nyu 119a2 or Q (5595) tu 136a8, which
has preserved an extract from this passage, also does not report Māra taking possession of someone else.
196 The commentary, Ps II 420,26, explains that in the present instance Māra indeed took control over the
boy, whereas in relation to the earlier abuse the commentary at Ps II 418,22 suggests that Māra had not
really taken control over the householders. [[MN50]] at MN I 334,11 indeed indicates that Māra only told
the householders to abuse the monks, while the harming of Vidhura at MN I 336,34 is worded in such a
way as to indicate that Māra himself is the subject of the action. The expression used for his interference in both cases is, however, the same, in that he “took possession”, anvāvisati, of the householders
and the boy.

he did not take possession of the deva. [197] The other occurrence in the Sa�yutta-nikāya
describes how Māra took possession of householders in order to prevent the Buddha
from receiving alms, an instance where according to two Chinese parallels, found in
the Sa�yukta-āgama and the Ekottarika-āgama, he only told the householders not to
give alms to the Buddha, without taking possession of them. [198]
The famous passage in the Mahāparinibbāna-sutta, according to which Māra prevented Ānanda from requesting the Buddha to continue to live on, employs a different
type of terminology, since it speaks of Ānanda’s mind being “obsessed” by Māra. [199]
Nevertheless, here, too, the Chinese and Tibetan parallel versions make use of vocabulary that is milder in tone, indicating that Ānanda had been “blinded” or “confused” by
Māra. [200]
In sum, it seems that the Pāli discourses stand alone in attributing to Māra the ability
to take possession of someone and thereby make this person speak or act according to
his will. [201] While in the case of the Brahmanimanta�ika-sutta this presentation is at
odds with what can be gathered from other discourses on the range of Māra’s power
vis-à-vis Brahmā, the Māratajjanīya-sutta’s description of how Māra took possession
of humans creates some inconsistency in regard to the karmic retribution described in
the same discourse for the acts undertaken by these possessed beings.

MN I 337    The Māratajjanīya-sutta and its parallels continue by describing the hell in which the
former Māra was reborn in retribution for his mischief. [202] The Chinese versions note

197 [[SN2.30]] at SN I 67,1 (or [[SN2]] 111 at [[SN2]] I 154,7): māro pāpima ... devaputtam anvāvisitvā (Be-SN I
67,1, C [e] -SN I 128,6, and S [e] -SN I 96,15: devaputta�), while in [[SA1308]] at T II 359c19 Māra “manifested”,, as a deva to speak a stanza.
198 [[SN35.27]] at SN I 114,7 (or [[SN2]] 154 at [[SN2]] I 253,4): brāhma�agahapatikā mārena pāpimatā anvāvi��hā

199 [[DN16]] at DN II 103,14: mārena pariyu��hitacitto. The commentary, Sv II 555,19, explains that Māra
created frightening sights and sounds that disturbed Ānanda, something Māra was able to do because
Ānanda’s mind was not yet free from the vipallāsas; on the commentarial position regarding this event
cf. also the study by [[AN2000]]
200 The Sanskrit fragment TM 361 folio 165V2 in Waldschmidt 1950: 53 and the Divyāvadāna in Cowell
1886: 201,21 or in Vaidya 1999: 125,18 describe that Ānanda was “suffused” by Māra, sphu�o, a description that seems not too far from the idea of possession. The Tibetan counterpart in Waldschmidt
1951: 207, 著 14, however, indicates that Māra was “covering up” Ānanda, khebs pa, similarly [[DA2]] at T I
15b25 and T 6 at T I 180b20 speak of Ānanda being “covered up”, by Māra, which Weller 1939: 79
translates as “blinded” (“mit Blindheit 語 geschlagen”). According to another 告. individual translation and the
account in the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, Māra “confused” Ānanda, T 7 at T I 191b23: and T
1451 at T XXIV 387c17: . T 5 at T I 165a12, translated in Puini 1909: 36, differs from all these
versions by reporting that Māra entered Ānanda’s belly and made him actually request the Buddha to
enter parinibbāna.
201 The possibility of possession is also reflected in an allowance made in Vin I 203,1 to partake of raw
meat and blood in case of being possessed by a spirit, cf. also below p. 318 note 43.
202 [[MN50]] at MN I 337,15 specifies that Māra was reborn in hell in a human body with a fish’s head, a detail not mentioned in the Chinese versions. A discourse quotation paralleling Māra’s ending up in hell, reported in [[MN50]] at MN I 337,5, can be found in Abhidh-k 3:12 in Pradhan 1967: 123, 蔽, 2; cf. also T 1558
at T XXIX 45b7, T 1559 at T XXIX 202b2, and D (4094) mngon pa, ju 118b6 or Q (5595) tu 136a4.

that (present time) Māra was thoroughly frightened on hearing the misfortune that befell his uncle Māra for harassing the monk disciples of Kakusandha Buddha and for
harming his chief disciple. [203]
The Chinese versions agree with the Māratajjanīya-sutta that Mahāmoggallāna also
described some of his past deeds in verse, such as his shaking the Hall of Migāra’s
Mother and the palace of Sakka with his toe, and his visit to a Brahmā to check if the
latter had overcome his former eternalist belief. [204]
According to all versions, Mahāmoggallāna concluded his stanzas by illustrating the
karmic retribution for attacking the Buddha or his monk disciples with the image of a
fool who will be burnt by fire, even though the fire does not have any intention to burn
the fool. [205]


203 According to [[MA131]] at T I 622a25, Māra asked in verse for more details on this hell, whereas according to [[MN50]] at MN I 337,18 and T 66 at T I 866a23 a similar verse inquiring about the nature of this
hell was spoken by Mahāmoggallāna as a rhetorical question when beginning his description of this
hell. In T 67 at T I 868a26, this inquiry and the subsequent verses that describe the hell are spoken by
the Buddha, which does not seem to fit the context too well.
204 [[MA131]] at T I 622c3, T I 622c1, and T I 622c15. T 66 at T I 866b28, T I 866b26, and T I 866c11. T 67
does not describe these events as explicitly as the other versions, although T 67 at T I 868b15 and T I
868b29 does record Mahāmoggallāna shaking a palace with his toe and questioning Brahmā. Mahāmoggallāna’s shaking of the Hall of Migāra’s Mother is recorded in [[SN51.14]] at SN V 270,5, his shaking of Sakka’s palace in [[MN37]] at MN I 253,35, and his addressing Brahmā on the latter’s eternalist belief in [[SN6.5]] at SN I 145,23 (or SN [2] 176 at SN [2] I 316,12). The stanzas that depict these events in [[MN50]] recur at Th 1187-1208 (for further parallels cf. Franke 1912: 174-182), as part of a set of over sixty
stanzas attributed to Mahāmoggallāna. Ling 1962: 104 comments that “as the verses occur there [i.e. in
Th] independently of the story of Dūsin, it is possible that the present form of the story [i.e. in [[MN50]]]
was prefixed to them at a later stage, in the way that prose narrations have been prefixed to verses in
the Itivuttaka and Udāna, for instance”; on the relationship between verse and prose in the Udāna cf.
also, e.g., Anālayo 2009e.
205 Windisch 1895: 160 suggests that, since the title of the discourse is Māratajjaniya, the reading at Th
1208: atajjesi, according to which Mahāmoggallāna _“_ rebuked” Māra, seems preferable to MN I 338,29:
agha��esi, according to which he “chastened” Māra. The other Pāli editions, B [e] -MN I 415,9, C [e] -MN I
788,22, and S [e] -MN I 611,1, indeed read atajjesi. His suggestion receives further support from [[MA131]]
at T I 622c29, according to which Mahāmoggallāna _“_ scolded” Māra,, and from T 66 at T I 866c24,
according to which Mahāmoggallāna _“_ told” Māra, . T 67 at T I 868c16, however, indicates that Mahāmoggallāna _“_ subdued” Māra, .

[[MN51]] Kandaraka-sutta

The Kandaraka-sutta, the “discourse to Kandaraka _”_, examines four types of person,
namely those who:

 - torment themselves,

 - torment others,

 - torment both,

 - torment neither themselves nor others.
This discourse does not have a parallel in the Chinese Āgamas. Similar expositions of
these four types of person recur in other Pāli discourses, [1] however, as well as in Sanskrit fragments. [2]


[[MN52]] A��hakanāgara-sutta

The A��hakanāgara-sutta, the “discourse to [a man from] A��hakanāgara”, presents a
survey of several approaches to awakening. This discourse has a Pāli parallel in the section on the elevens in the A�guttara-nikāya and two Chinese parallels, one of which
occurs in the Madhyama-āgama, while the other is an individual translation. [3]


1 Expositions in brief can be found in [[DN33]] at DN III 232,21 and [[MN94]] at MN II 159,5, detailed exposition in [[MN60]] at MN I 411,28 and [[AN4.198]] at AN II 205,23.
2 Cf. especially the fragments of the Pudgala-sūtra in Melzer 2006: 306-329, which have preserved a complete exposition of these four types of person. Other relevant fragments are, e.g., SHT I 422 (pp. 189190, cf. also SHT X p. 409), SHT III 879 (pp. 128-129, cf. also SHT VIII p. 183), SHT III 996 (pp. 257258, cf. also SHT VI p. 221 and SHT X p. 417), SHT IV 165 folio 27 (pp. 200-203, cf. also SHT VI p.
212, SHT VII p. 240, and SHT X p. 403), SHT V 1153 (p. 152, cf. also SHT VIII p. 197), and SHT V
1359 (pp. 244-245, cf. also SHT X p. 427). SHT I 422 parallels the reference to tormenting oneself in
[[MN51]] at MN I 342,23, while SHT III 879 parallels the reference to tormenting others in [[MN51]] at MN I
343,21; cf. also SHT V 1153 for both. SHT III 996, SHT IV 165 folio 27, and SHT V 1359 describe
practices of self-mortification, such as found in [[MN51]] at MN I 343 and also in other similar passages,
e.g., in [[DN8]] at DN I 166,2, [[DN25]] at DN III 40,26, or [[AN5.134]] at AN I 295,8.
3 The parallels are [[AN11.17]] at AN V 342-347, [[MA217]] at T I 802a-c, and T 92 at T I 916a-917a. The
four versions agree on locating the discourse at Pā�aliputta. According to the information given in the
Taishō edition, T 92 was translated by Ān Shìgāo ( ). Zürcher 1991: 297, however, does not include this translation among the works that can with certainty be attributed to Ān Shìgāo. [[MN52]] and
[[MA217]] agree on the title A��hakanāgara/, while T 92 at T I 916a17 has the title “discourse spoken
by the Buddha to the householder Ten Limbs, a man from A��hakanāgara”, .
While the protagonist in [[MA217]] has the name, which would correspond to the Dasama mentioned
in [[MN52]] the protagonist of T 92 is instead, which rendered into Pāli would be Dasa�ga. E [e] and S [e]
do not give a title for [[AN11.17]] but refer to it at E [e] -AN V 358,31 and S [e] -AN V 390,19 in their respective
chapter uddānas as Dasama. In B [e] -AN III 542,25, the title of the discourse is A��hakanāgara-sutta and the
uddāna at B [e] -AN III 556,3 refers to it as A��hako. The Ceylonese edition wavers between these two op安世高

310   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


MN I 349   The Pāli versions begin by briefly reporting that the householder Dasama, who had
been in Pā�aliputta on some business, approached a monk in order to find out where
Ānanda was staying.
The introductory narration in the two Chinese versions offers additional details, explaining that the householder Dasama, who had earlier successfully conducted some
business and derived great profit from it, approached a group of monks. These taught
him the Dharma in various ways and were able to please him with their exposition. [4]
After having received their teachings and being pleased by them, Dasama inquired regarding the whereabouts of Ānanda.
Another difference is that the two Chinese discourses begin by noting that the Buddha had recently attained parinibbāna. The same is also implicit in the introductory
part of the Pāli versions, which do not mention the whereabouts of the Buddha. Usually discourses, even when spoken by disciples, begin by mentioning the location where
the Buddha was staying at that time.
The four versions agree that the householder Dasama asked Ānanda if there was one
way, taught by the Buddha, that leads to the destruction of the influxes. In reply, Ānanda described how liberation can be achieved through developing insight based on the
attainment of any out of the four jhānas, of the four brahmavihāras, or of the three immaterial spheres of boundless space, boundless consciousness, and nothingness.
The Chinese versions also include in this presentation the fourth immaterial attainment, the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. [5] The Pāli subcommentary
explains that Ānanda did not mention the attainment of neither-perception-nor-non-perception because it is too subtle an attainment for the development of insight. [6]
A discourse in the A�guttara-nikāya similarly confines the objects for the development of insight to the realm of perception, in line with the above commentarial expla

tions, as C [e] -AN VI 646,1 introduces the discourse as A��hakanāgara-sutta, but the uddāna at C [e] -AN VI
674,31 refers to it as Dasamo. For a remark on [[MA217]] cf. Minh Chau 1964/1991: 101. Barua 1971/
2003: 351 suggests that A��hakanāgara probably corresponds to “a village called Hathagaon on the Bāgmatī river”.
4 [[MA217]] at T I 802a20 and T 92 at T I 916a29 report that the householder was so delighted at the teachings received that for a little while he remained speechless, after which he inquired about Ānanda.
5 [[MA217]] at T I 802b27 and T 92 at T I 916c8. Maithrimurthi 1999: 97 note 136 comments that this reference to the fourth immaterial attainment was probably added mechanically.
6 Be-Ps-p� II 9 explains that the attainment of neither-perception-nor-non-perception was not included in
the present exposition because of the subtlety of the formations that still remain during its attainment,
which would make it too difficult for a disciple to contemplate it, nevasaññānāsaññāyatanadhammāna�
sa�khārāvasesasukhumabhāvappattatāya tattha sāvakāna� dukkaran ti. This principle appears to be
reflected in the fact that [[MN64]] at MN I 436,28 and its parallel [[MA205]] at T I 780a16 stop short at the
attainment of nothingness and do not mention the attainment of neither-perception-nor-non-perception in
a presentation that relates deep concentration experience to the development of insight; cf. also note 7
below. The same pattern would also apply to the corresponding realms of rebirth, since [[AN5.88]] at AN
I 267-268 describes how a noble disciple, on being reborn in one or the other immaterial realm, will attain final Nirvā�a there, a presentation which also does not include the realm of neither-perception-nornon-perception.


Chapter 6 Gahapati-vagga                                      -  311


nation that the attainment of neither-perception-nor-non-perception is not a suitable object for the development of insight. [7]
The Pāli and Chinese versions differ also in their description on how to develop insight in regard to this range of concentration experiences. According to the Majjhimanikāya and A�guttara-nikāya versions, each attainment should be contemplated as conditioned and impermanent. [8] The Madhyama-āgama version instead speaks of contemplating dharmas as dharmas. [9]
The Pāli and Chinese versions indicate that their respective approaches to insight
have the potential of leading to full awakening or to non-return. When describing the
lesser of these two alternatives, the A��hakanāgara-sutta and its A�guttara-nikāya
counterpart indicate that the attainment of non-return will be achieved due to the practitioner’s “lust for the Dharma”, dhammarāga. [10] The expression “lust for the Dharma”


7 [[AN9.36]] at AN IV 426,9: “as far as there is attainment of perception, to that extent there is penetrative
knowledge”, yāvatā saññāsamāpatti, tāvatā aññāpa�ivedho (cf. also [[SN14.11]] at SN II 151,1, which
similarly uses the term saññāsamāpatti only in regard to attainments up to the sphere of nothingness).
Schmithausen 1981: 224 notes 86 and 87 and ibid. p. 229 note 106 draws attention to similar statements
found in the Abhidharmasamuccaya in Pradhan 1950: 69,15: yāvad eva sa�jñāsamāpatti� tāvad ājñāprativedha iti and T 1602 at T XXXI 576c11: ; cf. also Ruegg 1989: 200.
The Yogācārabhūmi, T 1579 at T XXX 859a13, explains that, unlike the attainment of nothingness, the
attainment of neither-perception-nor-non-perception cannot be used as a path for the eradication of the
influxes, (for a similar statement cf. also T 1550 at T XXVIII 823b18), but
from the perspective of the development of insight can only be put to use for the purpose of developing
disenchantment with the sphere of nothingness. Cf. also, e.g., the discussion in the Dharmaskandha,
which describes the development of insight based on the jhānas and on the first three immaterial attainments, up to the sphere of nothingness, T 1537 at T XXVI 494a22. Gunaratana 2007: 65 sums up that, in
the case of the attainment of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, “the mental contents ... are so extremely refined and subtle that even the purest mindfulness and concentration cannot explore them”,
hence it “cannot be used as a basis for insight” 唯依有想三摩鉢底領解通達 . Schmithausen 1981: 224 note 87 points out that a discourse quotation in the Abhidharmakośavyākhyā (cf. Wogihara 1971b: 275,25), however, does include
the attainment of neither-perception-nor-non-perception among states that can be used for the development of insight; cf. also, e.g., [[SA870]] at T II 220b 非想非非想處, 無無漏道 7, which applies an insight contemplation that is based
on the aggregate analysis to all four immaterial attainments.
8 [[MN52]] at MN I 350,13: “this is conditioned and produced by volition, whatever is conditioned and produced by volition is impermanent and subject to cessation”, ida� ... abhisa�khata� abhisañcetayita�,
ya� kho pana kiñci abhisa�khata� abhisañcetayita� tad anicca� nirodhadhamman ti; cf. also [[AN11.17]] at AN V 343,22 and Hamilton 2000: 195.
9 [[MA217]] at T I 802b9: ; cf. also T 92 at T I 916b18, which appears to imply the same. The injunction to contemplate dharmas as dharmas occurs in the Satipa��hāna-sutta, where one of its implications is to contemplate arising and passing away, cf. [[MN10]] at MN I 60,30. To develop insight into the
impermanent nature of deep concentration experiences would indeed be a powerful method to develop
disenchantment towards such experiences. A problem with applying this to [[MA217]] however, is that
the Madhyama-āgama parallel to the Satipa��hāna-sutta, [[MA98]] at T I 584a14, does not mention contemplation of arising and passing away in its description of contemplating dharmas as dharmas.
10 [[MN52]] at MN I 350,17 and [[AN11.17]] at AN V 343,25: “by way of that lust for the Dharma and that desire for the Dharma ... he will be reborn spontaneously and attain final Nirvā�a there”, ten’ eva dhammarāgena tāya dhammanandiyā ... opapātiko hoti tattha parinibbāyī. Although the formulation reads as
觀法如法



MN I 350


312   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


occurs also in the Madhyama-āgama version. [11] The Madhyama-āgama version and the
individual translation speak, moreover, of “craving for the Dharma”. [12] The individual
translation relates such craving for the Dharma to developing the Dharma and to having reverence or regard for it. [13] Thus the expressions “lust for the Dharma”, or even
“craving for the Dharma”, have quite positive connotations in the present context. [14]

MN I 352  The A��hakanāgara-sutta and its parallels record that the householder Dasama was
delighted that Ānanda had shown eleven (or according to the Chinese versions twelve)
ways to liberation on being asked to point out just a single one. [15] By way of illustration,
he compared this to a man who is able to escape from a house on fire through any of
the eleven (or twelve) doors of the house. The four versions agree that the householder
expressed his appreciation by inviting the community of monks for a sumptuous meal


if dhammarāga is instrumental in assuring at least non-return, the commentary, Ps III 146,28, understands dhammarāga to represent attachment to one’s meditative experiences that has prevented the attainment of full awakening; cf. also Harvey 2003: 319, who in relation to the present occurrence of
dhammarāga comments that “spiritual desire may be what holds a person back from the highest attainment”, whereas Webster 2005a: 102 takes dhammarāga to be part of what “ultimately leads to nibbāna”.
11 [[MA217]] at T I 802b11: .
12 [[MA217]] at T I 802b11 and T 92 at T I 916b21: ; cf. also the Abhidharmakośavyākhyā in Wogihara
1971b: 273,25, which in a similar context reads tenaiva dharma-cchandena tenaiva dharma-snehena
tenaiva dharma-premnā tayaiva dharmābhiratāya.
13 T 92 at T I 916b21:,, ; cf. also the otherwise unrelated discourse [[SA866]]
at T II 219c21, where lust for the Dharma occurs together with recollecting the Dharma and delighting
in it as the qualities by virtue of which rebirth in the Brahmā realm takes place,
.
14 Although the term “lust”, rāga, may prima facie call up negative associations, even the term “craving”,
ta�hā, occurs in [[AN4.159]] at AN II 145,34 and its parallel [[SA564]] at T II 148b20 with positive connotations. Both propose that based on craving, craving can be overcome, 欲法 ta�ha� nissāya ta�hā pahātabbā
ti,, followed by explaining the first instance of craving to represent the wish to attain libera- 愛法
tion. In a similar vein, [[SN51.15]] at SN V 272,16 indicates that “desire”, chanda (another term which often carries negative connotations) is to be overcome with the help of chanda. Its parallel [[SA561]] at T II
147a19 makes the same point in slightly different terms, indicating that craving is to be overcome based 彼自愛法 彼自習法 彼自敬法
on desire, . Such instances highlight that in the early discourses terminology is not as uniform as in later texts. By the time of the Abhidharma and the commentaries, the implications of key ter- 即以此欲法, 念法, 樂法
minology are clearly delineated and terms such as 功德, 生大梵天中 “lust” and “craving” tend to be used only with a negative meaning. In the early discourses, however, such terms cannot be restricted to the meaning given to
them in later works and are at times employed in ways which may even seem to conflict with the definitions given in the Abhidharma and the commentaries.
15 While according to [[MN52]] at MN I 353, 依愛斷愛 3, Ce-MN II 26,4, and Se-MN II 22,19 the householder Dasama
was able to “hear” about eleven doors to the deathless, savanāya, according to B [e] -MN II 15,25 he was
able to “develop” them, bhāvanāya. Again, while in [[AN11.17]] at AN V 346,32 and B [e] -AN III 546,7 he
was able to “pursue” these eleven doors, sevanāya, in C [e] -AN VI 654,5 and S [e] -AN V 376,20 he was able
to “hear” of them, 依於欲而斷愛 savanāya. [[MA217]] at T I 802c9 describes that the householder was able to “attain a
safe emerging”, (my translation is based on another occurrence of the expression in
[[MA206]] at T I 781b14, where it forms the counterpart to sotthinā abhinibbhijjitu� in its parallel [[MN16]]
at MN I 104,10), in dependence on these doors to the deathless, while T 92 at T I 916c20 proclaims that
“relying on each of these doors to the deathless, each will lead out”,, .

the next day and by making the gift of a building to Ānanda. The Chinese discourses
note that Ānanda handed the building over to the Sa�gha of the four directions. [16]


[[MN53]] Sekha-sutta [17]
The Sekha-sutta, the “discourse on a disciple in higher training”, is an exposition by
Ānanda on the gradual path of training and on seven qualities of a disciple in higher
training. [18]
Of this discourse, so far no parallel appears to have been identified. [19] References to a
version of this discourse have, however, been preserved in the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā(upadeśa-)śāstra, [20] which thus indicates that a version of the present discourse was
known in other reciter traditions.


[[MN54]] Potaliya-sutta

The Potaliya-sutta, the “discourse to Potaliya”, clarifies what is required in order to
truly leave behind all worldly affairs. This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyamaāgama. [21] A few lines of this discourse have also been preserved in Sanskrit fragments. [22]
The Potaliya-sutta and its Chinese parallel report that Potaliya, who had come to
visit the Buddha, felt offended because the Buddha addressed him with the epithet

16 [[MA217]] at T I 802c24 and T 92 at T I 916c29.
17 Se-MN II 24,1 has the title Sekhapa�ipadā-sutta, corresponding even closer to the topic of [[MN53]]
18 A detailed exposition of these seven qualities can be found in [[AN7.63]] at AN IV 109,5; on the stanza
found at MN I 358,28 cf., e.g., Bühler 1897.
19 Akanuma 1929/1990: 166 lists [[SA1176]] at T II 316a as a parallel to [[MN53]] [[SA1176]] however, is rather
a parallel to [[SN35.202]] at SN IV 182-188, since in both these discourses Mahāmoggallāna contrasts a
monk who reacts to perceptual experience with likes and dislikes with a monk who is able to stay aloof
from such reactions. [[SN35.202]] and [[SA1176]] share with [[MN53]] the same introductory narration, which
describes how the Sakyans invited the Buddha to their newly built hall, how the Buddha then gave a talk
to them and, once the Sakyans had left, asked one of his disciples to continue instructing the monks. The
similarity of the introductory narration may have led Akanuma to assign [[SA1176]] as a parallel to [[MN53]] The two discourses differ, however, not only in regard to their subject matter, but also in regard to
their speaker, which in [[MN53]] is Ānanda, while in [[SA1176]] the speaker is Mahāmoggallāna.
20 Cf. T 1509 at T XXV 86b24, T XXV 173c4, and T XXV 249c23, identified in Lamotte 1944/1981: 244
note 1 to be from a version of the present discourse.
21 The parallel is [[MA203]] at T I 773a-775b, which agrees with the Pāli version on taking the name of its
protagonist as title, rendered as, p li [h] ta (following Pulleyblank 1991: 42, 85, and 188), which
compared to the Pāli version has the second and third syllables in the opposite order (and omits the last,
which, however, is a recurrent feature of Chinese renderings of proper names). [[MA203]] takes place in
Pāvārika’s Mango Grove near the town of Nā�andā, whereas [[MN54]] has the town Āpa�a in the country
of the A�guttarāpans as its location. For remarks on [[MA203]] cf. Minh Chau 1964/1991: 71.
22 The fragments are SHT V 1332a (p. 226), SHT VI 1493 (p. 161), and SHT X 3917 (p. 217), which correspond to the concluding part in [[MN54]] at MN I 368,1. The fragments continue with the beginning part
of [[MN26]] indicating that they had the same sequence as the Madhyama-āgama, where the parallel to
[[MN26]] ([[MA204]]) also follows the parallel to [[MN54]] ([[MA203]]).

“householder”. [23] The Madhyama-āgama version precedes this meeting by narrating
that Potaliya was in the habit of visiting recluses and Brahmins in parks and groves, informing them that he had left all worldly affairs behind, a statement that met with the
approval of these recluses and Brahmins. [24]
According to the Majjhima-nikāya and Madhyama-āgama versions, Potaliya felt that
he should not be called a householder, because he had left behind all worldly affairs,
having handed over his wealth to his children and living merely on what he needed to
subsist. [25] The Buddha, however, explained to Potaliya that leaving behind all worldly
affairs required more than that. Potaliya was keen to receive more explanations, according to the Madhyama-āgama version he even expressed his interest by discarding
his walking stick and sandals, followed by requesting the Buddha with hands joined in
respectful salutation to expatiate on the matter. [26]

MN I 360   According to both versions, the Buddha enumerated eight qualities that lead to leaving behind or cutting off worldly affairs (see table 6.1).


Table 6.1: Eight Qualities to be Left Behind According to [[MN54]] and its Parallel

|[[MN54]]|[[MA203]]|
|---|---|
|killing (1)<br>stealing (2)<br>speaking falsehood (3)<br>speaking maliciously (4)<br>greed (5)<br>scolding (6)<br>anger (7)<br>excessive pride (8)|killing (→ 1)<br>stealing (→ 2)<br>sexual misconduct<br>speaking falsehood (→ 3)<br>greed (→ 5)<br>anger (→ 7)<br>dislike and irritation<br>excessive pride (→ 8)<br>(≠ 4, 6)|



The two versions agree in including the need to refrain from killing, stealing, lying,
greed, anger, and excessive pride in this listing of requirements. While the Majjhimanikāya version lists speaking maliciously and scolding as the remaining two factors,
the Madhyama-āgama version has sexual misconduct as one factor and dislike together

24 [[MA203]] at T I 773a8. The same account recurs at the end of [[MA203]] at T I 775b13, when Potaliya describes how he earlier overestimated himself and rejoices in the Buddha’s exposition.
25 According to [[MN54]] at MN I 360,4, he referred to his condition as “having given up all work and cut off
all affairs”, sabbe kammantā pa�ikkhittā sabbe vohārā samucchinnā ti, while according to [[MA203]] at T

off worldly affairs”, . Bapat 1975: 28 notes the appropriateness of the rendering

with irritation as the other factor. [27] In regard to this difference, the absence of sexual
misconduct in the Pāli version is surprising, since this factor would fit an enumeration
that includes killing, stealing and falsehood, all the more since the later part of both
discourses takes up the dangers of sensuality in detail.
The two versions agree that the rationale for refraining from these unwholesome activities and qualities is to avoid blame and a bad reputation, as well as the prospect of
an evil rebirth. [28] Both versions indicate that, with this much accomplished, still more
needs to be done. By way of illustration, they deliver a series of similes on the disadvantages of sensuality (see table 6.2).
The two versions compare sensuality in similar terms to:

 - a dog that gnaws a meatless bone,

 - a bird that carries a piece of meat in the air and is attacked by other birds,

 - a burning torch held against the wind. [29]
The Majjhima-nikāya version next describes a man who is seized by two strong men
and dragged to a burning charcoal pit. [30] Its Madhyama-āgama parallel has a similar
image, without, however, mentioning an intervention by other men. Instead, it simply
indicates that the man would not want to fall into such a burning pit, since he wants to
live and wishes to avoid suffering. [31]

(Hirakawa 1997: 367 indicates that, besides its main meaning of ‘jealousy’, can also render pratighāta, which would fit the present context better).
28 While according to [[MA203]] at T I 773b7 the Buddha described these implications on his own accord,
according to [[MN54]] at MN I 360,20 at first he only enumerated the eight factors. Once Potaliya had requested a more detailed exposition, the Buddha explained the rationale for refraining from these eight
unwholesome activities and qualities.
29 The image of a bird that carries a piece of meat and is thereon attacked by other birds recurs again in Jā
408 at Jā III 378,16, where seeing the predicament of this bird causes a king to become thoroughly disenchanted with sensual pleasures, with the result that he achieved awakening as a Paccekabuddha (this
tale is part of a set of four tales on Paccekabuddhas common to the Buddhist and Jain traditions, on 邪婬 憎嫉惱
these tales cf., e.g., Charpentier 1908, Pavolini 1899, and Wiltshire 1990: 118-166). A variation on this 嫉
particular image occurs at Vin III 105,34 and in [[SN19.2]] at SN II 256,7, where the piece of meat itself
flies through the air and is pecked at by birds, a bizarre karmic retribution incurred by a butcher in retribution for his evil livelihood. The Chinese parallel to [[SN19.2]] [[SA509]] at T II 135c1, speaks instead of
a being who suffers agonizing pain, because its body is being eaten by hungry birds and other animals.
The piece of meat image recurs also in [[MN23]] at MN I 145,3, where it stands representative for lust and
delight; cf. also Jā 330 at Jā III 100,15. The simile of the burning torch occurs again at Thī 507, where it
illustrates sensual pleasures. For a parallel to the simile of the dog that gnaws a meatless bone in Jain
scripture cf. von Kamptz 1929: 24. Franke 1906: 345 notes a counterpart to the simile of the piece of
meat in the Mahābhārata, which describes an eagle who, being in possession of a piece of meat, is attacked by other eagles. For a study of the similes found in [[MN54]] cf. Hecker 2009: 132-136; cf. also

The Madhyama-āgama account continues after the simile of the burning charcoal pit
by delivering the simile of a poisonous snake, which describes a man who would not
wish any of his limbs to be bitten by this snake. [32] This simile does not occur in the Potaliya-sutta.
In regard to this difference, it is noteworthy that the Alagaddūpama-sutta and its
Madhyama-āgama parallel report that a group of monks quoted a series of similes as
having been taught by the Buddha on the disadvantages of sensual pleasures. This series not only contains the similes found in the Potaliya-sutta, but also the simile of the
snake, thereby lending some degree of support to its inclusion in the Madhyama-āgama
parallel to the Potaliya-sutta. [33]
The next simile in the Potaliya-sutta describes a man who, while being asleep and
dreaming, sees lovely parks and groves. The image of a dream occurs also in the Madh

ing charcoal image, the idea of being at the mercy of two strong men occurs when the point at stake is to
illustrate the pain experienced when being seriously ill or when engaging in forceful breath control, cf.
[[MN36]] at MN I 244,28, [[MN85]] at MN II 93,23, [[MN97]] at MN II 193,17, [[MN100]] at MN II 212,6, [[MN143]] at MN III 259,10, [[MN144]] at MN III 264,8, [[SN35.87]] at SN IV 56,29, and [[AN6.56]] at AN III 380,14.
Another occurrence is [[SN12.63]] at SN II 99,29, where the simile illustrates volition, apparently intended
to depict the inevitability of its karmic consequences. The image of two men who drag a third to a burning pit as an illustration of sensual pleasures can also be found in [[MN75]] at MN I 507,7 and its parallel
[[MA153]] at T I 672a6, where it occurs after an examination of the predicament of a leper who cauterises
his wounds over a burning pit. Here the point of the simile is to indicate that, once this leper has been
healed, he would not want to come near the pit even if dragged there by force. Another instance where
the same simile is used to illustrate sensual pleasures is [[SN35.203]] at SN IV 188,25. Its Chinese parallel,
[[SA1173]] at T II 314a17, only describes how someone would want to avoid falling into such a burning
pit, without mentioning any intervention by others.
32 [[MA203]] at T I 774b29, cf. the translation in Ehara 1961/1995: 74 note 1.
33 [[MN22]] at MN I 130,29 speaks of the simile of a “snake’s head”, sappasirūpamā, while its parallel [[MA200]] at T I 763c20 speaks of a “poisonous snake”,, using the same term as [[MA203]] at T I 774b29.
The simile of a snake’s head recurs in [[SN35.1]] at [[SNP768]] again as an illustration of the dangers of sensuality, cf. also above p. 148 note 17. In the context of a similar set of similes, SĀ [2] 185 at T II 440a6
refers to something that is poisonous and stings, which could be a reference to the snake imagery,
although the passage is ambiguous: “sensual desires are like faeces and poison, they sting and pollute”,

yama-āgama parallel, which, however, depicts how this man dreams of the five types
of sensual pleasure. [34]
The final two similes in both versions describe in similar terms how someone may
show off with borrowed goods and how a man is in danger if, after he has climbed up a
fruit tree to eat some of the fruits, another man comes and starts to cut down this tree in
order to get its fruits. [35]
The two versions agree in concluding each simile with a description of how a noble
disciple realizes the disadvantages of sensual pleasures and goes beyond them. The
Majjhima-nikāya version stands alone in describing that the noble disciple avoids diversified equanimity and instead develops unified equanimity. [36]
According to the commentarial explanation, such unified equanimity refers to the
equanimity of the fourth jhāna. [37] The attainment of the fourth jhāna would fit the present instance well, since the Potaliya-sutta continues at this point with the three higher
knowledges, whose development presupposes the four jhānas.
The same can also be seen in the Madhyama-āgama version, which after the final
simile explicitly mentions the development of the four jhānas. [38] The Madyhama-āgama account continues after the four jhānas directly with the destruction of the influxes, [39]
thereby not mentioning the first two higher knowledges included in the Majjhimanikāya account. [40]
According to both versions, Potaliya admitted that his claim to having left all worldliness behind had been an overestimation, followed by taking refuge. The Madhyamaāgama account adds that, by the end of the Buddha’s discourse, Potaliya had become a
stream-enterer. [41]


34 [[MA203]] at T I 774c13: . The image of waking up from a dream recurs in [[SN35.13]] at
[[SNP807]] where it illustrates the separation from dear ones that have passed away and are not seen any
more, just like things seen during a dream.
35 The simile of climbing a fruit tree that is being cut down occurs also in the Jain Isibhāsiyāi� 24.32,
Schubring 1969: 526: chijja� va tarum ārū�hā phal’ atthī va jahā narā.

37 Ps III 43,13. This commentarial gloss finds support in [[MN137]] at MN III 220,27, where the same expression upe(k)khā ekattā ekattasitā refers to the equanimity experienced during the four immaterial attainments (attainments that are developed based on the concentrative strength of the fourth jhāna).
38 [[MA203]] at T I 775a21 refers to the first 夢得具足五欲自娛 jhāna only by way of its first two factors,, corresponding to vitakka and vicāra, after which it has a full description of the other three jhānas. The reference to the factors of the first jhāna in this instance could in principle also be a corrupted version of the
beginning formula for the second jhāna, which begins with the overcoming of these two, in which case
this passage would proceed directly from the overcoming of sensual desires to the second jhāna. As the
overcoming of sensual desires precedes the first jhāna, however, which is already aloof from such desires, it seems more probable that the present passage’s mentioning of is rather a remnant of a
reference to the first jhāna.

[[MN55]] Jīvaka-sutta

The Jīvaka-sutta, the “discourse to Jīvaka”, records a meeting between the Buddha
and the physician Jīvaka during which the Buddha clarified under which conditions it
is allowable for monks to partake of meat. This discourse does not have a parallel in
the Chinese Āgamas.
The absence of a parallel has been taken to be related to its content, in the sense that
an attitude against meat eating, presumably prevalent among Sarvāstivādins, could be
responsible for the lack of a version of the present discourse in the Madhyama-āgama. [42]
Further investigation, however, shows that the Sarvāstivāda Vinaya preserves the same
regulation on consumption of meat as found in the Jīvaka-sutta. [43] Once this regulation
is found in the Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, there would be little need for the Sarvāstivādins to
expunge this discourse from what appears to be a collection transmitted by them.
In fact, although the Jīvaka-sutta does not have a Chinese Āgama parallel, Sanskrit
fragments of a parallel to the Jīvaka-sutta have been found in the recently discovered
(Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Dīrgha-āgama. [44] Hence the absence of a parallel to the Jīvakasutta among the discourses found in the Chinese Āgamas is not due to ideological is

42 Minh Chau 1964/1991: 31 suggests that: “the dropping from all the Chinese Āgamas of the Pāli sutta No
55, Jīvakasutta, in which the Buddha was reported to allow the monks to take three kinds of meat, confirms the Sarvāstivadin’s attitude against meat-eating”; an extract from the present discussion already
appeared in Anālayo 2008a: 6-7.
43 T 1435 at T XXIII 190b9 and T XXIII 264c27, being the counterpart to [[MN55]] at MN I 369,4; cf. also T
1435 at T XXIII 91b21, which includes meat and fish in a listing of allowable food, thereby clearly not
taking a vegetarian stance. T 1435 at T XXIII 190b14 agrees with Vin I 238,8 on reckoning meat consumption apart from the forbidden three instances as “pure”,, tiko�iparisuddha. Schmithausen
2005b: 189 note 24 suggests to understand such purity “in the sense of the Jaina idea of purity ... where
‘pure’ (suddha) contrasts with uddesiya (‘prepared particularly for the ascetic’), etc., and clearly means
‘free from any contamination with hi�sa, i.e. killing or injuring”. Even the (Mahāyāna) Mahāparinirvā�a-mahāsūtra (on the title of this work cf. Habata 2007: xliii-li), according to which the Buddha enjoined a vegetarian diet (since to consume meat will be obstructive to the development of loving kindness, cf. T 374 at T XII 386a15: ), refers to the regulation on the three allowable instances of consuming meat, a regulation found also in the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya in Dutt 1984a:
236,17 and in T 1458 at T XXIV 570a15. A study of this regulation in the light of different Vinayas can
be found in Prasad 1979; cf. also Heirman 2006: 60. Waldschmidt 1939/1967: 105 notes that in the
older texts there is no trace of a ruling against partaking of meat. An injunction against eating (raw?) 三種淨
meat can be found in the Mahāvastu in Senart 1897: 265,14, where a newly ordained monk is told: “you
have to abstain from red meat”, mānsaśo�ita� te ... parityajitavya� (Basak 1968/2004: 158,33: mā�saśo�ita�). To abstain from accepting raw meat forms part of the general description of moral conduct in
the Pāli discourses, cf., e.g., [[MN27]] at MN I 180,10. Vin I 203,1 allows the consumption of raw meat in
case of affliction by a non-human, i.e., possession by an evil spirit, on which cf. also Zysk 1991: 87; for
parallels in other Vinayas cf. Frauwallner 1956: 93. 食肉者, 斷大慈種
44 Hartmann 2004b: 127 indicates that this fragment ranges from folio 433r2 to 435r5 of the newly discovered Dīrgha-āgama fragment (I am indebted to Jens-Uwe Hartmann for kindly providing me with a
preliminary draft transliteration of this fragment); for a reference to this parallel version in an uddāna of
this collection cf. also Hartmann 2002a: 138. Another fragment parallel to [[MN55]] is SHT VI 1525V1R2 (p. 174, identified in SHT IX p. 421; cf. also SHT VIII p. 207).


Chapter 6 Gahapati-vagga                                      -  319


sues, but is rather an outcome of the circumstance that the four Āgamas extant in Chinese translation belong to different schools.
Although the Dīrgha-āgama preserved in Chinese, which appears to belong to the
Dharmaguptaka tradition, does not include a version of the Jīvaka-sutta, such a version
could well have existed in another Dharmaguptaka Āgama collection. While the Madhyama-āgama collection preserved in Chinese, which modern scholarship assigns to the
Sarvāstivāda tradition, [45] does not have a parallel to the Jīvaka-sutta, a version of this
discourse could have been found in its Dīrgha-āgama collection, a collection not preserved in Chinese.
The case of the Jīvaka-sutta thus serves as a warning against drawing conclusions
based on the absence of a whole discourse from the Āgamas. Conclusions can certainly
be drawn in the case of the absence of a particular statement or passage from otherwise
similar discourses. But in the case of the absence of a whole discourse from the Chinese
Āgamas, the possibility that this absence could be due to the circumstance that the four
Āgamas translated into Chinese stem from different schools or reciter traditions, with a
differing distribution of the discourses over their respective collections, needs to be
taken into consideration.
The Jīvaka-sutta and its Sanskrit fragment parallel report that Jīvaka had come to pay
a visit to the Buddha, who was staying at Jīvaka’s Mango Grove. The two versions
agree that Jīvaka broached the topic of meat that has been killed on purpose to provide
food for the Buddha or his monks. [46]
A difference between the two versions is that, while in the Pāli account he simply indicates that he has heard of living beings being killed for the sake of the Buddha, according to the Sanskrit fragments a discussion on the topic of meat consumption by the Buddhist monks had arisen at the royal court, with Jīvaka then reporting this discussion to
the Buddha. [47]
In reply, in both versions the Buddha clarifies that it is not proper for his monastic
disciples to partake of meat when they have seen, heard, or can by way of reasoning infer that the animal has been killed for their sake. [48] In the Jīvaka-sutta, the Buddha continues by describing how a monk, who has developed loving kindness and detachment,
receives food from a householder, with Jīvaka confirming that such receiving of food is
certainly blameless.
The Sanskrit fragment instead continues by exploring instances where meat is offered
in an improper way, after which it has an abbreviated reference to the arising of the
Tathāgata and his teaching of the gradual path up to the development of loving kind

45 Cf. above p. 7 note 64.
46 In [[MN55]] at MN I 368,22, the rumour Jīvaka reports is that the Buddha himself partakes of meat killed
for his sake and the discussion only later shifts to the proper behaviour of monks in regard to meat consumption. In DĀ (Skt) fragment 433r, the issue at stake is from the outset the conduct of the monks.

ness. [49] Here, too, Jīvaka comes to the conclusion that the partaking of food by such a
monk is appropriate.
After the description of the monk who partakes of food blamelessly, the Jīvaka-sutta
reports an exchange between Jīvaka and the Buddha about the Buddha’s own endowment with loving kindness. In this exchange, Jīvaka proclaims that he has heard that
the Buddha abides in loving kindness. The Buddha in reply clarifies that he has eradicated any defilement that would be opposed to loving kindness. This exchange does
not appear to be found in the Sanskrit fragment version.

MN I 370   The Jīvaka-sutta repeats its exposition of the blameless monk and the Buddha’s own
mental accomplishment for the remaining three brahmavihāras of compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity. The Sanskrit fragment version does not appear to have preserved a comparable treatment of the other brahmavihāras.

MN I 371   With this part of its exposition concluded, the Jīvaka-sutta turns to five instances of
demerit incurred by someone who kills a living being for the sake of the Buddha or his
disciples, followed by concluding with Jīvaka’s delight and taking refuge. [50] The Sanskrit fragment instead reports that Jīvaka invited the Buddha to a meal, followed by describing how the next day this meal offering took place. [51]


[[MN56]] Upāli-sutta [52]
The Upāli-sutta, the “discourse to Upāli”, records the conversion of the Jain lay follower Upāli. This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama. [53] Sections of this
discourse have also been preserved in Sanskrit fragments, [54] as well as in a partial dis

49 The standard form of this reference begins with iha śāstā loka utpadyate, followed by an indication that
the section on morality (śīlaskandha) should be supplemented; for a discussion of this type of reference

course quotation in Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya, extant
in Tibetan. [55]
The Upāli-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel report in similar terms a conversation between the Jain monk Dīgha Tapassī and the Buddha, each presenting their respective views to the other. [56] The question at the heart of their exchange was the relative importance of bodily, verbal, and mental activities in relation to evil deeds. While
the Pāli version considers these three activities from the perspective of their relation to
“performing” evil deeds, [57] the Chinese version instead presents them from the perspective of “not doing” evil deeds, in the sense of refraining from them, a presentation also
found in the Sanskrit fragments. [58]
This slightly different formulation in the Chinese and Sanskrit versions helps to get a
clearer picture of the proposition attributed to Dīgha Tapassī. According to the Pāli and
Chinese accounts, Dīgha Tapassī had made a special point of formulating his position
by using the expression “punishment” or “rod” (da��a). [59] Another meaning of the
same term is also “control” or “restraint”, and this appears to be the meaning best


folios 20 and 21, SHT III 872, and SHT VI 1291 parallel the final verses at MN I 386. A fragment parallel to part of the discussion at MN I 376-378 can also be found in Lévi 1925a: 27-30, and another fragment parallel to the beginning part of the visit described at MN I 382 in Nakatani 1986: 313-314. Fragments of the final verses can also be found in Hoernle 1916/1970: 28-35 and Waldschmidt 1979.
55 Cf. below note 66.
56 A minor difference is that in [[MA133]] at T I 628a21+23, Dīgha Tapassī and the Buddha just address each
other by their proper names, whereas in [[MN56]] at MN I 372,10 Dīgha Tapassī additionally uses the address “friend”, āvuso. Feer 1887: 315 note 1 takes this to be an expression of a lack of respect, since unlike Dīgha Tapassī the Buddha was the leader of a school, so that it would have been improper for Dīgha
to treat the Buddha as his equal by addressing him as “friend”. Other discourses, however, similarly record the Buddha and Jain monks addressing each other as “friend” (cf. [[MN14]] at MN I 92,33+36 or [[MN101]] at MN II 214,23+25), a form of address also used among Buddhist monks. Moreover, [[MN56]] at MN
I 372,5 depicts Dīgha Tapassī as taking a low seat, while [[MA133]] at T I 628c7 reports that he respectfully circumambulated the Buddha thrice before leaving. Although these are standard pericopes in the
respective discourse collections, their occurrence in the present context shows that both discourses did
not intend to present Dīgha Tapassī in a particularly disrespectful attitude towards the Buddha. Besides,
a stone carving of the Bharhut stūpa with the inscription dighatapasisise anusāsati shows what presumably would be the same Dīgha Tapassī teaching a group of disciples, cf. Cunningham 1879: 97 and
plate 48 and Lüders 1963: 159-160. This suggests Dīgha Tapassī to have been an important or even a
chief disciple of Niga��ha Nātaputta, which would make it less surprising for him to address the Buddha
as “friend”. Regarding his name, Jaini 1979/1998: 21 explains that “dīgha-tapassī (he who engages in
extended penances) ... probably alludes to ... fasting”, in the sense of regularly “abstaining from water as
well as food” for prolonged periods. Such practices were held in high esteem in the Jain tradition and
their undertaking would have earned the Buddha’s visitor such an honorific title.

suited to the present context. [60] Hence, following the account in the Chinese version and
the Sanskrit fragment, the point of Dīgha Tapassī’s proposition was that bodily “restraint” is of greater importance for “not doing” evil deeds, whereas restraint of the
other two doors of action is of comparatively less importance. [61] This presentation finds
support in another Pāli discourse, in which Jain monks describe their practice to be indeed “restraint” of bodily, verbal, and mental activities, a restraint undertaken in order
to avoid evil deeds. [62]

MN I 374  According to the Upāli-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel, Dīgha Tapassī reported the conversation he had with the Buddha to his teacher Niga��ha Nātaputta, describing how he had upheld the prime importance of bodily restraint against the Buddha, who had accorded foremost importance to mental action. [63] On hearing this report,
the lay follower Upāli expressed his wish to refute the Buddha on this issue.
According to both versions, Upāli illustrated how he would defeat the Buddha with a
set of similes (see table 6.3). With a slight difference in sequence, the main ideas conveyed by these four similes are to compare the Buddha’s impending defeat to:

         - dragging a longhaired sheep around,

         - a brewer who moves a sieve in water,

         - someone who shakes out a sieve or a fur, [64]

         - a sixty-year old elephant that plunges into water. [65]


60 MW: 466 s.v. da��a. Feer 1888: 237 points out that a passage in Manu 12.10.11 refers to bodily, verbal,
and mental da��a, where da��a similarly has the sense of “control”.
61 The commentary, Ps III 52,17, suggests that the Jains came to this conclusion because they thought bodily and verbal acts are performed without any participation of the mind, acittaka. Chaudhary 1994b: 133
comments that in “the Upāli-sutta ... Niga��ha Nātaputta’s view has not been presented correctly ... if ...

[the] Buddha regards cetanā as kamma ... Niga��ha Nātaputta also holds the same view”; cf. also Caillat
1965: 126. According to Johnson 1995: 19, however, “the emphasis in the earliest [Jain] texts is not on
intention or lack of it as such ... actions are judged, in the first place, according to their result, not according to the intention of the author”.
62 [[MN101]] at MN II 218,7: “being restrained in body, speech, and mind, that is the not doing of evil deeds
in the future”, kāyena sa�vutā vācāya sa�vutā manasā sa�vutā, ta� āyati� pāpassa kammassa akara�a� (B [e] -MN III 5,7 and S [e] -MN III 7,5: pāpakammassa).
63 At the background to this difference on the relative importance of the three types of activity stands the
early Buddhist emphasis on intention. Bronkhorst 2007: 52 notes that, from a Buddhist viewpoint, “the
real problem does not lie with one’s acts as such, but with the driving force behind those acts”. Hence as
noted by Jain 1966: 169, the present discussion in [[MN56]] reflects the “distinct connotations the term
‘karma’ has” in Buddhism and Jainism, where for the former “it signifies volitional action”; cf. also Ergardt 1986: 69 and von Glasenapp 1951: 76. De Jong 1964: 427 explains that “Buddhist thought catalogues deeds as deeds of the body, of the word and of the mind. The core of each category of deeds is
not the deed itself, but the intention which motivates it. Such a system of intentionalist ethics had no
room for asceticism” of the type undertaken by the Jains; cf. also McDermott 1984/2003: 68, who emphasizes “the ethical force the Buddha believed mental acts (manokamma) to carry”, and Upadhyaya
1971: 94, who concludes that due to their different conceptions of karma “the Jains are, thus, led to
preach self-mortification as against self-discipline preached by the Buddhists”.
64 [[MN56]] at MN I 374,35 mentions shaking out a “hair-sieve”, vāla (Se-MN II 58,19: thāla), while [[MA133]]
at T I 629a1 speaks of shaking out a “hairy fur coat”,, in order to remove the dust.

In both versions, Dīgha Tapassī expressed his apprehension that Upāli might be won
over by the Buddha’s converting magic, whereas Niga��ha Nātaputta felt confident to
let Upāli challenge the Buddha.

The ensuing encounter between Upāli and the Buddha has also been preserved in a
discourse quotation in Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya, preserved in Tibetan. [66] According to the Pāli version, when approaching the Buddha Upāli
behaved in a respectful way, paying homage and using the respectful address “venerable sir” (bhante). [67] The Chinese and Tibetan versions do not record him paying homage and instead depict him addressing the Buddha by his name, a less respectful way of
address. [68]
In view of Upāli’s staunch partisanship for the Jains and his earlier somewhat boastful description of how he was going to defeat the Buddha, the Chinese and Tibetan versions offer a more realistic description of Upāli’s behaviour. Such a way of behaving
with little respect towards the leader of a tradition in which he did not have faith would
also fit well with a later part of the discourse, according to which Upāli, once he had
converted to Buddhism, behaved in a disrespectful manner towards his former teacher
Niga��ha Nātaputta.
Returning to the meeting between Upāli and the Buddha that preceded Upāli’s conversion, the three versions agree on the arguments employed by the Buddha, although
they present these in a slightly different sequence (see table 6.4).
According to the Pāli version, the Buddha opened his series of arguments with the
example of a sick Jain who takes only warm water and refuses to take cold water, as [[AN65]] While in [[MN56]] at MN I 375,2 this elephant plays a game of hemp washing, [[MA133]] at T I 629a6 only
describes that this elephant is being washed by a strong man. The same difference in regard to this elephant imagery recurs between [[MN35]] at MN I 229,3 (which has the same set of four similes as [[MN56]]),
and its parallel [[SA110]] at T II 35b22, cf. above p. 226.

note 8 (cf. also von Hinüber 1991: 124) draws attention to the inappropriateness of pronouncing the
name of a superior person, indicated, e.g., in Vin I 92,36. Hence for the gahapati Upāli to address a
renowned recluse and teacher like the Buddha by his name would imply a lack of respect.

result of which he passes away. [69] Attempting to get at the intent of this simile, what apparently caused the Jain’s death was his refusal to drink water that according to his
code of conduct was not proper for consumption. [70] Behind this concern about water
stands the belief that water contains minute living beings, so that its use entails harming such beings. [71] The same concern for minute living beings found in water also apparently led to two rules found in the different Vinayas, which enjoin to use only water
that does not contain living beings. [72] These regulations are only concerned with visible
beings, however, so that filtering water is considered sufficient and there is no need for
water to be boiled in order to be rendered fit for use.

According to the Upāli-sutta and its parallels, Upāli declared that the type of rebirth
of this Jain would be determined by his degree of mental attachment, a statement the
Buddha showed to be in contradiction to the position Upāli was trying to uphold.
The Pāli, Chinese, and Tibetan versions also take up the case of a Jain who unintentionally kills living beings while walking. According to Upāli, such a Jain will incur
greater blame if he does so intentionally. The Pāli and Tibetan versions describe this
Jain as one who is curbed by a fourfold restraint. [73] The Chinese parallel does not men

not specify that the Jain in question is sick.
70 According to the Jain Āyāra�ga 2.6.2.2 in Jacobi 1882: 104,20, translated in Jacobi 1884/1996: 170, a
monk should refuse cold water that has been offered to him since it is not acceptable; cf. also Āyāra�ga
2.1.7.7. Similarly, Uttarājjhaya�[[AN2.4]] in Charpentier 1922: 75,14 prohibits the use of cold water. Lalwani 1973a: 16 explains that “water that a monk may accept ... must boil thrice on fire before it is acceptable”, cf. also ibid. p. 154 (8.6).
71 Ps III 57,4.
72 These are pācittiya or pātayantika rules 19 + 62 in the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, T 1428 at T XXII 646c18
and T XXII 677c2, rules 19 + 41 in the Kāśyapīya Vinaya, T 1460 at T XXIV 662b19+c21, rule 20 in
the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya, T 1421 at T XXII 45a6 (as Pachow 1955: 143 notes, the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya has
this regulation as a single rule), rules 19 + 51 in the Mahāsā�ghika Vinaya, T 1425 at T XXII 345a14
and T XXII 372c23, rules 19 + 41 in the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, T 1442 at T XXIII 789b21 and T
XXIII 828c5, rules 19 + 41 in the Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, T 1435 at T XXIII 79c15 and T XXIII 97b18,
and rules 20 + 62 in the Theravāda Vinaya at Vin IV 49,3 and Vin IV 125,20. These rules prohibit pouring out or using water that contains living beings. A description of how this observance was carried out
in seventh century India can be found in Yìjìng's ( ) travel records, T 2125 at T LIV 208a13, translated in Takakusu 1966: 30-33.
73 [[MN56]] at MN I 377,1: cātuyāmasa�varasa�vuto. In the Tibetan version, the Jain who passes away due
to refusing cold water is similarly observing the fourfold restraint, so that here this qualification occurs
義淨


Chapter 6 Gahapati-vagga                                      -  325


tion such a fourfold restraint. It also differs in as much as it describes this Jain as
someone who is charitable. [74]
In the Chinese version, this description is the first of the examples used by the Buddha (see above table 6.4), which due to speaking of someone who is charitable is formulated in such a way as to be applicable to the case of a lay follower of the Jains.
Hence, this example could be directly aimed at Upāli himself. This would correspond
to a strategy the discourses frequently attributed to the Buddha in, which consists in
providing an illustration taken from the thought-world and social circumstances of his
interlocutor(s).
In the present case this strategy would be particularly apt, since in the Chinese version this proposition is formulated in such a way that, should Upāli have refused to distinguish between intentional and unintentional killing of living beings, he would thereby have committed himself to the position that, by simply walking, a charitable and
well-conducted lay supporter of the Jains (like himself) will inevitably incur great demerit. [75]
Concerning the reference to the fourfold restraint in the Pāli and Tibetan versions, it
is noteworthy that whereas the Sāmaññaphala-sutta reckons the fourfold restraint a
teaching of Niga��ha Nātaputta, the Chinese, Sanskrit, and Tibetan parallels to the Sāmaññaphala-sutta do not mention such a fourfold restraint. [76] In fact, this fourfold restraint may not have been a teaching of Mahāvīra, but rather of his predecessor Pārśva. [77]

twice, D (4094) mngon pa, ju 246b7 and 247a4 or Q (5595) tu 281b7 and 282a3. The implications of this
fourfold restraint can be seen in [[DN25]] at DN III 48,17, according to which it involves not harming living beings, not taking what is not given, not speaking falsehood, and not yearning for sensual pleasures
(for the last of the four restraints I follow the gloss at Ps III 58,19); cf. also Jaini 2002/2003: 122-128.
74 [[MA133]] at T I 629b22.
75 Johnson 1995: 13 comments that “it is perhaps significant that it is a lay disciple of Mahāvīra who is converted by the Buddha, since the Buddha’s view of what is karmically binding, as represented in the Upālisutta, is clearly more compatible with lay life than the view attributed to Mahāvīra”; cf. also Gombrich
1975b: 219 and id. 2005: 731, who notes that, in contrast to Jainism, “Buddhism offered a viable path to
everyone, not just to those prepared to become extremely ascetic renunciates”.
76 Instead of the fourfold restraint mentioned at [[DN2]] at DN I 57,24, according to [[DA27]] at T I 109a6 Niga��ha Nātaputta claimed omniscience, according to [[EA43.7]] at T II 763c1 he denied causality, according to T 22 at T I 272b4 he explained that what one experiences is due to one’s former deeds, and according to the Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1978a: 226,4 his position was that the retribution for former
deeds needs to be eradicated through penance, while new deeds should be avoided through restraint.
Except for [[EA43.7]] the descriptions of Niga��ha Nātaputta’s teachings found in the parallels to [[DN2]]
correspond to other Pāli passages: [[MN14]] at MN I 92,36, [[MN79]] at MN II 31,7, [[MN101]] at MN II 218,1,
[[AN3.74]] at AN I 220,27, and [[AN9.38]] at AN IV 429,1 report that Niga��ha Nātaputta claimed omniscience, while [[MN14]] at MN I 93,2 and [[MN101]] at MN II 218,4 record that he taught that former deeds
need to be eradicated through penance and new deeds should be avoided by restraint, a proposition that
involves the belief that all one’s present experiences are due to one’s former deeds. On the description
of Niga��ha Nātaputta’s teaching in the parallels to [[DN2]] cf. also Bapat 1948: 109-112, Macqueen 1988:
149-164, and Meisig 1987b: 160-167. Another reference to the fourfold restraint in [[SN2.30]] at SN I 66,17
(or SN [2] 111 at SN [2] I 153,7) does, however, recur in one of its parallels, namely in SĀ [2] 307 at T II 478a1.
77 Bhagat 1976: 171, Bronkhorst 2000c: 515, Jacobi 1880: 160, Jaini 2002/2003: 119, Leumann 1922:


326   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


MN I 377  The Upāli-sutta and its parallels continue in similar ways by contrasting someone,
who attempts to kill all the inhabitants of Nā�andā by taking up a sword, with someone,
who attempts to do the same through supernormal powers, followed by taking up an
ancient account according to which the origin of several forests was due to an act of
will by seers (isi or ��i) endowed with magical powers. [78]

MN I 378  Upāli expresses his approval at this point. According to the Pāli account, Upāli had
already been convinced by the first example given by the Buddha, yet he nevertheless
had continued to oppose the Buddha in order to hear alternative explanations. The Chinese and Tibetan version, as well as a Sanskrit fragment parallel, however, report that
at the present junction of events Upāli remained silent and reflective, followed by coming to the conclusion that the position he had taken up was foolish indeed. [79] Hence according to these versions, Upāli was apparently convinced only at this point, whereas
according to the Pāli account the first argument of the Buddha had already been sufficient to persuade him and the discussion had only lasted so long because Upāli wanted
to enjoy the Buddha’s skill at providing illustrative examples.
The idea of maintaining opposition in order to hear more arguments recurs in the Pāyāsi-sutta. The Pāyāsi-sutta and its Chinese parallels report that Prince Pāyāsi continued to oppose the monk Kumāra Kassapa in order to enjoy the latter’s eloquent presentation, although he had already been convinced of the falseness of his own position by
the first illustration provided by Kumāra Kassapa. [80] Although the same might have
been the case with Upāli, given that he had been a staunch follower of the Jains and
thus would have been firmly convinced of the truth of their position on bodily, verbal,
and mental deeds, it would also not be surprising if it took several illustrations and
some time before he was convinced of the opposite position.
The Upāli-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel continue with Upāli’s formal declaration of his conversion. According to the Majjhima-nikāya version, the Buddha advised Upāli to reflect carefully on this decision. The Madhyama-āgama version reports


135-136, and Mette 1995: 181. Caillat 2003: 35 explains that, although Mahāvīra had “first accepted the
dharma preached by his predecessor Pārśva, that was characterized by four restraints, he soon replaced
it by the ‘dharma of the five great vows’”. Balbir 2000: 13 concludes that “although the Pāli canon speaks
of Niga��ha Nātaputta, whom it knew to be the same as Mahāvīra, it hands down the doctrine specific to
his predecessor Pārśva”; cf. also Jacobi 1884/1996: xx, id. 1895/1996: xxi, Jain 1972: 25, 120-122, id.
1990: 352, and Tatia 1980: 321. Jain 1926: 707, however, holds that the reference in Buddhist texts to
the fourfold restraint “does not refer to the four vows of Pārśva”.
78 These events are also referred to in Mil 130,6. The events that led to the destruction of the realm of King
Da��akī are reported in Jā 522 at Jā V 134,3, with a counterpart in the Mahāvastu in Basak 1968/2004:
217,2 or in Senart 1897: 363,6; cf. also von Hinüber 1998: 132-136 and Lüders 1940d: 626-630. T 212
at T IV 660c17 gives a short discourse quotation that seems to stem from the present passage.

that the Buddha even told Upāli to keep silent and not proclaim his conversion at all. [81]
Both versions record that Upāli was very pleased at finding that the Buddha, instead of
turning Upāli’s conversion to good use for propaganda purposes, advised him in such a
manner.
According to the Upāli-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel, the Buddha also requested Upāli to continue giving alms to the Jains. [82] A difference is that, before this request, according to the Madhyama-āgama version Upāli had declared that from now on
he would close the door of his house to the Jains and open it to the Buddhist monastic
and lay community. [83] This declaration fits the context well, as it provides a reason for
the Buddha to bring up the issue of giving alms to the Jains.
The Upāli-sutta and its parallel agree that Upāli expressed his pleasure at this magnanimous suggestion by the Buddha and reported the hearsay that the Buddha wanted
gifts to be given only to himself and his disciples, not to others. According to the Madhyama-āgama account, the Buddha declared that this report was false. He explained that
gifts should be given where one’s heart finds delight, adding that gifts given to those
who live diligently are more fruitful than gifts given to those who live in negligence. [84]
According to the Upāli-sutta and its parallel, the Buddha next delivered a gradual
instruction, during which Upāli became a stream-enterer. The Majjhima-nikāya version
describes Upāli’s stream-entry in terms of his realization that “whatever is subject to
arising, all that is subject to cessation”. [85] The Madhyama-āgama version instead specifies that he reached a vision of the four noble truths. [86]
The pericope that describes stream-entry as the realization that “whatever is subject
to arising, all that is subject to cessation” tends to be generally absent from Āgama parallels to occurrences of this formula in Pāli discourses. [87] Nevertheless, the formula is


81 [[MN56]] at MN I 379,3 and [[MA133]] at T I 630a25. The description of this episode in [[MN56]] recurs in
similar terms in relation to the conversion of Sīha at Vin I 236,17 and in [[AN8.12]] at AN IV 185,9.

is reported in [[EA45.7]] at T II 775b12.

397b8. Another reference to the rumour that the Buddha would discourage people from giving to others
can be found in [[AN5.50]] at AN I 161,1 and in [[EA47.3]] at T II 781a27.

not entirely unknown to the Chinese canon, as it is found in a discourse in the Sa�yukta-āgama and in some other works. [88]

MN I 380 The Upāli-sutta and its Chinese parallel report that, on arriving home, Upāli instructed
his door keeper that he should no longer let Jain mendicants enter his house and instead
admit the disciples of the Buddha. Dīgha Tapassī conveyed this unexpected turn of
events to Niga��ha Nātaputta who, unable to believe it to be true, himself approached
Upāli in order to find out what had happened. [89]


T II 250a2, SĀ [2] 203 at T II 449b24 (cf. the full formula at T II 423b7), the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-(upadeśa-)śāstra in T 1509 at T XXV 62a22, the *Mahāvibhā�ā in T 1545 at T XXVII 510a28, the Tibetan
(Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya in Eimer 1983: 105,2, Sanskrit fragment fol. 166b1 in Pischel 1904: 816,
the Avadānaśataka in Speyer 1909/1970: 194,7 or Vaidya 1958a: 258,21, and a Tibetan Avadāna collection in Devacandra 1996: 718,6. The same is the case for [[MN91]] at MN II 145,14 and its parallels [[MA161]] at T I 689b25 and T 76 at T I 885c28. Yet another example of this tendency is [[SN56.11]] at SN V
423,15 and its parallels [[SA379]] at T II 104a9, [[EA24.5]] at T II 619b7, T 109 at T II 503c14, T 110 at T II
504b8, the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya in T 1421 at T XXII 104c18, the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya in T 1428 at T
XXII 788b25, the Sarvāstivāda Vinaya in T 1435 at T XXIII 448c14, the Mahāvastu in Basak 1968/
2004: 199,12 or in Senart 1897: 333,19, the Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1977: 136,15, and its Chinese
counterpart in T 1450 at T XXIV 128a9. The same pattern also applies to [[AN8.12]] at AN IV 186,22 and
its parallels in the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, T 1428 at T XXII 872a15, and in the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya, T
1421 at T XXII 149c4. It also applies to [[AN8.21]] at AN IV 210,5 (=[[AN8.22]] at AN IV 213,26) with its
parallel [[MA38]] at T I 480a2 (taking into account only cases where the parallels also describe streamentry attainment).
88 [[SA396]] at T II 106c21: “whatever is of a nature to arise, all that has ceased”, (this
discourse does not appear to have a Pāli parallel). Another instance can be found in the, a
biography of the Buddha usually referred to as the *Abhini�krama�a-sūtra (Durt 2004: 56 points out
that a more correct rendering would be “Sūtra on the Collected Original Activities of the Buddha”), for
a brief survey of this work cf., e.g., Rajapatirana 1961: 96. In a counterpart to an occurrence of the ya�
kiñci samudayadhamma�, sabba� ta� nirodhadhamma� pericope (found in the description of the
stream-entry of the mother of Yasa described in Vin I 18,19), this text, T 190 at T III 819a21 (cf. also T
190 at T III 837b18), describes that “she attained the pure Dharma-eye: ‘whatever is of a stained nature,
can all be eradicated’ – she completely knew it”, . Alternative formulations in the same work are T 190 at T III 876c6, which instead of “whatever is of a stained
nature” speaks of “conditioned states”,, as does another occurrence, T 190 at T III 877a 所有集法, 一切滅已 7,
with the slightly different expression, while yet another occurrence in the same work, T 190 佛本行集經
at T III 898b6, has a reading that corresponds closely to the Pāli pericope: “whatsoever is of a nature to
arise, all that has the characteristic to cease”, . A similar close correspondence can
be seen in the formulation used to describe stream-entry in Buddhavarman’s Vibhā�ā, T 1546 at T
XXVIII 256a15:, and in the *Tattvasiddhi, T 1646 at T XXXII 257a20:
, T XXXII 363b24:, and T XXXII 370c15:
(notably the last two quotes are introduced as sūtra quotations). A passage in the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-(upadeśa-)śāstra uses a formulation that matches 得淨法眼, the Pāli pericope 所有垢法, precisely, 諸可滅法, T 1509 一切知已 at T XXV 348c25:
, although the context differs in as much as the point at stake is the career of a bodhisattva. 諸有為法
89 According to [[MN56]] at MN I 382,13, 一切行法 Niga��ha Nātaputta went to Upāli’s house in the company of a
“large” group of followers, mahatiyā niga��haparisāya saddhi�, while [[MA133]] at T I 631b8 refers to
the same following in terms of “five hundred men 所有集法, ”, 悉皆滅相, a way of expressing the idea of a “large
group” found also in the Sanskrit fragments, cf. SHT IV 412 folio 18V4 and Nakatani 1986: 313. An能知集法, 皆是滅相 所有集相,
皆是滅相 行者於集生相法, 知盡滅相 所有生相, 皆知滅相
所有集法, 皆是滅法
五百人


Chapter 6 Gahapati-vagga                                      -  329


According to the Upāli-sutta and its parallel, Upāli received Niga��ha Nātaputta by MN I 383
taking himself the best seat. The Madhyama-āgama discourse reports that, when questioned by Niga��ha Nātaputta why he had taken the best seat and was behaving as if he
were a recluse himself, [90] Upāli replied that it was his right to offer whatever he wanted,
since he was the owner of these seats.
In both versions, Niga��ha Nātaputta illustrates Upāli’s unsuccessful attempt to refute the Buddha with two similes. The first simile in the Pāli version could be describing someone who loses his testicles when going in search for eggs, an image that would
involve a word play on the term a��a, which can mean egg or testicle. [91] The corresponding simile in the Chinese version, which here comes as the second simile, instead describes someone who is thirsty and enters a lake, but then emerges from the lake still
thirsty. [92] The Sanskrit fragment has preserved a few parts of this simile, which could
point to yet another image, namely that of a man who searches for a bull, but comes
back having lost his testicles, an image that would involve a word play on bull, v��an,
and testicle, v��a�a. [93]

other minor difference is that according to [[MN56]] at MN I 382,28 the doorkeeper addressed Upāli with
the epithet bhante. According to [[MA133]] at T I 631b16, he rather used the address “householder”,,
although during his exchange with the leader of the Jains, [[MA133]] at T I 631b15, the doorkeeper referred to Upāli as, corresponding to bhante, which in the present context would perhaps be more
appropriately rendered as “honourable”.
90 [[MA133]] at T I 631c5 notes that he behaved “just like one gone forth, like one practising the path, not
differently”, ; cf. also the Sanskrit fragment SHT IV 412 folio 19V2, which reads
(prav)r(a)j(i)tasamā(na), “like one gone forth”. A to some extent comparable demonstration of lack of
respect for one’s former teacher is reported in the Jain work Uvāsagadasāo, translated in Hoernle 1885/
1989: 141-142, in this case undertaken by a householder just converted to Jainism who is visited by his
former teacher Gosāla Ma�khaliputta.
91 [[MN56]] at MN I 383,25: a��ahārako gantvā ubbhatehi a��ehi āgaccheyya. CPD I: 76 s.v. a��a-hāraka 居士
suggests that a��ahārako refers to “one who is going (searching) for eggs” as a pun on his loss of testicles. An alternative understanding of the passage can be found in Chalmers 1926: 275, who speaks of 尊者 “a
gelder who successfully returns with a pair of testicles removed”. Similar understandings are reflected
in the translations by Horner 1957/1970: 48, who renders the passage as: “a gelder, having gone away,
might return with removed testicles 如出家者, 學道, 無異 ”, and by Ñā�amoli 1995/2005: 488, who translates it as: “a man
went to castrate someone and came back castrated himself”. Yet, according to Perera 1993: 141, “the castrated eunuch ... was an alien factor in ancient Indian sex life”, as canonical references to eunuchs are to
“congenital sexual weaklings ... and not [to] a castrate” (ibid. p. 137). This would make it less probable
that the original intent of the simile involved castration.
92 [[MA133]] at T I 631c12.
93 In the Sanskrit fragment this is the first of the two similes delivered by Niga��ha Nātaputta and reads
avagāhet, “he may plunge into” or “bathe in”, cf. SHT IV 412 folio 19R1. The reference to thirst,, in
[[MA133]] at T I 631c12 could according to SHT IV p. 39 note 26 be due to a confusion between t���ā and
v��an in the original. On this assumption, the Sanskrit fragment could be restored to read avagāhet sa
tatra ubhābhy(ā� v)�(�a�ābhyām udbh�t)ā[bh](yā)m āgacched, describing someone who “plunges
into” a forest or even a small pond in order to catch a bull (v��an) and thereby loses both testicles (v��a�a). The idea could then be that, when bulls have been left to roam freely for some time, they might
express their displeasure at being caught, which they know to mean that they will have to work, by sudden and unexpected thrusts with their horns, an action that could indeed damage someone’s testicles.
渴

The other simile in the Pāli version could be about someone who searches for myrobalan fruits and returns having lost his eyes. [94] This instance would then again involve a
word play, this time on the word akkha, which can mean eye as well as myrobalan fruit,
a fruit whose seeds were used as dice in ancient India. The corresponding simile in the
Chinese version indicates that this man enters the forest in search of myrobalan fruit, to
which the Sanskrit version adds that he carried a sharp axe along, thereby corroborating that this man would indeed have been in search of some forest products. [95]

MN I 384  The Upāli-sutta and its parallel report that Upāli was quick to reply to these two similes
with a simile on his part, indicating that the teaching of the Jains does not withstand
closer scrutiny just as a monkey will not survive being pounded.
According to the Madhyama-āgama account, at this point Niga��ha Nātaputta finally
came to the conclusion that Upāli had indeed fallen prey to the Buddha’s converting
magic, while according to the Majjhima-nikāya version he had already come to the same
conclusion earlier. [96] In reply to Niga��ha Nātaputta’s allegation that he was under the
influence of the Buddha’s conversion magic, both versions report Upāli’s proclamation
that all his relatives and friends, even all men and gods would benefit from coming under the sway of this converting magic of the Buddha. [97] Asked by Niga��ha Nātaputta
whom he considered his teacher, Upāli delivered a series of impromptu stanzas in
praise of the Buddha, repeatedly declaring that he was now a disciple of the Buddha.
The praise delivered by Upāli runs into ten stanzas in the Pāli, Sanskrit, and Chinese
versions. [98] The three versions of these stanzas are similar in content while differing in

94 [[MN56]] at MN I 383,26: akkhikahārako gantvā ubbhatehi akkhīhi āgaccheyya. CPD I: 10 s.v. akkha2
gives “name of a tree, Beleric Myrobalan (Terminalia Belerica), the seeds of which were used as dice”
as one of the meanings of akkha, cf. also ibid. p. 13 s.v. akkhikā and akkhika-hāraka, and the similar
explanation in MW: 3 s.v. ak�a [2] . An alternative understanding can be found in Chalmers 1926: 275,
who speaks of a “gouger who returns with a pair of eyeballs excised”, an understanding also followed
by Horner 1957/1970: 48, who translates the passage as: “a gouger, having gone away, might return
with removed eyeballs”, and Ñā�amoli 1995/2005: 488, who translates it as: “a man went to put out
someone’s eyes and came back with his own eyes put out”.
95 [[MA133]] at T I 631c10 describes a man who enters the forest in search of eyes, . SHT IV
412 folio 19R2 reads ak�ārthī ak�a[ga](ve�)[ī] tīk��a� ku�hāram ādāya vana� pra(viśe)t (for the continuation of this section cf. also the Hoernle fragment Or. 152003/23ve in Wille 2006: 72). The idea of
losing one’s eyes while searching for some fruit or seed in the forest could be that while moving among
trees and branches this person might stumble, or a branch might snap back, which could then cause
damage to the eyes.
96 [[MA133]] at T I 632a25. [[MN56]] at MN I 383,30 reports that Niga��ha Nātaputta drew this conclusion already when delivering his two similes. SHT IV 421 folio 20V5 concords with [[MA133]] since it has the
reference to the magical conversion, [ā]vartanī māyā, after the monkey simile delivered by Upāli. The
suggestion that the Buddha knew a converting magic recurs in [[AN4.193]] at AN II 190,25 and in [[EA47.3]]
at T II 781b7 (which explicitly indicates that this rumour was being spread by the Jains); cf. also SN 有人求眼入林
42:13 at SN IV 340,22.
97 [[MN56]] at MN I 383,32 and [[MA133]] at T I 632a26. For a similar declaration cf. [[AN4.193]] at AN II 194,2.
98 To these ten stanzas, [[MA133]] at T I 632c7 adds a reciter’s remark as an eleventh stanza, found also in
the Sanskrit fragment in Waldschmidt 1979: 13. This eleventh stanza explains that Upāli spoke without
preparation, to which [[MA133]] adds that devas had helped him in his poetic impromptu performance.


Chapter 6 Gahapati-vagga                                      -  331


matters of sequence and on some of the qualities mentioned. Although an exhaustive
examination of the differences found in the three versions of Upāli’s verses would require a study in itself, [99] a few points can nevertheless be made.
In the first stanza, the Pāli version highlights the Buddha’s accomplishment in ethical
conduct and wisdom. The Chinese version also mentions his practice of meditation or
jhāna, thereby covering all three aspects of the threefold training. [100]
A quality of the Buddha mentioned in the fifth Pāli stanza indicates that he has “lowered”, panna, his banner. [101] The Chinese version speaks instead of the Buddha’s wisdom, corresponding to paññā. [102]
Stanza six in the Upāli-sutta introduces the Buddha as the “seventh of seers”, an expression that could alternatively be understood to qualify him as the “best of seers”. [103]
The Chinese translation supports the interpretation “seventh of seers”, while the Sanskrit fragment can be restored to read the “best of seers”. [104] The Pāli commentary to the
Upāli-sutta agrees with the understanding adopted in the Chinese version and explains
that to speak of the Buddha as the seventh seer refers to him being the seventh Buddha
since Vipassī. [105] The same expression occurs also in the Jain tradition, where its usage
would support the alternative meaning of being the “best of seers”. [106]


99 For a more detailed examination of the Upāli verses in the light of their Sanskrit and Chinese parallels
cf. von Hinüber 1982 (cf. also id. 1985: 75) and Waldschmidt 1979, for metrical emendations of the Pāli
verses cf. Alsdorf 1967: 261-262.
100 [[MN56]] at MN I 386,4: “of developed ethical conduct and of good wisdom”, vuddhasīlassa sādhupaññassa (S [e] -MN II 77,5: buddhasīlassa), [[MA133]] at T I 632b7: “trained in ethical conduct, meditation/
jhāna, and wisdom”, .
101 [[MN56]] at MN I 386,16: pannadhajassa (Ce-MN II 80,18: pannaddhajassa). The same expression occurs in [[MN22]] at MN I 139,36, where to lower the banner represents overcoming the conceit ‘I am’,
asmimāna.
102 [[MA133]] at T I 632b19: “wisdom born”, ; on this epithet cf. von Hinüber 1982: 246-247, id. 1983:
29-32, Minh Chau 1964/1991: 327, Norman 1989b: 387, and id. 2006: 369-371.
103 [[MN56]] at MN I 387,18: isisattamassa.
104 [[MA133]] at T I 632b24: (an expression also found as part of an eulogy of the Buddha in the introductory section of the Ekottarika-āgama at T II 549b13). Waldschmidt 1979: 10 note 68 points out that
while [[MA133]] would have been based on ��isaptamasya, the Sanskrit fragment reads (��isa)ttamasya.
An account of the successful conversion of another lay follower (cf. also above note 82) in [[EA45.7]] at 學戒, 禪, 智慧
T II 775b17 also reports the Buddha being given the epithet “seventh of seers”, .
105 Ps III 97,26: vipassī ādayo cha isayo upādāya sattamassa; for the list of seven Buddhas in the Pāli canon
cf. [[DN14]] at DN II 2,14. Bodhi in Ñā�amoli 1995/2005: 1260 note 596 comments that “it is more probable, however, that sattama here is the superlative of 慧生 sad, and thus the compound means ‘the best of
seers’. The expression isisattama occurs at [[SNP356]] and the commentary to that verse allows both interpretations, offering uttama as a gloss on sattama”. Norman 1993: 123 note 37 draws attention to another commentarial gloss at Th-a III 195, 七仙 25, which similarly offers both explanations. He suggests that
possibly both explanations were current, one of which influenced the Sanskrit text, while the Chinese
translator(s) may have chosen to follow the alternative explanation. Wiltshire 1990: 35 comments that
the Buddha “is rarely referred to simply as an isi, nearly always superlatively as a great seer (mahesi),
bull among seers (isinisabha) and divine seer (devīsi)”. Understanding isisattama 第七仙人 as “best of seers”
would better concord with this pattern noted by Wiltshire. Gombrich 1992b proposes that a misunder

The Pāli version’s stanza eight indicates that the Buddha had crossed over himself
and leads others across. [107] These two qualities are not found in the parallel versions.
Stanza nine in the Pāli version employs the well-known attribute Tathāgata, found
similarly in the Sanskrit fragment. [108] What makes this case noteworthy is that the Chinese parallel renders Tathāgata as “thus gone”. [109] This appears to be a unique instance
in the Chinese Āgamas, as other Āgama discourses invariably employ the translation
“thus come”. [110]
The word tathāgata itself accommodates both ways of understanding, since it can be
understood to denote “thus come” (tathā + āgata), just as it can be taken to mean “thus
gone” (tathā + gata). [111] It is remarkable that the translator(s) of the Madhyama-āgama,
who in all other instances rendered Tathāgata as “thus come”, a rendering well established among Chinese translators, should in this instance have opted for a different translation.
The tenth stanza refers to the Buddha with the term yakkha. [112] The Chinese version
reads “with unsurpassable eyes” instead, [113] which suggests a reading of yakkha as “eye”,
akkha, preceded by the euphonic y-. [114]


standing of isisattama as implying that Gotama Buddha was the “seventh in a series” might have led to
the idea of six previous Buddhas.
106 Cf. Isibhāsiyāi� 38.12 in Schubring 1969: 543,29: ji�a-sattama, on which Norman 1989/1993: 269
comments that this expression “gives only the meaning ‘best of jinas’, since there is no stock list of
seven jinas”.
107 [[MN56]] at MN I 386,26: ti��assa tārayantassa.
108 [[MN56]] at MN I 386,28: tathāgatassa and Waldschmidt 1979: 12: tathāgatasya.

110, which Meisig 2005: 113 considers a warped translation (“schiefe Übersetzung”) of tathāgata. For
other renderings of Tathāgata cf. Nattier 2003b: 210-211.
111 Chalmers 1898: 113 suggests yet another way of understanding the compound as tatha� + āgata, “arrived at truth”. The idea of truth is also the most frequently recurring nuance among the eight explanations of the term Tathāgata given by Buddhaghosa in Sv I 59,31, as well as among the additional set of
eight explanations of the same term offered by Dhammapāla in Ud-[[AN133.5]] The nuance of truth recurs
also in a Jain commentary on the corresponding epithet tahāgaya, cf. Thomas 1936: 783. On the term
Tathāgata cf. also, e.g., Anālayo 2008f, Anesaki 1921, Bodhi 1978, Coomaraswamy 1938, Dutt 1960/
1971: 295-304, Endo 1997/2002: 195-206, de Harlez 1899, Harvey 1983, Habito 1988: 136 note 30,

1, however, holds yakkha or yak�a to be more probable, since this term “need not be interpreted in a
bad sense. The word is often used in the sense of one who possesses divine or superhuman power”. Nakamura 1960: 155 draws attention to the expression yakkhassa suddhi in [[SNP3.4]] at [[SNP478]] and in [[SNP4.11]] at [[SNP875]] and [[SNP876]] explaining that “in later Buddhist mythology yakkha became, so to speak, an
antinom to the Buddha, but in the early stage of Buddhism it was nothing but one of the appellations applied to the Buddha”. He further notes that in Jain texts the corresponding jakkha also has positive connotations. Positive associations are similarly evident in yak�as representations in ancient Indian art, reflecting their cultic importance.

The Pāli and the Chinese version report that on hearing all these praises Niga��ha MN I 387
Nātaputta was so upset that he vomited up blood. According to the Chinese version,
this caused him to pass away, a fatal consequence of Upāli’s verses also recorded in the
Pāli commentary. [115]


[[MN57]] Kukkuravatika-sutta [116]
The Kukkuravatika-sutta, the “discourse on the observance [of behaving like] a dog”,
is an exposition of four types of action to two ascetics who had adopted the observance
of behaving like a cow and like a dog. [117] This discourse does not have a parallel in the
Chinese Āgamas.
The four types of action discussed in the Kukkuravatika-sutta recur in a discourse in
the A�guttara-nikāya. [118] An exposition of these four types of action can also be found


ticular cf., e.g., Agrawala 1965: 110-118, Coomaraswamy 1971: 28-36, Misra 1968, id. 1981, Mitterwallner 1989, Moti Chandra 1954, Quagliotti 2008: 126-128, Sen 1972, Sutherland 1991: 105-136, and
Swearer 2004/2007: 25-26.
115 [[MA133]] at T I 632c18 and Ps III 100,2, cf. also below p. 604. According to Vin I 42,29, the same happened to Sañjaya when his disciples Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna left him to become disciples of the
Buddha. According to Vin II 200,34, Devadatta similarly vomited blood when his followers had been
convinced by Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna to leave Devadatta and become disciples of the Buddha
again. Other instances can be found in [[MN36]] at MN I 237,28, which relates vomiting of blood to unbalanced forms of practice that result in mental derangement, and in [[AN7.68]] at AN IV 135,5, where a
group of monks vomits blood after hearing a rather stern discourse from the Buddha. These instances
suggest that vomiting blood was understood as a physical reaction to a severe psychic shock, a reaction
that, however, need not be fatal.
116 Ce-MN II 84,1 gives the discourse’s title as Kukkuravatiya-sutta, and Se-MN II 79,1 as Kukkurovādasutta.
117 The dog-observance, kukkuravata, recurs in [[DN24]] at DN III 6,9. The dog-observance and the cow-observance, kukkuravrata and govrata, are both mentioned also in the Yogācārabhūmi, Bhattacharya 1957:
157,10 and T 1579 at T XXX 312b11, in addition to which the Sanskrit version also mentions the nakulavrata, the mongoose-observance. In addition to the kukkuravata and the govata, several Jātaka
tales also mention the observance of behaving like a bat, the vaggulivata, cf. Jā 144 at Jā I 493,19, Jā
377 at Jā III 235,19, and Jā 487 at Jā IV 299,13. A reference to the observance of behaving like a goat,
the ajavata, can be found in Jā 489 at Jā IV 318,8. Nidd I 89,16 lists several observances, mentioning
also the observance of behaving like an elephant, like a horse, or like a crow, the hatthivata, the assavata, and the kākavata. The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-(upadeśa-)śāstra, T 1509 at T XXV 226a17, also

as a discourse quotation in Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya. [119] While in the case of this instance the source is uncertain, a comment in the Sa�gītiparyāya on the same four types of action, listed in the Sa�gīti-sutta and its Sanskrit
parallel, [120] explicitly mentions Pu��a, one of the two protagonists of the Kukkuravatika-sutta, and also specifies that he was an observer of the cow-conduct. [121]
Hence, even though the Chinese Āgamas do not have a parallel to the Kukkuravatikasutta, the compilers of the Sa�gītiparyāya were acquainted with a version of this discourse. In this way, the present instance reinforces the point made above in relation to
the Jīvaka-sutta, in that conclusions based on the absence of a discourse from the Chinese Āgamas need to be treated with caution. [122]


[[MN58]] Abhayarājakumāra-sutta

The Abhayarājakumāra-sutta, the “discourse to Prince Abhaya”, describes an attempt
by Prince Abhaya to corner the Buddha with a two-pronged question, in reply to which
the Buddha clarified what types of speech he would use. [123] This discourse does not have
a parallel in the Chinese Āgamas. Parts of this discourse have, however, been preserved
in a Sanskrit fragment, [124] and also in a discourse quotation found in the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-(upadeśa-)śāstra. [125]

MN I 393  The Sanskrit fragment has preserved parts of the introductory narration, which appear
to be similar to the Pāli version’s report that Prince Abhaya had been asked by the
Niga��has to challenge the Buddha with a dilemma, a request to which he agreed. The
dilemma was based on the idea that the Buddha, claiming to be an awakened teacher,
should be compassionate, yet at the same time it was well known that his pronouncement on the evil character of Devadatta had sorely upset the latter.


actions ... as mental, bodily, or verbal actions whose overall morality is complex, that is, not purely
good or evil”, cases that combine “the presence of both wholesome and unwholesome features in the
same action”. Here it is noteworthy that [[AN8.33]] at AN IV 236,15 lists chanda, dosa, moha, and bhaya
as possible motivations for making a gift, dāna, which would appear to imply that a deed that in itself
is wholesome can take place with unwholesome mental qualities at its background.

The next section of the Abhayarājakumāra-sutta has as its counterpart the discourse
quotation in the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-(upadeśa-)śāstra, which records that Prince
Abhaya inquired whether the Buddha would say what is irritating to others, to which
the Buddha replied that there was no direct answer to this question. [126]
The Abhayarājakumāra-sutta and the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-(upadeśa-)śāstra illustrate how beneficial action can at times be painful with the example of how the prince
would extract an object that his infant son had swallowed, even if such an intervention
should hurt the child. [127]
The Abhayarājakumāra-sutta continues with an exposition of the types of speech the
Buddha would utter, followed by clarifying that the answers the Buddha would give to
questions were not pre-meditated. These sections of the discourse are not covered in
the discourse extract preserved in the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-(upadeśa-)śāstra. The Pāli
version concludes with prince Abhaya taking refuge.


[[MN59]] Bahuvedanīya-sutta

The Bahuvedanīya-sutta, the “discourse on much to be felt”, presents a detailed analysis of the nature of feelings. This discourse recurs in the Sa�yutta-nikāya and has a
Chinese parallel in the Sa�yukta-āgama. [128]
Parts of this discourse have also been preserved in Sanskrit fragments, [129] and in a discourse quotation in Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya, extant
in Tibetan. [130]
The Majjhima-nikāya and Sa�yutta-nikāya versions report that a discussion on the
nature of the Buddha’s analysis of feelings had arisen between the monk Udāyī and the
carpenter Pañcaka�ga. While the Sa�yukta-āgama discourse agrees on the nature of


126 [[MN58]] at MN I 393,33 and T 1509 at T XXV 321b15, a question and answer exchange also found in T
1521 at T XXVI 79b5. T 1521 at T XXVI 79b4 also agrees with [[MN58]] on the title of the discourse,
given as “discourse on Prince Fearless”, .
127 [[MN58]] at MN I 395,1 and T 1509 at T XXV 321b19. T 1521 at T XXVI 79b7 uses the same image in a
more general sense, comparing the Buddha’s attitude to a nurse who intervenes in a similar manner
when a small child has swallowed something; a simile found also in [[AN10.6]] at AN III 6,1 and in [[SA685]] at T II 187b8.
128 The Pāli parallel is [[SN36.19]] at SN IV 223-228 and has the title Pañcaka�ga-sutta. The part of [[SN36.19]] that is concerned with the Buddha’s exposition on feeling recurs again in [[SN36.20]] at SN IV
228-229. The Chinese parallel is [[SA485]] at T II 123c-124b, for which Akanuma 1929/1990: 55 gives
the tentative title “Udayi”, . While [[MN59]] has Sāvatthī as its location, [[SA485]] locates the discourse at Rājagaha ([[SN36.19]] does not specify the setting). A translation and discussion of the Pāli and
Chinese versions can be found in Faust-Koschinger 1999, parts of the two discourses have also been 無畏王子經
translated and compared by Choong 2000: 111-114.
129 SHT II 51a (pp. 9-10, cf. also SHT IX p. 370), SHT VIII 1863 (p. 54), and SHT VIII 1884 (p. 73). SHT
II 51a has preserved part of the Buddha’s criticism of those who quarrel about his teachings and the subsequent exposition of increasingly superior types of happiness, found at MN I 398-400. SHT VIII
1863Va and SHT VIII 1884Va-b have preserved part of the conclusion of the discourse.

the issue at stake, it differs in so far as according to its report this had caused the arising of a dispute between the monk Udāyī and King Bimbisāra. [131]

MN I 397  The disagreement between Udāyī and his visitor was whether the Buddha had taught
two or three types of feeling. According to the Pāli versions, Ānanda reported the disagreement between Udāyī and his visitor on the proper way of analysing feelings to the
Buddha. [132] The Sa�yukta-āgama version indicates that Udāyī and his visitor went themselves to present their disagreement to the Buddha. [133]
The three versions agree that the Buddha clarified in reply that he had not only taught
two or three types of feeling, but also six types, eighteen types, thirty-six types, and
even one-hundred-and-eight types. While the Pāli versions only enumerate these types
of feeling, the Chinese version and the discourse quotation in Śamathadeva’s commentary, which has preserved this part of the discourse, [134] follow this listing with a detailed
explanation of each type. A similar explanation can be found in an otherwise unrelated
discourse in the Sa�yutta-nikāya. [135]
The Chinese and Tibetan versions also differ from the Pāli versions in as much as
they additionally mention one type of feeling, four types of feeling, and innumerable
types of feeling (see table 6.5). [136]

136 [[SA485]] at T II 124a5+6+7. The innumerable feelings can also be found in a similar type of listing of feelings in the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-(upadeśa-)śāstra, T 1509 at T XXV 325b9.


Chapter 6 Gahapati-vagga                                      -  337


fers to all feelings being dukkha. [137] This seems to refer to a statement found in a discourse in the Sa�yutta-nikāya and its Sa�yukta-āgama parallel, according to which
whatever is felt is to be included within dukkha. In this statement, however, dukkha
does not refer to a type of feeling, but rather stands for the unsatisfactory nature of conditioned phenomena, due to their impermanent nature. [138] Thus, it would not seem adequate to treat this qualification as if it were to refer to a type of feeling, which is the
case once it is included in the present listing of ‘types’ of feelings.
The Sa�yukta-āgama discourse then explains that the reference to four types of feeling intends feelings which are:

 - conjoined with the element of sensuality,

 - conjoined with the element of materiality,

 - conjoined with the element of immateriality,

 - not conjoined (with any of these three). [139]
A similar analysis can be found in the Abhidharmic exposition of feelings given in
the Vibha�ga. [140]
According to the Sa�yukta-āgama version, innumerable feelings are “this and that”
feelings. [141] This is slightly puzzling, since to speak of “this and that” feelings does not
constitute a category that can be used for analytical purposes.
Here it needs to be borne in mind that the analysis of feelings into various types does
not appear to be motivated by a merely descriptive concern. Distinguishing feelings
into mutually exclusive types would rather have the purpose of eroding the notion of a
substantial self that feels. [142] In such a context to speak of ‘innumerable’ feelings, or ‘this
and that’ feelings, would not yield an analytical tool for differentiating types of feeling
and would thus be of limited use for the purpose for which the whole analytical scheme
would be meant.
The Bahuvedanīya-sutta and its parallels next turn to the dire consequence of getting
into narrow-minded arguments on a particular form of presentation. Although the state

cung zad tshor ba de thams cad ni sdug bsngal ba ste.
138 [[SN36.11]] at SN IV 216,22 and its parallel [[SA473]] at T II 121a9 explain that the statement ya� kiñci vedayita� ta� dukkhasmin ti (S [e] -SN IV 268,8: ya�),, refers to the impermanent nature
of feelings. Other occurrences of this proclamation can be found in [[SN12.32]] at SN II 53,20 and [[SA474]]
at T II 121a22.
139 [[SA485]] at T II 124a10: . D (4094) mngon pa, nyu 5a6 or
Q (5595) thu 36b8 speaks in the last case instead of “undefiled” feelings, zag pa med pa.
140 Vibh 15,7 distinguishes the aggregate of feelings in a fourfold manner: kāmāvacaro, rūpāvacaro, arūpāvacaro, and apariyāpanno. The Vibha�ga has this fourfold analysis as part of its exposition according to the Abhidharmic 所有受, method ( 皆悉是苦 abhidhammabhājaniya), thereby setting it apart from its exposition according to the discourses (suttantabhājaniya).

142 Cf., e.g., [[DN15]] at DN II 66,19 and its parallel [[DA13]] at T I 61c8, which draw attention to the mutually
exclusive nature of the three types of feeling in order to refute self notions in relation to feelings; for a
discussion of this passage cf. Bodhi 1984/1995: 34-37. 欲界繫受, 色界繫受, 無色界繫受, 及不繫受

ments of the monk Udāyī and the carpenter Pañcaka�ga as such were right, both were
wrong in as much as they took a dogmatic stance. Such a dogmatic stance does not do
justice to the teaching, which can be applied in different ways.
The Pāli and Chinese versions next turn to the five types of sensual pleasure. While
in the two Pāli versions this topic comes somewhat abruptly, the Chinese version and
the Sanskrit fragment offer a transition to this exposition. According to these versions,
the Buddha explained that he had indeed taught two types of feeling, an explanation
addressed to Udāyī who earlier had maintained that the Buddha had not taught two types
of feeling. [143] These two types of feeling are those associated with sensuality and those
aloof from sensuality.
As an exposition of this statement, the Buddha then contrasted the feelings that arise
in relation to the five types of sensual pleasure with the feelings that arise in relation to
the four jhānas and the four immaterial attainments, a presentation found similarly in
the Pāli versions.
The Pāli, Chinese, and Sanskrit versions agree in correcting those who believe any of
the jhānas or immaterial attainments to be the supreme experience of pleasant feeling
and happiness, since in each case the next jhāna or immaterial attainment in the series
is superior in happiness.

MN I 400  In all versions, the series culminates with the attainment of the cessation of perceptions and feelings, which the Buddha declared to be the supreme type of happiness,
even though it takes place in the absence of feelings.
This seems to be an implicit corrective of the position held by Udāyī’s visitor, who
had earlier maintained that the Buddha simply reckoned neutral feeling as such to be
peaceful. [144] In this way, by at first distinguishing between sensual and non-sensual
types of feeling and then leading the exposition up to the attainment of cessation, the
Buddha’s exposition seems to deal with both of the stances taken by Udāyī and his
visitor.
In order to explain why even the cessation of feeling could be reckoned a form of happiness, the Pāli versions point out that the Buddha’s conception of happiness is not limited to pleasant feeling. [145] The Chinese version instead distinguishes between four types
of (non-sensual) happiness. [146]

146 [[SA485]] at T II 124b15 distinguishes between the happiness derived from the absence of sensuality, the
happiness of seclusion, the happiness of appeasement, and the happiness of awakening,

[[MN139]] at MN III 233,32. A difference seems to be that [[MN66]] and [[MN139]] use these four terms as

[[MN60]] Apa��aka-sutta

The Apa��aka-sutta, the “discourse on what is sure”, teaches a reasonable approach
to various views apparently propounded in ancient India. This discourse does not seem
to have a parallel in the Chinese Āgamas. A few parts of this discourse have, however,
been preserved in Sanskrit fragments. [147] In addition to these fragment parallels, the Apa��aka-sutta also has partial parallels in other Pāli discourses, as its introductory part recurs in the introduction to the Sāleyyaka-sutta, [148] its examination of views recurs as
part of a discourse in the Sa�yutta-nikāya, [149] and the examination of the four types of
person found in the later part of the Apa��aka-sutta recurs in several other Pāli discourses. [150]


near equivalents to qualify the happiness of jhāna (the same appears to be also implicit in [[MN122]]). [[SA485]] however, introduces this set as four “types” of happiness,, not as four near equivalents for
the same type of happiness, cf. also SHT II 51aR6: catvāry-udāyī sukhā(ni).
147 The Sanskrit fragments are SHT III 966 (p. 226, identified in SHT VII p. 272, cf. also SHT IX p. 405),
SHT IV 165 folio 32 and folio 37 (pp. 206 and 207, identified in SHT VI p. 212), SHT VI 1261 (pp.
54-55), SHT VI 1579 (pp. 197-198, cf. also SHT VIII p. 208), Hoernle fragment 149/add. 135, no. 2 in
Hartmann 1991: 63-64, fragment Or. 15003/44 from the Hoernle collection, published in Wille 2006:
79, and fragment bleu 190 of the Pelliot collection, no. 1 in Hartmann 1991: 62. SHT VI 1261 corresponds to the beginning of the discourse at MN I 401. SHT III 966 refers among others to the view that
“there is no other world”, mentioned at MN I 402,12: n’ atthi paro loko. Pelliot fragment bleu 190 has
parts of the examination of the consequence of this view at MN I 402-403. SHT IV 165 folio 32 has
among others preserved the conclusion “if this word is true”, paralleling MN I 403, 四種樂 7: sacca� vacana�.
SHT VI 1579 has preserved words that parallel several phrases at MN I 406-407, such as the proposition that “evil things come into being with wrong view as their condition”, MN I 406,3: pāpakā akusalā
dhammā sambhavanti micchādi��hipaccayā, or the expression “right speech and non-opposition to noble ones” at MN I 407,4: sammāvācā ariyāna� apaccanīkatā (S [e] -MN II 110,16: appaccanīkatā). The
Hoernle fragments parallel the adopting of the view that there is causality, described at MN I 409,7. In
addition to these, Hartmann 2004b: 126 notes another Sanskrit fragment parallel in the newly discovered Dīrgha-āgama manuscript.

205,23, for Sanskrit fragment versions of this exposition cf. above p. 309 note 2. Since this exposition
on the four types of person bears little relation to the main topic of [[MN60]] Pande 1957: 151 suggests
that “it seems difficult to explain the appendix [i.e., the exposition on the four persons] except through
some gross confusion in transmission”.


## Chapter 7 Bhikkhu-vagga

[[MN61]] Ambala��hikārāhulovāda-sutta [1]
The Ambala��hikārāhulovāda-sutta, the “discourse on an instruction [given] to Rāhula at Ambala��hikā”, records the Buddha’s instruction to his son Rāhula on the evil consequences of speaking falsehood and on the need to reflect repeatedly on the ethical
qualities of an action. This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama, [2] as well
as a parallel in the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinayavibha�ga, preserved in Chinese and Tibetan. [3]
A version of the present meeting between the Buddha and Rāhula can, moreover, be
found in the Chinese Dharmapada Avadāna collection and in the Chinese Udāna-(varga). [4] A few lines of this discourse have also been preserved in a Sanskrit fragment, [5]
and extracts from a version of the present discourse occur in the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-(upadeśa-)śāstra and in the Śrāvakabhūmi. [6]

1 Se-MN II 123,2 has the title “lesser discourse on an instruction to Rāhula”, Cū�arāhulovāda-sutta. The
same title recurs at S [e] -MN III 504,1 as the title for [[MN147]] (a discourse where B [e], E [e], and C [e] also have
the title Cū�arāhulovāda-sutta). As the next discourse in the Majjhima-nikāya is the Mahārāhulovādasutta ([[MN62]]), the Siamese edition’s referring to [[MN61]] as the Cū�arāhulovāda-sutta conforms to a recurrent (but not invariable) pattern in the Majjhima-nikāya of presenting the Mahā- and Cū�a-versions of
a discourse together (cf. above p. 5). In the present case, however, this results in the Siamese Majjhimanikāya edition having two discourses with the same title Cū�arāhulovāda-sutta, namely [[MN61]] and [[MN147]]
2 The parallel is [[MA14]] at T I 436a-437b, entitled the “discourse to Rāhula”, . A quotation from the
present discourse in the Vyākhyāyukti in Lee 2001: 95,12 (noted by Skilling 2000b: 343) similarly speaks
of the Rāhula-sūtra, sgra gcan zin gyi mdo sde; cf. also the reference in Aśoka’s Bhabra edict to the Lāghulovāda, “spoken by the Blessed One, the Buddha, concerning falsehood”, musāvāda� adhigichya
bhagavatā budhena bhāsite, cf. Hultzsch 1925: 173, while Bloch 1950: 154 and Woolner 1924/1993: 34
read adhigicya (cf. also Hultzsch 1925: 173 note 4); on identifying this reference with [[MN61]] cf., e.g.,
Rhys Davids 1896: 95 and Schmithausen 1992: 115. While according to [[MN61]] Rāhula was staying at
Ambala��hikā, a royal park on the road between Rājagaha and Nā�andā, according to [[MA14]] he was staying at Tapodārāma, a grove near a pond fed by a hot spring, situated at the foot of a mountain outside of

342   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


MN I 414 The Ambala��hikārāhulovāda-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel begin by reporting that the Buddha, who had come to visit Rāhula, illustrated the consequences of
speaking falsehood with the help of the water vessel the Buddha had just used to wash
his feet.
The (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinayavibha�ga precedes its account of the visit paid by
the Buddha to Rāhula with a report of what had motivated the Buddha to give such an
instruction to his son, an account found also in the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-(upadeśa-)
śāstra. According to this account, found with a few minor differences in these two
works, Rāhula had in a somewhat playful mood given wrong information to visitors
who had inquired about the Buddha whereabouts. [7] Such behaviour would indeed have
been a good reason for the Buddha to deliver the present discourse on the need to abstain from falsehood.
Although no reference to Rāhula’s mischievous activities is found in the Ambala��hikārāhulovāda-sutta or in its Madhyama-āgama parallel, the Pāli commentary explains
that the Buddha delivered the present instruction thinking that young boys like Rāhula
are prone to falsehood, saying they saw when they did not see, etc. [8] Moreover, the Ambala��hikārāhulovāda-sutta reports that, after delivering a set of similes, the Buddha
told Rāhula that he should not speak a lie even for fun. [9] A similar instruction occurs in
the Madhyama-āgama version after each of the similes. [10] Thus, the commentarial gloss
and the instructions given in the two discourses would fit with the background narration provided in the Vinayavibha�ga as well as in the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-(upadeśa-)śāstra.
To illustrate the consequences of consciously speaking falsehood, according to the
Ambala��hikārāhulovāda-sutta, its Madhyama-āgama parallel, and the account in the
(Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinayavibha�ga the Buddha compared the worth of someone who
speaks falsehood to the small amount of water that was still left in the vessel he had
just used to wash his feet. [11]
While the Chinese Udāna-(varga) account proceeds similarly, [12] according to the Chinese Dharmapada Avadāna tale the Buddha asked Rāhula if the water left in the vessel


7 T 1442 at T XXIII 760b19 as well as D (3) ’dul ba, cha 215a6 or Q (1032) je 199b3 report that Rāhula
used to send visitors, who wished to meet the Buddha, to the wrong location, telling them that the Buddha was at Vulture Peak when in reality he was in the Bamboo Grove, etc. The account in the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-(upadeśa-)śāstra, T 1509 at T XXV 158a12 (cf. also T 1813 at T XL 623b17), differs in
so far as it reports that Rāhula had told the visitors that the Buddha was away, even though the Buddha
was there, or else he had told them that the Buddha was in, when in reality the Buddha had left.

could still be used for drinking or for rinsing one’s mouth. [13] Rāhula replied that it could
not be used for such purposes, since it was dirty. The Buddha then remarked that Rāhula would be as useless as this dirty water if he did not keep his mouth restrained.
According to the Ambala��hikārāhulovāda-sutta, its Madhyama-āgama parallel, and
the Vinayavibha�ga account, the Buddha next poured out the remaining water and afterwards turned the vessel upside down, comparing someone who speaks a deliberate
lie to the discarded water, to the upside down condition of the water vessel, and to its
empty condition. [14]
The Chinese Dharmapada Avadāna account reports that, once he had thrown out the
remaining water, the Buddha pointed out that the vessel was still dirty and thus could
not be filled with water for drinking. [15] The Dharmapada Avadāna account continues
with another illustration, with the Buddha spinning the vessel around with his feet and
asking Rāhula if he was concerned that the vessel might break. Rāhula replied that the
vessel was an item of little worth, therefore he was not concerned about the possibility
that it might break. The Buddha then drew the conclusion that someone who does not
restrain body and speech is similarly held in little esteem.
The Ambala��hikārāhulovāda-sutta, its Madhyama-āgama parallel, and the Vinayavibha�ga follow the water vessel illustrations with the simile of an elephant used for warfare. [16] They describe how an elephant might fight with his whole body but keep protecting his trunk. On a later occasion, the same elephant might also use its trunk. When
that happens, the elephant trainer realizes that this elephant is ready to do anything. According to the Chinese (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinayavibha�ga and the Pāli commentary,
the elephant trainer knows this to be a sign that the elephant will defeat the enemy. [17]
This simile recurs in similar terms in the Chinese Dharmapada Avadāna account,
with, however, an opposite evaluation of its implication. [18] According to the Chinese
Dharmapada Avadāna presentation, the fact that the elephant does not even protect his
trunk and has given up concern for his life shows that he is reckless to an extent that
renders the elephant unfit for use in battle. The idea behind this could be that a reckless
elephant might cause damage to its own troops and endanger the person who rides on it.

āgama translation employ the image of an elephant that guards the different parts of its
body when engaging in battle in a positive way, comparing it to the way a monk should
guard his sense-doors. [19]
The Dharmapada Avadāna account concludes that, just as the elephant should guard
his trunk, so Rāhula should guard his mouth. Thus, while the simile of the elephant in
the Chinese Dharmapada Avadāna compares a bad quality of the elephant to a bad
quality of Rāhula, from the perspective of the Chinese (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinayavibha�ga and the Pāli commentary the simile rather employs a positive quality of a war
elephant to illustrate the blameworthy quality of speaking falsehood. Whichever evaluation is given to the elephant’s behaviour, the Pāli, Chinese, and Tibetan versions agree
that the image of an elephant that even uses its trunk illustrates the recklessness of
someone who is not ashamed to speak a lie. [20]
According to the Madhyama-āgama account and the Vinayavibha�ga, at this point
the Buddha also delivered a set of stanzas to bring home the same point. The first of
these stanzas indicates that one who speaks falsehood is capable of any evil, while according to the second stanza it would be better to swallow a hot iron ball rather than
partaking of the offerings of the faithful when one does not maintain pure moral conduct. [21] The Madhyama-āgama version continues with another two stanzas, which point

out that if one wishes to avoid dukkha, one needs to avoid unwholesome deeds, since
there is no escape from the retribution for evil deeds. [22]
The Ambala��hikārāhulovāda-sutta, its Madhyama-āgama parallel, and the Vinayavibha�ga continue by using the reflective function of a mirror to illustrate the need to reflect on the ethical quality of any bodily action before, while, and after performing the
action. [23] These three versions agree that past bodily misconduct should be confessed to
one’s elders, while a wholesome past bodily deed will lead to the arising of happiness,
followed by training oneself day and night in wholesome states. The Madhyamaāgama version and the Vinayavibha�ga specify that such training takes place in regard
to right mindfulness and clear comprehension, thereby offering a gloss on the implication of “wholesome states” in the present context. [24]
A significant difference between the Ambala��hikārāhulovāda-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel is that the Chinese discourse enjoins to refrain from a bodily action
that is “pure” and at the same time unwholesome, whereas a bodily action should be
undertaken that is “not pure”, but at the same time is wholesome and does not result in
suffering. [25] This presentation is surprising, since to qualify an action as wholesome and
at the same time as impure seems contradictory. [26]
The Vinayavibha�ga account differs from the Madhyama-āgama version in this respect, as it does not consider that an unwholesome bodily action could be pure. [27]

that is “pure”, (a character that usually translates suddhi (or śuddhi) and is rendered by Lévi 1896:
480 as “pur”), but which at the same time is unwholesome, (akusala), and results in dukkha, .
26 Minh Chau 1964/1991: 34 and 132 suggests that in this context could refer to actions that are “permissible” according to the monastic code of discipline, but which have unwholesome results, as opposed
to actions that are not permissible, but that have wholesome results. He then concludes that this instruction in [[MA14]] allows a more liberal attitude towards the interpretation of monastic regulations. Minh
Chau’s reasonable attempt to make sense out of this passage by assuming that may have a meaning
different from its more usual meaning of 住正念正智 “purity” receives support from Hirakawa 1997: 727, who lists
kalpika and kalpa as possible equivalents for, cf. also Bapat 1970: 223, who notes that the expression
akappiya in Sp II 289, 彼身業淨, 24 has as its counterpart 或自為, 或為他, 不善, in the 與苦果受, 於苦報, T 1462 at T XXIV 727c23
(on the title of 淨 this work cf. Pinte 2010, on its school affiliation Heirman 2004). A problem with Minh
Chau’s interpretation, however, is that adopting this rendering to the instruction for a past bodily action 不善 苦
in [[MA14]] at T I 436c27 would result in proposing that a 淨 “permissible” bodily deed should be confessed,
while a “not permissible” bodily deed leads to the arising of joy. Such a statement would make little
sense, since for a “permissible” bodily deed there would be no need for confession. In fact, the idea to
give precedence to others’ welfare over the requirements of moral conduct belongs to a later phase of
Buddhist thought and is not yet found in the early discourses. An extract from the present discussion 淨
already appeared in Anālayo 2008a: 10-12.

346   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


A quotation from the present discourse in the Vyākhyāyukti-�īkā, preserved in Tibetan,
and a paraphrase of the present passage in the Śrāvakabhūmi agree with the Vinayavibha�ga version and the Ambala��hikārāhulovāda-sutta that the present instructions are
to refrain from a bodily deed that is harmful and unwholesome, [28] without envisaging
that such a deed could be reckoned as pure.
Judging from the phrasing in these versions, it seems safe to conclude that with high
probability this part of the Madhyama-āgama version has suffered from an error in transmission or translation. [29]

MN I 417   When applying the same treatment to verbal and mental deeds, the Majjhima-nikāya
account instructs that, if one has committed an unwholesome mental deed, one should
feel repelled, humiliated, and disgusted. [30] The Madhyama-āgama version and the Tibetan Vinayavibha�ga use less strong terminology in this case, as they simply instruct
to discard such an unwholesome mental deed (in future). [31]

MN I 420   The Ambala��hikārāhulovāda-sutta, its Madhyama-āgama parallel, and the account
in the Vinayavibha�ga round off their exposition by declaring that recluses and Brahmins of past, present, and future times purify their bodily, verbal, and mental action in
this way.
The Madhyama-āgama version and the Vinayavibha�ga conclude by repeating the instructions to Rāhula in verse, again emphasizing the need to reflect on the ethical quality of any action. [32]

28 According to the discourse quotation in the Vyākhyāyukti-�īkā, D (4069) sems tsam, si 200b3 or Q (5570)
i 71a5, the instruction to Rāhula is to refrain from a bodily deed that is harmful, unwholesome, and results in dukkha, gnod pa dang ldan pa mi dge ba sdug bsngal ’byung ba. The Śrāvakabhūmi in Shukla
1973: 55,16 similarly reads vyābhādhika� ... ātmano vā parasya vā akuśala�, cf. also ŚSG 1998: 88,20
and the Chinese counterpart in T 1579 at T XXX 405b5: .
29 Such a textual error could have occurred due to misinterpreting a sandhi in the Indic original to imply
that a particular word has, or else does not have, the negative prefix 是不善事, 是苦惡業, 能於未來感苦異熟 a-. A similar error can be found in
the Madhyama-āgama parallel to [[MN65]] (cf. below p. 361 note 114), indicating that such mistakes did
sometimes take place; cf. also Karashima 1992: 263, who notes similar errors in Dharmarak�a’s translation of the Saddharmapu��arīka-sūtra, or Bapat 1970: lix, who points out occurrences of this type of

[[MN62]] Mahārāhulovāda-sutta

The Mahārāhulovāda-sutta, the “greater discourse on an instruction to Rāhula”, presents a set of meditation instructions given by the Buddha to his son Rāhula. This discourse has a parallel in the Ekottarika-āgama. [33]
The Mahārāhulovāda-sutta and its Ekottarika-āgama parallel begin with the Buddha
approaching Sāvatthī to collect alms, together with his son Rāhula. According to the
Majjhima-nikāya account, while they were walking on the road the Buddha turned
around and told Rāhula that he should contemplate the not-self nature of the aggregate
of form. [34] The Ekottarika-āgama discourse differs slightly, as here the Buddha told Rāhula that he should contemplate the impermanent nature of form. [35] Both versions report
that the Buddha then extended the respective instruction to cover the other four aggregates.
According to the Majjhima-nikāya version, this enlargement of the instruction was
prompted by Rāhula, who had inquired whether the contemplation, which he had just
been taught, should be applied only to form. [36]
The Pāli commentary explains that, while following the Buddha, Rāhula had been
mentally congratulating himself on having inherited the splendid appearance of his father. [37] The Buddha had become aware of these vain thoughts and decided to address
the matter right on the spot by instructing Rāhula to contemplate the true nature of material form. This sudden and unexpected instruction apparently had its effect, since according to the Mahārāhulovāda-sutta and its Ekottarika-āgama parallel Rāhula decided to forgo begging alms and right away sat down to meditate in order to put the instruction into practice. [38]
The Mahārāhulovāda-sutta continues by reporting that, while Rāhula was seated in
meditation, Sāriputta came by and told him to practise mindfulness of breathing. According to the Ekottarika-āgama presentation, however, this instruction was given by
the Buddha who, on his way back from collecting alms, had seen Rāhula seated in meditation. [39] The Ekottarika-āgama version reports that at this point the Buddha also instructed Rāhula on contemplation of impurity (asubha) and on the four brahmavihāras.
The Mahārāhulovāda-sutta and its Ekottarika-āgama parallel agree that Rāhula next
approached the Buddha and inquired about how to undertake mindfulness of breathing

33 The parallel is [[EA17.1]] at T II 581c-582c. [[EA17.1]] agrees with [[MN62]] on locating the discourse in Jeta’s
Grove by Sāvatthī. [[EA17.1]] has been translated by Huyen-Vi 1993: 213-222.
34 [[MN62]] at MN I 421,6: “all form should be seen as ‘not mine’, ‘not I’, ‘not my self’”, sabba� rūpa�, n’
eta� mama, n’ eso ’ham asmi, na me ’so attā ti ... da��habban ti.
35 [[EA17.1]] at T II 581c3: “you should now contemplate form as being impermanent”, .
36 [[MN62]] at MN I 421,8: rūpam eva nu kho, bhagavā, rūpam eva nu kho, sugatā ti?
37 Ps III 132,10.
38 [[EA17.1]] at T II 581c7 describes Rāhula’s reaction in additional detail, reporting how he reflected why
the Buddha had addressed him in this way when they were about to enter the town for alms.
39 The commentary, Ps III 136,11, explains that Sāriputta did not know that Rāhula had already received
meditation instructions from the Buddha. According to Vin I 82,16, Sāriputta had ordained Rāhula. As
Rāhula’s upajjhāya, it would be natural for him to given an instruction to Rāhula.

so that it becomes fruitful. [40] The Ekottarika-āgama version reports that the Buddha directly replied to this question by describing mindfulness of breathing. According to the
Majjhima-nikāya version, however, he replied by at first giving a detailed instruction
on contemplation of the five elements, [41] followed by taking up the brahmavihāras,
contemplation of impurity, and perception of impermanence, before turning to mindfulness of breathing. The detailed instructions on the five elements, which make up
about half of the text of the Pāli discourse, are not found at all in the Chinese version.
When evaluating this substantial difference between the two versions, it comes somewhat unexpected that the Buddha, instead of directly replying to Rāhula’s question,
should give such a detailed exposition of other types of meditation before turning to
the topic about which he had been asked, namely mindfulness of breathing. Notably, a
discourse in the A�guttara-nikāya and its parallel in the Sa�yukta-āgama record an instruction given by the Buddha to Rāhula on the four elements. [42] This leaves open the
possibility that the instructions given by the Buddha to his son Rāhula on contemplating the elements were originally associated with the occasion described in the A�guttara-nikāya and Sa�yukta-āgama, and during the course of transmission these instructions came to be added to the Mahārāhulovāda-sutta. [43]
The Pāli commentary to the Mahārāhulovāda-sutta, however, explains that the Buddha took up the subject of the elements in order to give a more detailed explanation of
his earlier instruction on contemplating the aggregate of form. [44] This commentarial
gloss would explain why the Buddha first gave a detailed exposition of the short instruction he had delivered on the road to Rāhula and only then took up the practice of
mindfulness of breathing. In fact, according to the Mahārāhulovāda-sutta it was Sāriputta, and not the Buddha, who had told Rāhula to practise mindfulness of breathing.
The Buddha had rather asked him to contemplate the true nature of the aggregate of

seem to have some distant affinity with an exchange between the Buddha and Rāhula reported in [[SN12.11]] at [[SNP335-336]]
41 [[MN62]] at MN I 421,27 to MN I 424,26. An extract from the present discussion already appeared in Anālayo 2005c: 97-98. A distinction of the five elements into internal and external manifestations occurs as
a discourse quotation in the *Mahāvibhā�ā, T 1545 at T XXVII 387c14; cf. also the Śrāvakabhūmi, Shukla
1973: 211,4 or ŚSG 2007: 72,8 and T 1579 at T XXX 430a16.
42 [[AN4.177]] at AN II 164,26 and [[SA465]] at T II 118c29. [[SA465]] differs from [[AN4.177]] in as much as it
begins with an inquiry by Rāhula on how to go beyond notions of self and conceit in regard to this body
with consciousness and all external signs ([[AN4.177]] does not report any inquiry by Rāhula). Another 云何修行安般 ... 獲大果報
difference is that [[SA465]] takes up six elements, whereas [[AN4.177]] covers only four elements. Compared to [[MN62]] the examination of the elements in [[AN4.177]] and [[SA465]] is also shorter, as they do not
list bodily manifestations of each internal element.
43 Greene 2006: 33-34 note 98 comments that “the structure of the sūtra makes far more sense in the Chinese version ... the entire section concerning the ... elements that we find in the Pāli version ... was probably a later addition”.

form, an instruction of which the exposition of contemplating the elements would indeed be a more detailed exposition.
Be that as it may, the two versions agree in recommending the development of the
four brahmavihāras as an antidote to particular unwholesome mental qualities, although
they have these recommendations at different junctions of the discourse. The two parallels present loving kindness as a remedy for aversion and compassion as a remedy for
cruelty (vihi�sā). While the Majjhima-nikāya version considers sympathetic joy to be
an antidote to discontent and equanimity an antidote to irritation (pa�igha), [45] the Ekottarika-āgama discourse instead contrasts sympathetic joy with envy and equanimity
with conceit (see table 7.1). [46]


Table 7.1: Specific Meditations as Antidotes in [[MN62]] and its Parallel

|[[MN62]]|[[EA17.1]]|
|---|---|
|loving kindness≠ aversion (1)<br>compassion≠ cruelty (2)<br>sympathetic joy≠ discontent (3)<br>equanimity≠ irritation (4)<br>impurity≠ lust (5)<br>impermanence≠ conceit ‘I am’ (6)|impurity≠ lust(→ 5)<br>loving kindness≠ aversion (→ 1)<br>compassion≠ cruelty (→ 2)<br>sympathetic joy≠ envy(→ 3)<br>equanimity≠ conceit(→ 4, 6 ?)<br>|



When evaluating this difference, the point made by the Ekottarika-āgama version’s
presentation of sympathetic joy as a remedy for envy could be that to rejoice in someone else’s good fortune would be directly opposed to sentiments of envy.
Regarding equanimity, however, the Ekottarika-āgama version appears less straightforward. Situations that arouse irritation would indeed require the establishment of
equanimity, as suggested by the Majjhima-nikāya version’s presentation, while it is
less clear why equanimity should be particularly apt for overcoming conceit. The Majjhima-nikāya version at this point also takes up the perception of impermanence to
counter the conceit ‘I am’, an instruction not found at all in the Ekottarika-āgama discourse (see table 7.1).
Perception of impermanence also features in other discourses as the appropriate
method for countering conceit. [47] This suggests that perhaps the Ekottarika-āgama ver

45 [[MN62]] at MN I 424,30. Other Pāli discourses also place sympathetic joy in contrast to discontent, cf.,
e.g., [[DN33]] at DN III 249,2, [[DN34]] at DN III 280,26, [[AN6.13]] at AN III 291,18, and [[AN6.113]] at AN III
448,6. A different nuance can be found in [[AN5.76]] at AN I 243,23, which relates sympathetic joy to the
absence of quarrelling and disputing.
46 [[EA17.1]] at T II 581c21+22.
47 [[MN122]] at MN III 115,3, [[MA191]] at T I 739b17, and their Tibetan parallel in Skilling 1994a: 240,1 indicate that contemplation of the impermanent nature of the five aggregates leads beyond the conceit ‘I
am’. [[SN22.102]] at SN III 155,14 and its parallel [[SA270]] at T II 70c3 present perception of impermanence as the tool for overcoming various defilements, one of which is conceit. [[AN9.1]] at AN IV 353,11
recommends perception of impermanence to overcome the conceit ‘I am’, a recommendation given

sion’s contrasting conceit with equanimity is the result of a textual error, conflating
what originally were two separate topics, namely equanimity as a remedy for irritation
and contemplation of impermanence as a way to counter conceit.

MN I 425   Regarding the subject of mindfulness of breathing, the two versions exhibit some interesting differences in their detailed exposition of this topic, which merit a closer examination. Both versions begin by instructing that one should retire to a secluded spot,
sit down cross-legged, and keep the body straight. The Majjhima-nikāya account at this
point recommends establishing mindfulness “in front” (parimukha), [48] an expression
that according to the explanation given in the Vibha�ga and the Pa�isambhidāmagga
refers to the nostril area as the proper location for being mindful of the breath. [49] This explanation is reflected in the Ekottarika-āgama discourse, which explicitly instructs that
one should be “keeping the mind at the tip of the nose”. [50]
The standard pericope description of sitting down for meditation in other Ekottarikaāgama discourses, however, does not mention the nose tip, but speaks just of putting
mindfulness “in front”. [51] This leaves open the possibility that the instruction to keep
the mind at the tip of the nose in the Ekottarika-āgama parallel to the Mahārāhulovāda-sutta could have been an explanatory gloss on the practice of mindfulness of breathing that, either during the period of transmission or at the time of translation, became
part of the discourse itself. [52]
The Mahārāhulovāda-sutta and its parallel begin their description of mindfulness of
breathing with awareness of the long or short nature of in-breaths and out-breaths. [53]

similarly in its parallel [[MA57]] at T I 492b25. The same recommendation recurs in [[AN9.3]] at AN IV
358,17 (= [[UD4.1]] at [[UD37.18]]) and the parallel [[MA56]] at T I 492a7.
48 [[MN62]] at MN I 425,8.
49 Vibh 252,12: “mindfulness is established, well established, at the nose tip or the upper lip, therefore it is
said: ‘having established mindfulness in front’”, sati upa��hitā hoti supa��hitā nāsikagga vā mukhanimitte vā, tena vuccati parimukha� sati� upa��hapetvā ti; cf. also Pa�is I 171,19. An alternative instruction
on the same practice can be found in T 613 at T XV 256c25, according to which the practice of mindfulness of breathing can also be undertaken by directing attention to the navel region, . The same
work, a treatise on meditation whose translation is attributed to Kumārajīva (344-413), continues by instructing to count the breaths, instructions found also in Vism 278,33.
50 [[EA17.1]] at T II 582a15: . In regard to an earlier occurrence of parimukha� sati� upa��hapetvā
in [[MN62]] at MN I 421,14, however, the parallel passage in [[EA17.1]] at T II 581c12 speaks simply of establishing unification of the mind, . Since this instance describes contemplation of the five aggregates, to direct mindfulness to the nose-tip would in fact not have suited the context.
51 E.g., in [[EA37.3]] at T II 711c19:, corresponding to parimukha� sati� upa��hapetvā in its parallel
[[MN32]] at MN I 219,30. The same expression as part of the standard description of sitting down
for meditation occurs over thirty times in the Ekottarika-āgama. In contrast, the expression to keep the
mind at the nose tip,, does not seem to recur anywhere else in the Ekottarika-āgama 意在臍中 or in the
other three main Āgamas.
52 Zürcher 1959/1972: 31 explains that “during the work of translation, and perhaps also on other occasions, the master gave oral explanations ( 繫意鼻頭 k’ou-chieh ) concerning the contents of the scriptures
translated. Explanations of this kind often appear to have crept into the text”.
53 Huyen-Vi 1993: 216 note 6 draws attention to the fact that the instructions for contemplating long and 專精一心
short breaths in [[EA17.1]] at T II 582a15 speak of doing this first in regard to the out-breath,, and

The Ekottarika-āgama version continues by instructing to be mindful of the temperature of the in-breaths and out-breaths in terms of their coolness or warmness. [54]
The Ekottarika-āgama version also directs mindfulness to the whole body, [55] an instruction found in the Majjhima-nikāya version as the third step of its scheme of sixteen stages in the practice of mindfulness of breathing. [56]
According to an explanation given in the Visuddhimagga, the expression “body”
should in the present context be understood to refer to the “body” of the breath, [57] in the
sense of directing awareness to the full extent of the breath from beginning to end. The
formulation used in the Ekottarika-āgama version, however, appears to intend the
physical body. [58]
The Ekottarika-āgama version next instructs to be aware if the breath is present or
not present. [59] Instead of directing mindfulness to the presence or absence of the breath,


then in regard to the in-breath, . [[MN62]] at MN I 425,9 directs mindfulness first to assasati and then
to passasati, although there is some divergence of opinions on how these two Pāli expressions should be
understood. Vism 272,1 states that according to the Vinaya commentary assasati represents the outbreath, whereas according to the Suttanta commentary assasati represents the in-breath. PED: 92 s.v. ā [1]
comments that assasati and passasati “in exegesis ... have been differentiated in a way which looks like
a distortion of the original meaning, viz. assasati is taken as ‘breathing out’, passasati as ‘breathing in’”.
Childers 1875/1993: 61, DP I: 268, and CPD I: 523 (all s.v. assasati) take assasati to mean “to breathe
in”, but according to Böhtlingk 1883/1998d: 173, Mylius 1997: 250, and MW: 696 (s.v. praśvāsa or
passasati), “to breath in” is rather represented by passasati or praśvasati; cf. also Caland 1931: 62 note
1 on the possible influence of the law of waxing syllables on the sequence of terms in the dvanda compound prā�āpānau. BHSD: 110 s.v. 入息 āśvāsa-praśvāsa, remarks that “whatever may have been the meaning of the two terms, it seems clear that the compound (like ānāpāna) was commonly used in the sense
of breath, collectively and as a whole”.
54 [[EA17.1]] at T II 582a17: and . The point behind this instruction could be related to the circumstance
that out-breaths will be slightly warmer than in-breaths, hence attention given to this difference in temperature would be a way of developing distinct awareness of in-breaths as against out-breaths; on this
instruction cf. also the, T 1507 at T XXV 49c3.
55 [[EA17.1]] at T II 582b1: “completely contemplate the physical body [when] breathing in, [when] breathing out, coming to know it entirely”, .
56 [[MN62]] at MN I 425,14: “he trains: ‘experiencing the whole body I breathe in ... breathe out’”, sabbakāyapa�isa�vedī assasissāmī ti ... passasissāmī ti sikkhati (B [e] -MN II 88,17: sabbakāyappa�isa�vedī).
57 Vism 273,24. In fact [[MN118]] at MN III 83,31 identifies in- and out-breaths as “a body among bodies”,
kāyesu kāyaññatarāha� ... vadāmi yadida� assāsapassāsa� (B [e] -MN III 126,11 and C [e] -MN III 230,18:
assāsapassāsā). On this 冷 interpretation, 暖 the instruction to be aware of the ‘body’ of the breath in its whole
length would intend a strengthening and further enhancement in the continuity of awareness. Bodhi
2005: 442 note 29 remarks that the commentarial interpretation of sabbakāyapa�isa�vedī as intending
awareness of the beginning, middle, and end of the breaths 分別功德論 “is difficult to square with the literal words
of the original text, which may have originally intended simply a global awareness of the entire body. It
is also difficult to see how -pa�isa�vedī 盡觀身體入息, could mean ‘is aware of’; this suffix is based on the verb 出息, 皆悉知之 pa�isa�vedeti meaning ‘to experience’ or ‘to feel’, which has a different nuance from ‘awareness’”.
58 [[EA17.1]] at T II 582b2 uses the expression, whereas for a figurative sense of kāya, simply would
have been the appropriate choice.

the Mahārāhulovāda-sutta speaks of tranquillising the bodily formation. [60] Since in
other discourses the expression “bodily formation” refers to in- and out-breathing, [61] the
instruction given in the Pāli version could be similar in meaning to what is described in
the Chinese version.
The Mahārāhulovāda-sutta continues by directing the development of mindfulness
of breathing to a range of phenomena with the help of twelve other steps of practice. [62]
Its Ekottarika-āgama parallel, however, has only one more step of practice at this point,
which instructs to be aware if the breath comes “from the heart”. [63]
Both versions conclude their respective expositions of mindfulness of breathing by
proclaiming that such practice is of great fruit and benefit. The Majjhima-nikāya version indicates that, if mindfulness of breathing is practised well, even one’s last breaths
will be with mindfulness. [64] The Ekottarika-āgama version highlights that properly practising mindfulness of breathing leads to experiencing the taste of the deathless. [65]

MN I 426   The Majjhima-nikāya version concludes with the delighted reaction of Rāhula. The
Ekottarika-āgama version continues by describing how Rāhula put the instructions re

this instruction could be either to notice the gaps between in-breaths and out-breaths (as well as between
out-breaths and in-breaths), or else the point might be that during the more deeply concentrated stages
of mindfulness of breathing the breath becomes increasingly subtle, until a meditator may no longer feel
it. Vism 283,16 offers a detailed examination of this phenomenon, explaining that once the breath disappears one should not get up and leave, believing that now the meditation is over.
60 [[MN62]] at MN I 425,15: passambhaya� kāyasa�khāra�. According to [[DN32]] at DN III 270,23 and [[AN10.20]] at AN V 31,27, with the attainment of the fourth jhāna the bodily formation has been fully tranquilized, a stage of practice where according to [[SN36.11]] at SN IV 217,8 the breath totally disappears.
61 [[SN41.6]] at SN IV 293,15: assāsapassāsā ... kāyasa�khāro, and its counterpart [[SA568]] at T II 150a24:
. This need not be interpreted as an exclusive identification, cf. Griffiths 1986/1991:
148 note 17, who comments that “it seems more likely ... that we are supposed to regard the process of
respiration (assāsapassāsa) as an example of physical activity rather than an exhaustive account of it”;
cf. also Jayatilleke 1948: 217 and Kapani 1992: 199-200.
62 The same scheme of sixteen steps recurs in [[MN118]] and its parallel [[SA815]] cf. below p. 666. Another
parallel to these instructions can be found in Sanskrit fragments of a text containing meditation instructions, the so-called Yogalehrbuch, cf. Schlingloff 1964: 65-68.
63 [[EA17.1]] at T II 582a20: “if the breathing comes out from the heart, he knows ‘it comes out from the
heart’; if the breathing comes in from the heart, he knows ‘it comes in from the heart’”,
. This instruction might imply to become aware of the
出息入息名為身行 breath in the chest area. Huyen-Vi 1993: 217 alternatively translates “in the event of breathing out conditioned by the mind, he is fully aware of it; and in the event of breathing in conditioned by the mind, he
is again fully aware of it”. Huyen-Vi thus appears to take the instruction to imply becoming aware of the
interrelationship of mind and breath at this point, based on a free rendering of . The same character
usually means “to follow” and “from”, cf. Mathews 1963: 1019 and Soothill 1937/2000: 349. Hirakawa
1997: 453 gives the following equivalents for : anu-√gam, upādāya; tatas, prabh�ti; -agre�a, adhīna,
anantaram, anu-√bandh, anuvicāra, antikāt, ārabhya, itas, -tas, prabhāvita, sakāśāt, santikāt, none of
which would support the rendering “conditioned by”.

ceived into practice and developed the four jhānas as well as the three higher knowledges. He then went to the Buddha to proclaim his achievement, which the Buddha approved, followed by declaring Rāhula to be foremost among disciples who uphold the
rules. [66]
While the listing of eminent disciples in the A�guttara-nikāya somewhat similarly
considers Rāhula outstanding for his willingness to be trained, [67] his full awakening is
associated in the Pāli discourses with another occasion. This occasion is recorded in the
Cū�arāhulovāda-sutta of the Majjhima-nikāya, which, judging from its title, would be
a counterpart to the present discourse, the Mahārāhulovāda-sutta. According to the
Cū�arāhulovāda-sutta and its Sa�yukta-āgama parallel, Rāhula became an arahant after
receiving an instruction by the Buddha on the development of insight in regard to the
six sense-spheres. [68]


[[MN63]] Cū�amālu�kya-sutta [69]

The Cū�amālu�kya-sutta, the “lesser discourse to Mālu�kya[putta]”, records the Buddha’s refusal to answer any of the metaphysical questions in vogue in ancient India, illustrating the pointlessness of these questions with the simile of the poisoned arrow.
This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama and in an individual translation. [70] Parts of this discourse have also been preserved as a discourse quotation in the
*Mahāprajñāpāramitā-(upadeśa-)śāstra. [71]
The Cū�amālu�kya-sutta and its parallels describe in similar terms how the monk
Mālu�kyaputta, [72] after approaching the Buddha, requested to be given an answer to a
set of metaphysical questions frequently debated in ancient India. [73] According to the
report given in all versions, Mālu�kyaputta was apparently so obsessed with these
questions that he had planned to disrobe in case the Buddha would not give him an answer. The Majjhima-nikāya version and the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-(upadeśa-)śāstra

indicate that Mālu�kyaputta even went so far as to give vent to this plan in the presence
of the Buddha. [74]

MN I 428   All versions report that the Buddha rebuked Mālu�kyaputta, pointing out that he had
never promised to provide an answer to such questions. The Buddha explained that, if
one were to make one’s going forth dependent on being given an answer to these questions, one will pass away without receiving such an answer. [75]

MN I 429   The four versions illustrate this situation with the example of a man struck by a poisonous arrow, who refuses to let the arrow be pulled out unless he is informed about
various irrelevant details concerning the archer, the bow used for shooting the arrow,
etc. [76] Querying in this way, the victim will die before his questions have been answered.

MN I 430   According to the Cū�amālu�kya-sutta and its Chinese discourse parallels, the Buddha
explained that to live the holy life under him is not compatible with holding these different views. [77] Independent of the various positions proposed by these views, there is
dukkha, manifesting as birth, old age, and death, etc. The three discourses conclude by
highlighting that instead of answering such questions the Buddha had taught the four
noble truths, as these are beneficial and lead to Nirvā�a. [78]
The stern reply Mālu�kyaputta received from the Buddha seems to have had its effect, since he apparently not only continued to live the life of a Buddhist monk instead
of disrobing, but according to a discourse found in the Sa�yutta-nikāya and its Sa�

75 Edgerton 1959: 82 explains that the “speculative, metaphysical questions put by Mālu�kāputta are simply irrelevant to all the Buddha’s teaching”. Holder 1996: 450 similarly notes that these questions are
set aside “because they have no utility”. King 1983: 263 comments that “theorizing about ontological
metaphysical ultimates has absolutely no place in the Buddhist Dharma”; cf. also Mizuno 1969: 90 and
Organ 1954: 138, who points out that “the Buddha’s reply is a pragmatic reply ... he has come to show
men how to overcome ... suffering ... anything which does not contribute to that end is extraneous”. Rigopoulos 1992/1993: 250 sums up: “the rejection of the avyākatāni is ... motivated by their ... uselessness. If I am hit by an arrow ... my only concern will be to remove it”.

[[MA221]] at T I 805a25 explains that “for the sake of this view, to practise the holy life under me, that is not
possible”, . According to T 94 at T I 918a27, the Buddha declared
that “[for one who] has this wrong view, it is not fitting to practise the holy life under me”,

he eventually became an arahant. [79]


[[MN64]] Mahāmālu�kya-sutta [80]

The Mahāmālu�kya-sutta, the “greater discourse to Mālu�kya[putta]”, presents an
exposition by the Buddha on the five lower fetters and on the way to abandon them.
This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama, [81] and also a partial parallel in
Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya, extant in Tibetan. [82] A few
sections of a version of this discourse have also been preserved in Sanskrit fragments. [83]
The Mahāmālu�kya-sutta and its Chinese and Tibetan parallels begin by reporting
that the Buddha asked his disciples if they remembered the five lower fetters. The three
versions agree that the monk Mālu�kyaputta replied by listing the five, [84] although they
differ on the sequence in which he listed them (see table 7.2). [85]
Even though the five items, listed by Mālu�kyaputta, correspond to the mental obstructions that are elsewhere reckoned as the ‘five lower fetters’, his reply met with the
Buddha’s disapproval. According to the commentarial explanation, the problem with
Mālu�kyaputta’s presentation was that he assumed bondage to occur only when these
states were actually present in the mind. [86]
To reveal the mistakenness of this assumption, the Buddha brought up the simile of a
tender infant. The simile indicates that a tender infant already has the underlying ten

, and agrees with [[MN64]] on locating the discourse in Jeta’s Grove by Sāvatthī. For remarks on

A discourse quotation from

dency to these five fetters, even though none of the corresponding mental states manifests in its mind.

MN I 434   The three versions illustrate the futility of an attempt to eradicate the five lower fetters without undertaking the path required for such eradication with the example of a
man who attempts to cut the heartwood of a tree without first cutting the bark. The
question of what constitutes this path emerges in a slightly different light in the three
versions (the discourse quotation in Śamathadeva’s commentary does not cover the
whole of the relevant section), as their otherwise similar expositions follow a different
sequence (see table 7.3).
As a result of this difference in sequence, while the Majjhima-nikāya version answers
the question about the path to the eradication of the five lower fetters by presenting the
development of jhāna and its insightful contemplation, the Madhyama-āgama and Tibetan version’s reply to the same question speaks of no longer being overwhelmed by
the five lower fetters and knowing how to get out of their manifestations. The Madhyama-āgama version also turns to the jhānas and their insightful contemplation, thus it
evidently also consider this to be of central importance (this part is no longer covered
in the quotation extract preserved in Tibetan). However, its examination of jhāna and
insight are more closely related to a simile (found also in the Majjhima-nikāya version),
which illustrates the predicament of not feeling inspired by the goal of cessation with
the image of a weak man who attempts to swim across the river Ganges in high water. [87]

MN I 435   The Mahāmālu�kya-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel introduce the development of the jhānas by mentioning the detachment and mental seclusion that forms the
precondition for jhāna development. [88]
The Madhyama-āgama version precedes its exposition of the jhānas with another
simile, not found in the Majjhima-nikāya version. This simile describes a man who
constructs a raft in order to cross a mountain river. [89] The implications of this image appear to be that detachment and mental seclusion are like gathering twigs and branches
for the construction of a raft, attaining the jhānas corresponds to the raft itself, and the

subsequent development of insight would be equivalent to crossing the river with the
help of this raft.

The Mahāmālu�kya-sutta presents the development of insight in regard to a jhāna attainment in detail, indicating that the jhāna experience should be analysed with the help
of the scheme of the five aggregates and then contemplated from a variety of perspectives. [90] The Madhyama-āgama version does not employ the aggregate scheme. Instead,
it directs the development of insight to contemplating the rise and fall of the jhāna experience. [91] Both versions apply their respective development of insight to the four jhānas and to the first three of the four immaterial attainments.
While the Majjhima-nikāya version envisages either full awakening or else non-return as a result of the insight developed in regard to each of these concentration attainments, its Madhyama-āgama parallel speaks of either full awakening or else attaining a
higher concentrative attainment in the series. [92]
This presentation thus appears to imply that, if the attempt to reach awakening based
on a lower concentrative attainment has not been successful, the meditator should de
90 [[MN64]] at MN I 435,34 instructs to contemplate each aggregate aspect of a jhāna as “impermanent, unsatisfactory, a disease, a tumour, an arrow, a calamity, an affliction, alien, disintegrating, empty, and
not-self”, aniccato dukkhato rogato ga��ato sallato aghato ābādhato parato palokato suññato anattato.
91 [[MA205]] at T I 779c19: . When it comes to the attainment of nothingness, [[MA205]] at T I 780a18
depicts a more detailed development of insight. This more detailed exposition begins by taking up pleasant, painful, and neutral feelings. Since with the attainment of the sphere of nothingness pleasant and
painful feelings have long been left behind, the instruction given here could be intended as a general
statement applicable to all previously mentioned jhāna experiences. The development of insight described at this point instructs to contemplate the feelings of jhāna in terms of impermanence, rise and
fall, dispassion, cessation, eradication, and abandoning,
. Another difference between the two versions is that [[MN64]] at MN I 435,35, etc., instructs to turn
the mind away from each jhāna or immaterial attainment and direct it to the deathless element, while
[[MA205]] has a comparable treatment only at T I 780a21, in relation to the attainment of nothingness,
whose insightful contemplation leads to not grasping at the world, which results in freedom from fear 興衰
and in turn leads to realizing Nirvā�a. [[MA205]] at T I 780a23 then illustrates such contemplation with
the example of someone who cuts up a plantain tree without finding any heartwood in it.

velop the next higher concentrative attainment and then use that as a basis for destroying the influxes. [93]

MN I 437   According to both versions, Ānanda expressed his appreciation of the Buddha’s exposition, followed by posing a question. In the Majjhima-nikāya version, the question
he asked was why some monks were liberated by mind and others liberated through
wisdom, to which the Buddha replied that this was due to differences in their faculties
(indriyavemattatā). [94] In the Madhyama-āgama version, the question was why only some
monks quickly reach the highest attainment, to which the Buddha replied by relating
this to their different dispositions. [95]


[[MN65]] Bhaddāli-sutta

The Bhaddāli-sutta, the “discourse to Bhaddāli”, records the Buddha admonishing a
monk who was unwilling to follow the regulation to eat only once a day. This discourse
has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama and a partial parallel in the Ekottarika-āgama. [96]
Part of the instructions to eat only once a day have also been preserved in a Sanskrit
fragment, [97] and a description of how Bhaddāli refused for three months to follow these
instructions can be found in the Mahāsā�ghika Vinaya. [98]

MN I 437   The Bhaddāli-sutta and its parallels begin with the Buddha’s instruction to the monks
that they should partake of a single meal per day. The Majjhima-nikāya and Madhyama-āgama versions report that the monk Bhaddāli publicly refused to follow this injunction, explaining that he would feel worried if he were to undertake such a practice. [99] The Pāli commentary explains that Bhaddāli was worried whether under such
conditions he would be able to live as a monk for his whole life. [100] According to the


93 Schmithausen 1981: 224 note 89.
94 [[MN64]] at MN I 437,8: kiñcarahi idh’ ekacce bhikkhū cetovimuttino ekacce paññāvimuttino ti (Be-MN
II 100,16, C [e] -MN II 172,2, and S [e] -MN II 162,6 have bhikkhū also after the second ekacce).
95 [[MA205]] at T I 780b6+10: “but [why] do all monks not quickly attain the unsurpassable [goal]”,
?, to which the Buddha replies: “people possess excellence in accordance to [their]
past, [their respective] practice of the path is consequently refined [or] gross”,
(my rendering of this passage is based on taking to stand for yathā-paurā�am, cf. Hirakawa 1997: 349).
96 The parallel is [[MA194]] at T I 746b-749b, while the partial parallel is [[EA49.7]] at T II 800b-801c. [[MA194]] and [[EA49.7]] agree with [[MN65]] on locating the discourse in Jeta’s Grove by Sāvatthī. [[MA194]] also
agrees with [[MN65]] on taking the protagonist of the discourse as its title, rendered as, bat da
γwa li [h] (following Pulleyblank 1991: 27, 122, 188, and 314). [[EA49.7]] at T II 800c1 also employs a
four-syllable rendering for the name of this monk, reading, bat dεj ba la (following Pulleyblank 1991: 27, 203, 241, and 304). On [[MA194]] cf. also Minh Chau 1964/1991: 180-181. 然諸

Ekottarika-āgama version, however, he simply objected that by undertaking this practice he would become weak, [101] and according to the Mahāsā�ghika Vinaya he told the
Buddha that he would feel at ease only if he could eat morning and evening. [102]
The parallel versions agree that Bhaddāli was not willing to settle for a compromise
suggested by the Buddha, according to which he could take some food along from his
meal and take that at a later time. [103] Bhaddāli kept up this recalcitrant attitude for the
whole three-month period of the rains retreat, at the completion of which other monks
(or else according to the Ekottarika-āgama account Ānanda) prompted him to approach
the Buddha and confess his transgression. [104]
According to the Majjhima-nikāya and the Madhyama-āgama versions, the Buddha
drew Bhaddāli’s attention to the circumstance that, when he had refused to follow the
Buddha’s instruction, he had not taken into account that this refusal would become
known among other monks and nuns, among the laity, and among other recluses and
Brahmins residing in Sāvatthī. [105]
The Ekottarika-āgama presentation differs, as it reports another event related to a
different monk, paralleling events described in the La�ukikopama-sutta. [106] Thus this
Ekottarika-āgama discourse appears to conflate what in the Majjhima-nikāya and the
Madhyama-āgama are two different occasions. [107] At a later point, the Ekottarika-āgama discourse returns to the Bhaddāli incident, reporting that the Buddha gave him an
exhortation in prose and in verse, in which he recommended the development of con

102 T 1425 at T XXII 359b14:, thus directly taking up the Buddha’s suggestion that
by eating only once the monks will feel at ease, T 1425 at T XXII 359b12: .
This refusal reminds of how, according to [[MN70]] at MN I 474,2 and [[MA195]] at T I 749c27, another
group of monks refused to follow the regulation on the proper time for partaking of food.
103 [[MN65]] at MN I 438,1, [[MA194]] at T I 746c3, [[EA49.7]] at T II 800c4, and T 1425 at T XXII 359b17. According to [[MA194]] and T 1425, the Buddha repeated his instruction on taking a single meal three times,
but Bhaddāli kept on refusing to follow suit.
104 His confession and the subsequent events are not recorded in the Mahāsā�ghika Vinaya. For a study of
the formula used for confession and the standard reply given by the Buddha in Pāli texts cf. Attwood
2008. 氣力弱劣
105 [[MN65]] at MN I 438,33 also mentions that the Buddha himself would have been aware of the fact that 我朝暮食者乃得安樂
Bhaddāli was not following the training, a circumstance not noted in [[MA194]] 汝等亦應一食 ... 得安樂住
106 [[EA49.7]] at T II 800c7-801b16 narrates how on another occasion the monk Udāyī had gone begging on a
rainy night and so startled a pregnant woman that she had a miscarriage (cf. the similar story in [[MN66]]
and [[MA192]]). This accident caused people to criticize the Buddhist monks. On hearing this criticism,
the Buddha called the monks together and recommended eating a single meal as a way of life that is
conducive to the development of concentration and to insight into the four noble truths. This part of [[EA49.7]] concludes with the Buddha recommending some of the ascetic practices and praising Mahākassapa’s conduct, after which [[EA49.7]] returns to the events concerning Bhaddāli, namely by reporting that
Bhaddāli had not seen the Buddha for three months, followed by Ānanda’s intervention and Bhaddāli’s
confession.
107 That this is indeed a case of conflation becomes evident in [[EA49.7]] at T II 801c5, where a short sentence with an exhortation to develop contentment is addressed to Bhaddāli,, but ends by telling Upāli,, that he should train himself in this way.

tentment. According to the Ekottarika-āgama account, Bhaddāli thereon retired into
seclusion for intensive practice and became an arahant. [108]

MN I 439 The Majjhima-nikāya and the Madhyama-āgama versions instead contrast Bhaddāli’s disobedience with the obedience of the seven types of noble disciple in regard to
the Buddha’s directives. The two versions illustrate the willingness of these noble disciples to follow the Buddha’s instructions by describing that they would even lie down
in the mud if asked to do so. [109]

MN I 440  After accepting Bhaddāli’s confession, according to both versions the Buddha described how a monk might retire into seclusion for intensive meditation without establishing the proper foundation for such secluded practice by fulfilling the training. The
two versions agree that such a monk would be unable to reach any attainment due to
being censured by his teacher, by his companions, by the gods, and by himself. The
Madhyama-āgama version explains that, due to being censured by others, such a monk
will be unable to arouse joy, which in turn prevents him from developing tranquillity,
happiness, and concentration. [110] Being without concentration, he will not be able to
know and see things as they truly are.
The two versions contrast this case with a monk who, by observing the training rules
and retiring into seclusion, is able to develop the four jhānas and the three higher
knowledges. The Majjhima-nikāya version makes a point of highlighting that each of
these attainments is the fruit of having fulfilled the training. [111] The Madhyama-āgama
version instead presents each jhāna as a higher state of mind that provides a pleasant
abiding at present and is conducive to Nirvā�a, [112] followed by introducing the three
higher knowledges as realizations that arouse knowledge and eradicate ignorance. [113]

MN I 442  According to the Bhaddāli-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel, Bhaddāli inquired why only some monks were repeatedly admonished and dealt with by their
companions. In reply, the Buddha took up the case of a monk who has committed several offences, explaining that the extent to which such a monk will be repeatedly admonished depends on whether he is obstinate and displays anger, instead of being submissive and obedient. [114]


108 [[EA49.7]] at T II 801c10.
109 While in [[MN65]] at MN I 439,26 the point is to lie in the mud as a plank for the Buddha (to walk over),
ehi me tva� bhikkhu pa�ke sa�kamo hohī ti (S [e] -MN II 166,14: hotī ti), [[MA194]] at T I 747a28 speaks
only of lying down in the mud,, without indicating that this is done in order to become a plank
for the Buddha.

monk who prevaricates and displays anger says that he will act in such a way that it pleases the Sa�gha and meets with their approval, and he also has the intention to act in such a manner,
來入泥, while the monk who does not prevaricate and displays no anger

Chapter 7 Bhikkhu-vagga                                      -  361


Both versions repeat the same explanation for the case of a monk who has committed
only few offences, [115] followed by comparing a monk who has but a small amount of
faith to a man who has already lost one eye, due to which his friends and relatives will
do what they can to protect him, so that he will not lose the other eye as well. [116] Similarly, other monks will not admonish such a monk in order to avoid that this monk loses
the little faith he has.
The Majjhima-nikāya version continues by reporting that Bhaddāli asked why formerly there were fewer rules and more monks were established in final knowledge,
whereas at present there are many rules and only few monks are established in final
knowledge. [117]
The corresponding question in the Madhyama-āgama version differs in that it does
not take up the issue of being established in final knowledge. Instead, it contrasts earlier times, when many monks respectfully observed the relatively few rules, with present times, where there are many rules and only a smaller number of monks observe
them respectfully. [118] The two versions agree in attributing this development to the growth
of the monastic community in various respects (see table 7.4). [119]


neither says that he will act nor wants to act in such a way that it pleases the Sa�gha and meets with
their approval, . This appears to be a textual error,
similar in type to the error noted above p. 346 note 29.
115 While [[MN65]] at MN I 443,22 gives this case in full, [[MA194]] at T I 748c22 has the same only in an abbreviated manner.
116 [[MN65]] at MN I 444,22 and [[MA194]] at T I 748c27.
117 [[MN65]] at MN I 444,36. Bhaddāli’s question recurs as a question posed by Mahākassapa in [[SN16.13]] at
SN II 224,2, in which case the parallel [[SA906]] at T II 226b28 contrasts the time of few rules and many
monks, whose mind delighted in the practice, with the time of many rules and few monks delighting in
the practice; cf. also SĀ [2] 121 at T II 419b18.
118 [[MA194]] at T I 749a10: “formerly, when few rules had been promulgated, many were the monks who
observed and upheld [them] ... nowadays many rules have been promulgated, [yet] few are the monks 不如是說, 我今當作令眾歡喜而可意, 不作如是意
who observe and uphold [them]”, ...
. Thus Bhaddāli’s question in [[MA194]] appears less challenging than in [[MN65]] In fact, in [[MA194]] his attitude throughout is more respectful than in [[MN65]] While in [[MN65]] Bhaddāli simply poses
his queries, according to [[MA194]] each time Bhaddāli gets up, arranges his robe over one shoulder and
puts his hands together [in respect], before asking the Buddha a question, cf. [[MA194]] at T I 746b26, T I
746c11, T I 748b23, T I 749a9, and T I 749b5. The description of such respectful behaviour is a frequently recurring pericope in the Madhyama-āgama, however, so that its occurrence in the present context may not bear a particular relation to Bhaddāli’s attitude.

(B [e] -MN II 108,26 and S [e] -MN II 175,4: āsava��hānīyā), as the reason for the promulgation of rules, [[MA194]] at T I 749a14 speaks repeatedly 昔日少施設戒, of, literally 多有比丘遵奉持者 “likeable things” (adopting 今日多施設戒, the variant 少有比丘遵 read奉持者 ing instead of, a variation that would not affect the meaning of the phrase). Elsewhere in the
Madhyama-āgama, e.g., in [[MA194]] at T I 748b15, influx is translated with, a translation also used at
the end of the present passage in [[MA194]] at T I 749a20. This makes it improbable that could be a
translation error, mistaking “influx”, āsava or āśrava/āsrava, for “enjoyment”, assāda or āsvada.
Could be a gloss by the translator(s) on the implication of an expression similar in meaning to
āsava��hāniyā dhammā?

MN I 445   The Bhaddāli-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel next turn to the simile of the
horse, a simile already delivered by the Buddha on a former occasion, although at that
time Bhaddāli did not pay proper attention. [121] This simile describes the gradual training
of a horse and compares a well-trained horse, worthy of a king, to a monk who possesses the ten path factors of one who is beyond training (asekha). [122] They conclude
with Bhaddāli’s delight in the exposition he had received.


[[MN66]] La�ukikopama-sutta [123]

The La�ukikopama-sutta, the “discourse on the simile of the quail”, highlights the importance of overcoming all fetters. This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama. [124]

MN I 447   The protagonist of the La�ukikopama-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel is a
monk by the name of Udāyī, [125] who according to both versions approached the Buddha
and expressed his appreciation of the Buddha’s injunction to abstain from taking a meal


120 [[MN65]] at MN I 445,14 and [[MA194]] at T I 749a13. Notably, an examination of the same topic in Vin III
9,35 has a somewhat different listing, comprising great seniority, great development, great gains, and
great learning.
121 [[MN65]] at MN I 445,26 and [[MA194]] at T I 749b2. This simile recurs in [[MN107]] at MN III 2,3.
122 [[MA194]] at T I 749b22 differs from [[MN65]] at MN I 447,2 on the sequence of the ten path factors in as
much as it has right knowledge as its last factor. For an examination of this type of difference cf. below
p. 663.
123 Se-MN II 179,1 has the title La�ukikopama-sutta.
124 The parallel is [[MA192]] at T I 740c-744a, which has the title “discourse to Kā�udāyī”,,
and which agrees with [[MN66]] on locating the discourse in Āpa�a. On [[MA192]] cf. also Minh Chau
1964/1991: 65. For a discourse quotation in Abhidh-k-� cf. below note 144.
125 The protagonist of [[MA192]] at T I 740c26 is, “venerable Udāyī”, further qualified in the title of the discourse to be “Kā�udāyī”, . According to Th-a II 221,7, Kā�udāyī was one of the
ministers of the Buddha’s father, sent by the latter to invite the recently awakened Buddha to Kapilavatthu, a mission during which Kā�udāyī went forth and became an arahant, cf. also the account given
in the Mahāvastu in Basak 1965: 325,7 or in Senart 1890: 233,11, and again in Basak 1968/2004: 55,10
or in Senart 1897: 91,10. The Mahāsā�ghika Vinaya, T 1425 at T XXII 359b26, refers to the present
discourse as the “discourse on Kā�udāyī”, . Similarly, the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, T 1428
at T XXII 662b17, and the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya, T 1421 at T XXII 54a10, identify the protagonist of an 加樓烏陀夷經
event recorded in the present discourse as Udāyī “the dark”, thereby agreeing on his identity with [[MA192]]

during the afternoon or at night. [126] Udāyī contrasted his present appreciation with the
discontent he experienced at the time when the Buddha had promulgated the regulation
to abstain from eating in the afternoon, and when the Buddha later on also told the
monks to refrain from partaking of food at night as well. [127]
In both versions, Udāyī described various misfortunes met with by monks who went
seeking for food at night. One of these misfortunes happened on a stormy night, when
during a flash of lightning a woman suddenly saw a monk searching for alms and was
thoroughly terrified, believing him to be an evil spirit. [128] The same event is recorded in

126 A minor difference between the two versions is that, according to [[MA192]] at T I 741a4, the Buddha
asked Udāyī if he felt satisfied and was not lacking anything, in reply to which Udāyī reported his present satisfaction, while according to [[MN66]] at MN I 448,3 Udāyī came out with his reflection without
being prompted to do so by an inquiry by the Buddha. A passage similar to Udāyī’s reflection in [[MN66]] at MN I 447,23 on how the Buddha had helped him to overcome unwholesome states occurs in fragment SHT I 186b (p. 105). A discourse quotation with Udāyī expressing his appreciation of the Buddha’s instructions can be found in the *Mahāvibhā�ā, T 1545 at T XXVII 151b6.
127 Bodhi in Ñā�amoli 1995/2005: 1270 note 671 points out that Vin IV 85,9, concerning pācittiya rule 37
on abstaining from taking food during the period from noon until next day’s dawn, does not mention
such a successive prohibition. Nor is such a successive prohibition mentioned in the account of the corresponding pātayantika rule 37 in the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, T 1428 at T XXII 662c8, rule 37 in the
Kāśyapīya Vinaya, T 1460 at T XXIV 662c16, rule 36 in the Mahāsā�ghika Vinaya, T 1425 at T XXII
359c2 (T 1425 at T XXII 359b21 does report a successive prohibition, which, however, proceeds from
the prohibition of begging at the wrong time to prohibiting the partaking of food at the wrong time),
rule 38 in the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya, T 1421 at T XXII 54a19, rule 37 in the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya,
T 1442 at T XXIII 824c13, and rule 37 in the Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, T 1435 at T XXIII 95b14. The fact
that such a successive prohibition is not mentioned in the various Vinayas need not contradict the La�ukikopama-sutta’s presentation, since the promulgation of the Vinaya rule could have taken place after
two successive instructions had been given earlier on abstaining from afternoon and evening meals.
This much could be inferred from the fact that according to the Theravāda, (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda, and
Sarvāstivāda Vinaya accounts the group of seventeen, who according to these three Vinayas occasioned
this rule, were rebuked by other monks for taking food at the “wrong time”, vikāla/ . The way this
rebuke is formulated suggests that at the time of this event it was already customary for monks not to
take food during time periods reckoned to be the “wrong time”. According to the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda
Vinaya account, T 1442 at T XXIII 824c7, the group of seventeen (which Vin IV 128,27 and Vin IV
148,30 indicate to have been a group of young boys), admitted that they had partaken of food at the
wrong time, explaining that they had done so because they had not received food before noon and therefore had been very hungry, so that when someone offered them food after noon they ate it. This suggests
that the group of seventeen and the other monks were well aware of the fact that it was not appropriate
to partake of food at such a time, but the group of seventeen had evidently not taken this regulation seriously enough. Thus, perhaps at first there was simply an informal injunction to stop eating at certain
times, as reported in the La�ukikopama-sutta, and when some monks nevertheless ate at what by then 非時
had become ‘the wrong time’, a formal Vinaya regulation addressing the issue was promulgated; cf.
also Voyce 1983: 311-312. By presenting eating at the wrong time as a pācittiya or pātayantika offence, the Vinaya regulation also indicates that eating at the wrong time should be considered a more
serious offence than other aspects of conduct, such as those covered in the sekhiya or śaik�a rules.
Prasad 1972a: 122 notes that partaking of food at night was also not allowable for Jain monastics.
128 While [[MA192]] at T I 741b9 does not identify this monk and refers to him simply as “a monk”,,
according to [[MN66]] at MN I 448,33 this monk was Udāyī himself.

an Ekottarika-āgama discourse and in the Dharmaguptaka and Mahīśāsaka Vinayas,
which indicate that the woman had been pregnant and lost her child due to the fright
she experienced. [129]
According to the Ekottarika-āgama version’s presentation, it was this woman’s mishap that motivated the Buddha to promulgate the regulation about taking only a single
meal per day. [130] In the Dharmaguptaka and the Mahīśāsaka Vinayas, however, the present event caused the Buddha to promulgate a rule on abstaining from eating at the
wrong time, a regulation that could be observed without needing to take only a single
meal. [131]
The Mahāsā�ghika Vinaya does not associate the story of the frightened woman to a
ruling on partaking of food only once or only at the right time, but rather presents the
same event as the reason for the Buddha to lay down a regulation about not going begging at the wrong time. [132] Although the present accident also has a bearing on regulations about the time of partaking food, the Mahāsā�ghika Vinaya seems to offer the
most straightforward reaction to this particular event, since it was the nocturnal alms
round that had caused the woman’s fright.

MN I 449   According to the La�ukikopama-sutta, the frightened woman made a rather cryptic
remark, exclaiming that the mother and father of this monk have died. [133] As it stands in
the Majjhima-nikāya version, this remark is not easily intelligible. According to the
commentary, the intended meaning is that, had the monk’s parents been still alive, he
would not need to go in search for food during the night. [134]
In the Madhyama-āgama version, the reference to the monk’s parents comes as part
of a set of curses spoken by the frightened woman, in which she expresses her anger by
wishing that the life of this monk may come to an end, that his mother and father may
pass away, and that his whole clan may meet with destruction. [135] Thus, from the per

identifies this monk as Kā�udāyī,, and explains that it was his dark skin colour that had made
the woman mistake him for an evil spirit. Another occurrence of the motif of a monk frightening a pregnant woman and thereby causing an abortion, can be found in the, T 129 at T II 845a8
(cf. also Lévi 1916: 264 or Strong 1979: 74).

had been undertaken by Buddhas and their disciples of the past and will be undertaken by Buddhas and
their disciples of the future, being a form of practice conducive to concentration and insight into the four
noble truths. According to [[EA49.7]] at T II 801a23, the Buddha had not yet pronounced this regulation,
as he was awaiting a suitable occasion to do so, such as the present accident.

spective of the Madhyama-āgama account, the reference to the death of the monk’s
parents was part of a curse spoken by the frightened woman, a presentation that seems
to fit the context well.
The La�ukikopama-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel continue by examining
the case of those who are not willing to follow the Buddha’s instructions. While the
Majjhima-nikāya version turns to this theme in a somewhat abrupt manner, the Madhyama-āgama discourse offers a transition to the same topic. According to its account,
the Buddha at first praised Udāyī and then contrasted him with foolish monks who are
unwilling to follow the regulations promulgated by the Buddha. [136]
The absence of such a transition in the Majjhima-nikāya version could be a case of
textual loss, as the passage on those who are not willing to follow the Buddha’s injunctions begins with the phrase “in the same way”. [137] In other discourses, this phrase has the
function of connecting a passage to something said earlier, but in the present case the
same phrase hangs somewhat in the air, as it does not really refer to anything said earlier. Thus, an earlier version of the La�ukikopama-sutta might have had a transition
similar to what is still found in the Madhyama-āgama version, a transition that might
then have been lost at some point during the transmission of the discourse.
In both versions, those who do not follow the Buddha’s injunction assume his instruction to be concerned with a mere trifle. Yet, such a mere trifle can in turn become a
strong form of bondage, which the La�ukikopama-sutta compares to a quail tethered by
a rotting creeper, while the Madhyama-āgama version compares it to a fly caught in a
drop of saliva and unable to extricate itself. [138]
The two versions contrast these disobedient disciples with those who follow the Buddha’s instruction and abandon what he asks them to abandon, comparable to a strong
royal elephant that is able to break even strong thongs. A minor difference between the
two versions is that whereas in the Majjhima-nikāya version those willing to implement the Buddha’s instruction still consider the matter in question to be a mere trifle, [139]
according to the Madhyama-āgama version even such a consideration does not occur
to them. [140]
The La�ukikopama-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel continue with another
simile that illustrates the bondage of someone unwilling to follow the Buddha’s instructions with the example of a poor man in wretched living conditions. Although inspired to go forth on seeing a monk seated in meditation, this poor man is nevertheless

suggested that it would be better for the begging monk to cut up his own belly instead of searching for
alms in this way.

also Dhirasekera 1970.

Buddha and is preceded by a section spoken by Udāyī.

so attached to his meagre belongings that he is unable to abandon them. The two versions illustrate the complementary case of those who obey the Buddha’s instruction by
depicting a rich person who, similarly inspired to go forth on seeing a monk seated in
meditation, indeed abandons all his wealth and goes forth.

MN I 453  The La�ukikopama-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel continue by taking up
four cases for closer examination:

      - one who tolerates thoughts related to belongings or sensuality,

      - one who dispels them,

      - one in whom they arise due to temporary absent-mindedness, but who then
quickly abandons them,

      - one who is liberated. [141]
The two versions agree that the first three are still in bondage, whereas the fourth is
free from bondage.
The Majjhima-nikāya version reports that the Buddha reckoned them in this way because he knew the “diversity of faculties” in each case. [142] According to the Madhyamaāgama discourse, however, the Buddha reckoned the first three types to be still in bondage because any fetter is unwholesome, [143] whereas the fourth type can be reckoned as
free from bondage, since all fetters have been eradicated.
The Madhyama-āgama presentation thereby indicates that the purpose of bringing in
the four types of person is to highlight again the unwholesome nature of any fetter,
whether weak or strong. That is, although there is a difference between the three persons in how they deal with the arising of unwholesomeness in their minds, yet, all three
are still in bondage to the fetters. This indication ties in with the theme of weak and
strong fetters, a theme of central relevance throughout the two versions.

MN I 454  The La�ukikopama-sutta and its parallel continue by contrasting ignoble types of
pleasure with recommendable types of pleasure. The ignoble pleasures that should better be avoided are sensual pleasures, while the type of pleasures that should be developed are the pleasures of jhāna. Both versions take up the mental factor(s) of a particular jhāna that need(s) to be overcome in order to proceed to the next jhāna, until with
the fourth jhāna imperturbability has been reached. [144]

which due to “diversity of faculties”, indriyavemattatā, there will be “diversity of fruits”, phalavemattatā. Their parallel [[SA653]] at T II 183b12, however, speaks in the same context of “perfection of faculties”,, leading to “perfection of fruits”,, which suggests that its original may have
read pāramitā, instead of vemattatā or vaimātratā. The “diversity of faculties”, indriyavemattatā, recurs
again in Pe� 30,24 to distinguish different types of stream-entrant, and in Vism 710,4 to distinguish different types of non-returner.

Highlighting the need to go beyond even the subtlest fetter, the two versions clarify
that each of the four jhānas needs to be abandoned and transcended. This process of
transcendence takes place by attaining the next jhāna in the series, followed by each of
the four immaterial attainments. The La�ukikopama-sutta stands alone in culminating
this description of successive stages of transcendence with the attainment of the cessation of perceptions and feelings. [145]


[[MN67]] Cātumā-sutta

The Cātumā-sutta, the “discourse at Cātumā”, relates how the Buddha took a noisy
group of monks to task. This discourse has a parallel in the Ekottarika-āgama and another parallel in an individual translation. [146] The later part of the Cātumā-sutta, which
examines four types of danger to the monastic life, recurs as a discourse on its own in
the A�guttara-nikāya. [147]
The Cātumā-sutta and its Chinese parallels report that a large group of monks, led by
Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna, had come to visit the Buddha. On arrival, these monks
created a lot of noise. According to the Pāli version, the Buddha asked Ānanda to summon the monks to his presence and, when they had come, told them that they should
leave. [148] The two Chinese discourses report that the Buddha did not even call the
monks to his presence, but simply told Ānanda that these monks should not be allowed
to stay. [149]
The three versions agree that a group of Sakyans and Brahmā intervened on behalf of
the monks. According to the Cātumā-sutta, the Sakyans delivered two similes in order
to reconcile the Buddha with the monks, after which Brahmā Sahampati delivered the
same two similes. [150] These two similes use the image of a seed in need of water and of
a calf longing for its mother to illustrate the need these newly ordained monks had of

being in the presence of the Buddha. The same two similes recur in the Ekottarikaāgama version, with the difference that according to its report the Sakyans came out
only with the simile of the seed in need of water, while the simile of the calf longing
for its mother was spoken only by Brahmā (see table 7.5). [151] Since in the Cātumā-sutta
the Sakyans had already delivered both similes, in this version Brahmā’s intervention
just involves repeating what had already been said.

According to another Pāli discourse, found in the Sa�yutta-nikāya, Brahmā Sahampati had delivered both of these two similes on what appears to be another occasion
when the Buddha had dismissed a group of monks. [152] In this Sa�yutta-nikāya discourse,
the two similes had already occurred to the Buddha on his own while he was reflecting
in solitude, before Brahmā came and spoke them. [153] Hence in this case, similar to the
presentation in the Cātumā-sutta, Brahmā Sahampati’s function is merely to repeat the
two similes. A parallel to this Sa�yutta-nikāya discourse in the Sa�yukta-agama, however, does not record that either the Buddha or Brahmā thought of or spoke any of these
two similes. [154]

MN I 459   The Cātumā-sutta continues by reporting that Mahāmoggallāna informed the company of monks that the Sakyans and Brahmā Sahampati had succeeded in convincing
the Buddha to let the monks come back. [155] The Pāli commentary explains that Mahāmoggallāna had witnessed Brahmā Sahampati’s intervention with his divine eye and


151 [[EA45.2]] at T II 771a8+17. T 137 at T II 860b28 only reports a simile delivered by the Sakyans, which

does not mention Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna. It, moreover, proceeds quite differently after Brahmā’s intervention, giving the impression that [[SN22.80]] and [[MN67]] record different events. Yet another
occasion when the Buddha dismissed noisy monks from his presence is recorded in [[UD3.3]] at [[UD25.11]]
In this case, the dismissal spurred the monks to make an effort and practise seriously in seclusion, with
the result that they all attained the three higher knowledges.
153 Since according to [[SN22.80]] these two similes occurred to the Buddha while being in seclusion, from
the perspective of this discourse he might have been remembering them from the time when he first
came across them in relation to the events depicted in [[MN67]] In this case, the events described in [[MN67]] would precede the episode described in [[SN22.80]] According to an explanation given in Mil 210,7,
however, these two similes were not new to the Buddha even when they were delivered for the first
time, since due to his omniscience he knew them already.

through his telepathic knowledge had come to know that the intervention had been successful. [156] The individual translation similarly indicates that Mahāmoggallāna had become aware of the turn of events through his divine eye. [157] According to the Ekottarika-āgama report, however, the Buddha just looked at Ānanda, who understood what
this meant and straightaway went to inform Sāriputta that the monks were allowed to
return. [158]
The Cātumā-sutta and its Chinese parallels record that once Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna had returned, the Buddha asked them to relate what they had thought when he
dismissed the monks. According to the Majjhima-nikāya and Ekottarika-āgama accounts,
while Sāriputta wanted to follow the Buddha’s example and remain inactive, Mahāmoggallāna had been conscious of the need to look after the other monks. The Cātumāsutta and its Ekottarika-āgama parallel agree that the Buddha censured Sāriputta and
praised Mahāmoggallāna. [159]
The Cātumā-sutta continues with an exposition on four types of danger to be expected for a monk gone forth, an exposition that recurs in similar terms as a discourse
in the A�guttara-nikāya. [160] The Ekottarika-āgama version instead continues by contrasting nine qualities conducive to decline with nine qualities that will lead to growth, [161]
followed by a set of stanzas on the need to overcome birth, old age, and death through
right conduct and diligence.
While the Cātumā-sutta simply concludes with the delight of the listening monks, according to the conclusion of the Ekottarika-āgama discourse, with the delivery of this

158 [[EA45.2]] at T II 771a20. A similar situation is described in [[MN85]] at MN II 92,32, where the Buddha
also just looks at Ānanda and the latter understands and immediately takes action.
159 [[MN67]] at MN I 459,19: “wait, Sāriputta, wait, Sāriputta, you should not let such a state of mind arise
again”, āgamehi tva�, sāriputta, āgamehi tva�, sāriputta, na kho te, sāriputta, puna pi evarūpa� citta� uppādetabban ti (the later part of this sentence is completely absent from the Burmese edition at
B [e] -M II 122,19, which only reads āgamehi tva�, sāriputta, āgamehi tva�, sāriputta, di��hadhammasukhavihāran ti, C [e] -M II 210,10 combines these two versions, reading: āgamehi tva�, sāriputta, āgamehi tva�, sāriputta, di��hadhammasukhavihāran ti, na kho te, sāriputta, puna pi evarūpa� citta�
uppādetabban ti). [[EA45.2]] at T II 771b6: “don’t arouse such thoughts”, . The individual
translation seems to reverse the role of the two monks, since according to T 137 at T II 860c20+28 the
Buddha praised Sāriputta and advised Mahāmoggallāna against the type of thoughts he had been entertaining on this occasion.
160 A minor difference between the two Pāli versions is that when describing a monk who goes out begging, according to [[MN67]] at MN I 461,25 and MN I 462,7 this monk does not guard his body and his
speech, whereas according to [[AN4.122]] at AN II 125,14 and AN II 126,1 he also does not guard his
mind, arakkhitena cittena. Since the problem taken up in both versions is that the monk’s mind was
overwhelmed by sensual desire, the presentation in [[AN4.122]] seems to fit the present context particularly well.
161 [[EA45.2]] at T II 771b19. The nine things leading to growth are frequenting good friends, practising 莫生此念
proper conduct, enjoying seclusion, being free from illness, having few possessions, being without attachment in regard to requisites, being energetic, understanding the meaning of what one hears, and being keen on listening to the Dharma.

discourse over sixty monks became arahants. [162] The individual translation also records
that sixty monks became arahants, adding that numberless monks attained stream-entry
at the conclusion of the discourse as well. The individual translation differs from the
Ekottarika-āgama version in as much as, according to its account, all that was required
for leading the monks to realization was a single stanza spoken by the Buddha. [163]


[[MN68]] Na�akapāna-sutta

The Na�akapāna-sutta, the “discourse at Na�akapāna”, takes up the following three
topics:

      - the importance of delighting in the holy life,

      - the reasons why the Buddha still engages in restraint,

      - the inspiration that arises from hearing about the attainments reached by others.
This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama. [164]

MN I 463  The Na�akapāna-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel begin by relating that the
Buddha inquired whether Anuruddha and other monk disciples, who apparently had recently gone forth, were delighting in the holy life. [165] Both versions clarify that Anuruddha and his companions delighted in the holy life and that they had not gone forth due
to outer constraints, but in order to win liberation from dukkha. [166]


162 [[EA45.2]] at T II 771c15.
163 T 137 at T II 861a2: “use faith to cross the flood, with diligence as boat, the noble truth relieves [one]
from the misery of dukkha, wisdom is the ultimate crossing over”,
This stanza reminds of a stanza found in the Ā�avaka-sutta, [[SN10.12]] at SN I 214,26
(= [[SNP1.10]] at [[SNP184]]), according to which “by faith one crosses the flood, by diligence the sea, through
energy one overcomes dukkha, through wisdom one is purified”, saddhāya tarati ogha�, appamādena
a��ava�, viriyena dukkham acceti, paññāya parisujjhati (SN [2] 246 at SN [2] I 462,11: taratī, B [e] -SN I 217,2:
vīriyena, C [e] -SN I 382,9: dukkha�).
164 The parallel is [[MA77]] at T I 544b-546c and has the title “discourse on three clansmen at Sāketa”,
. While [[MN68]] takes place at Na�akapāna (for a tale related to this location cf. Jā 20 at
Jā I 170-172), [[MA77]] takes place at, which Anesaki 1908: 47, Minh Chau 1964/1991: 340, and
the Madhyama-āgama edition p. 641 note 5 identify with Sāketa. Notably, [[MA9]] at T I 431a5 renders the same Sāketa with the slightly different (Akanuma 1930/1994: 558 lists 以信渡流氾, 無放逸為船, and 聖諦濟
苦患, as alternative renderings of Sāketa). Such variations are not unusual in the case of less known 智慧究竟渡.
proper names, cf. also Meisig 1990: 84.
165 The Pāli editions show some variations in their respective listings of the monks that were present together with Anuruddha during the delivery of this discourse. E [e] -MN I 462,26 lists Anuruddha, Nandiya,
Kimbila, Bhagu, Ku��adhāna, Revata, and Ānanda; B [e] -MN II 125,22 lists Anuruddha, Bhaddiya, Kimila, Bhagu, Ko��añña, Revata, and Ānanda; C [e] -MN II 216,4 lists Anuruddha, Bhaddiya, Kimbila, Bhagu, 娑雞
帝三族姓子經 Ku��adhāna, Revata, and Ānanda; and S [e] -MN II 203,5 lists Anuruddha, Bhaddiya, Kimbila, Bhagu, Ko��añña, Revata, and Ānanda. Vin II 182, 娑雞帝 25 reports that Bhaddiya, Bhagu, Kim(b)ila, and Ānanda went
forth at the same time as Anuruddha, which would fit their inclusion in the present context. According 佛光
to [[MA77]] at T I 544b24, however, Anuruddha was only in the company of Nandiya and Kimbila, 婆雞帝 娑雞帝 the 婆
two 雞帝 monks who in other discourses also stay with him, cf., e.g., [[MN31]] at MN I 205,17, [[MN128]] at MN III
155,14, [[MA72]] at T I 536a19, [[MA185]] at T I 729c4, and [[EA24.8]] at T II 629a15.
166 [[MA77]] at T I 544c11 differs from [[MN68]] at MN I 463,16 in that according to its report the Buddha


Chapter 7 Bhikkhu-vagga                                      -  371


According to the Na�akapāna-sutta, the Buddha explained to Anuruddha and his companions that, after going forth, they should develop non-sensual pleasure (by attaining
jhāna), in order to be no longer overpowered by unwholesome states of mind. The Madhyama-āgama version introduces the same topic as an exposition on the causes for obtaining innumerable wholesome qualities, [167] adding to the Majjhima-nikāya presentation that the experience of non-sensual pleasure will also enable them to patiently bear
hunger and thirst, cold and heat, insect bites, evil words, and bodily pains.
The Na�akapāna-sutta continues by reporting that the Buddha asked Anuruddha and
his companions if they thought that the Buddha practised restraint because he had not
yet eradicated the influxes, which Anuruddha denied. [168] According to the Madhyamaāgama account, the Buddha asked Anuruddha what he thought to be the reason why
the Buddha engaged in restraint, in reply to which Anuruddha asked the Buddha to
elaborate. The Buddha then explained that although he had completely eradicated the
influxes, he nevertheless undertook such practices because of the existence of the body,
of the six sense-spheres, and of the life faculty. [169]
In regard to this difference between the Na�akapāna-sutta and its parallel, the question asked by the Buddha in the Majjhima-nikāya version strikes an unexpected note. It
is not clear why the newly ordained Anuruddha and his companions should be having
any doubt about the Buddha’s awakening. Thus, for the Buddha to ask if they had such
thoughts comes unexpected. In contrast, the Madhyama-āgama version’s presentation
reads more natural, as it simply explains why even those who have reached the goal
still practise restraint, without insinuating that Anuruddha and his companions could
have been in doubt about the Buddha’s successful destruction of the influxes.
Another puzzling aspect of the present passage occurs in regard to the Buddha’s
practice of restraint. The Majjhima-nikāya and Madhyama-āgama versions agree that
he undertook the practice of “removing”. [170] According to the explanation of this practice in the Sabbāsava-sutta and its parallel, “removing” refers to removing arisen
thoughts of sensual desire, ill will, and cruelty. [171] Since being a Buddha implies that


specified that Anuruddha and his companions had gone forth against the wish of their weeping parents.
A similar specification in relation to the Buddha’s going forth occurs in several other discourses, cf.,
e.g., [[MN26]] at MN I 163,29 and its parallel [[MA204]] at T I 776b3, although the Pāli discourses appear
to use this description only in relation to the Buddha, not in relation to other monks.

III 108,27 in relation to the type of inevitable disturbance that will still be present after all mental disturbances have been overcome by destroying the influxes.
170 According to [[MN68]] at MN I 464,14, the Buddha undertook the practices of “using”, pa�isevana, “enduring”, adhivāsana, “avoiding”, parivajjana, and “removing”, vinodana; according to [[MA77]] at T I
545a11 he undertook the practices of “removing”,, “using”,, “enduring”,, “stopping”,, and
“throwing up” or “vomiting”, .
171 [[MN2]] at MN I 11,10 and [[MA10]] at T I 432c13. This explanation recurs in the Sa�gītiparyāya’s commentary on the corresponding passage in the 得無量善法 Sa�gīti-sūtra, T 1536 at T XXVI 394c28.

one has overcome all unwholesome states of mind, the Buddha should not experience
such thoughts in the first place, so that a need to remove them should not arise at all.
Thus, when considered from the perspective of the Sabbāsava-sutta, for the fully
awakened Buddha to be engaging in “removing” fails to make sense, as he should not
have any thought that need to be removed. Perhaps at an early stage during their transmission, both versions were influenced by occurrences of listings found elsewhere in
the discourses that cover the same set of four, whereby a reference to “removing” became part of the present passage as well, even though this does not fit the context. [172]
The Madhyama-āgama version continues by explaining that the Buddha’s reason for
living in seclusion was not to attain what he had not attained. Rather, he lived in seclusion because it was a pleasant abiding for himself and out of concern for others. The
Na�akapāna-sutta does not broach the topic of the Buddha’s delight in solitude and retreat, although the same reasoning for the Buddha’s secluded life style recurs in other
Pāli discourses in a similar formulation. [173]
When compared to these Pāli passages, the Madhyama-āgama discourse can be seen
to offer an additional explanation on the second of the two reasons for the Buddha’s
secluded life style, his concern for others. According to the Madhyama-āgama account,
the Buddha’s undertook a secluded life style in order to set an example for others to
emulate. [174]
The two versions explain that the Buddha did not declare the type of rebirth of a deceased disciple out of any mean motivation, but rather to inspire other disciples. [175] The
Na�akapāna-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel describe in similar terms how a
monk will be inspired when he hears that another monk, who has passed away, had attained any of the four levels of awakening.
Both versions apply the same treatment to the case of a nun who hears about the attainments of another nun, and to the cases of male or female lay disciples who hear about

172 The set of four practices found in [[MN68]] and [[MA77]] recurs in [[DN33]] at DN III 224,20 and at DN III
270,2 (= [[DN34]] at DN III 291,5), cf. also the reconstructed Sanskrit counterpart in Stache-Rosen 1968:
102, other occurrences are [[AN9.2]] at AN IV 354,6 and [[AN10.20]] at AN V 30,27.
173 [[MN4]] at MN I 23,32 and [[AN2.3]] at AN I 60,30.
174 [[MA77]] at T I 545b9: “out of compassion for later generations, so that later generations may follow [the
example] of the Tathāgata and [similarly] stay in secluded places”,
.
175 Mabbett 2001: 127-128 comments that in the present instance the Buddha seems to be “on the defensive; after declaring the rebirth states of deceased disciples, he had to explain that this was done not for
the sake of his reputation ... no doubt criticism of such practices had been received”. A minor but noteworthy difference in this passage is that [[MN68]] at MN I 465,8 depicts the inspiration that a son of a
good family, kulaputta, will obtain on hearing such reports, whereas its parallel [[MA77]] at T I 545b23
describes the same for sons and daughters of good families, . This appears to be a recurring difference between the two collections, as [[MA27]] at T I 458a28 uses the same expression in
regard to the practice of the four brahmavihāras, where its parallel [[MN97]] at MN II 195,3 instead
speaks of “a monk”, and [[MA180]] at T I 722a22 speaks of sons and daughters of good families in the 為慈愍後生人故, 或有後生人效如
context of giving a gift, while its parallel [[MN142]] at MN III 255, 來住無事處 29 does not specify the nature of the
person who gives a gift; cf. also Skilling 2000a: 66-67.

other male or female lay disciples that have attained any of the three lower stages of
awakening. [176]


[[MN69]] Gulissāni-sutta

The Gulissāni-sutta, the “discourse to Gulissāni”, records an instruction by Sāriputta
on proper behaviour for a forest monk who visits a monastic community. This discourse
has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama. [177]
The Gulissāni-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel relate that the forest dweller
Gulissāni, a monk of lax behaviour, had come to visit the monastic community. [178] The


176 [[MN68]] at MN I 467,7+32 and [[MA77]] at T I 546b6 and T I 546c2 agree on mentioning only the three
lower levels of awakening in relation to male and female lay followers. This presentation does not imply, as assumed by Hwang 2006: 34, that “the state of non-return is the maximum achievement for lay
people, and only monks or nuns can achieve sainthood”; cf. also, e.g., Dutt 1957: 145 and Lamotte 1952:
388 or id. 1959: 42. As Bodhi in Ñā�amoli 1995/2005: 1273 note 691 explains, “though early Buddhism
recognises the possibility of lay persons attaining arahantship, in all such cases attested to in the Nikāyas, they do so either when on the verge of death or just before requesting admission into the Sangha”. A case in point would be Yasa, who according to Vin I 17,3 became an arahant while still a layman, and thereon requested ordination. The same is also reported in several biographies of the Buddha,
T 189 at T III 645b11, T 190 at T III 818c15, and T 191 at T III 955a16, in the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya, T
1421 at T XXII 105b28, and in the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, T 1450 at T XXIV 129b8, whereas according to the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, T 1428 at T XXII 789c6, he went forth after having attained
stream-entry, and as a monk then became an arahant, T 1428 at T XXII 790a1. That is, although a layman or a laywoman can attain full awakening, once that has happened they will no longer live a household life but will go forth, since to live the life of a monk or a nun is a natural expression of their attainment. The assumption by Bluck 2002: 10, Harvey 1990: 218, Samuels 1999: 238, Schumann 1982/1999:
217, and Somaratne 2009: 153 that [[AN6.119-120]] at AN III 450-451 proves the existence of lay arahants
does not seem to be correct, as these discourses only indicate that several householders had reached
some level of awakening, not necessarily the highest, in fact [[AN6.44]] at AN III 348,3+5 reports that the
two householders Purā�a and Isidatta mentioned in the listing in [[AN6.120]] at AN III 451,13 passed
away as once-returners. Anāthapi��ika is also mentioned in [[AN6.120]] at AN III 451,8, yet he could not
have been an arahant, since his rebirth in a heavenly realm is reported in [[MN143]] at MN III 262,1, [[SA593]] at T II 158b25, SĀ [2] 187 at T II 441c12, and [[EA51.8]] at T II 820a16; cf. also below p. 824.
177 The parallel is [[MA26]] at T I 454c-456a. [[MA26]] agrees with [[MN69]] on taking the name of the monk in
relation to whom the discourse was spoken as its title,, and on locating the discourse in the
Squirrels’ Feeding Ground by Rājagaha. The Pāli editions show some variations in regard to the name
of this monk. While E [e] -MN I 469,3 and C [e] -MN II 228,3 introduce him as Gulissāni, B [e] -MN II 133,5
gives his name as Goliyāni, and S [e] -MN II 214,3 as Golissāni. Minh Chau 1964/1991: 173-175 offers a
comparison of the aspects of conduct listed in [[MN69]] and in [[MA26]] cf. also Watanabe 1983/1996: 25.
De Jong 1988: 12 notes that the present discourse is referred to in the Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, T 1435 at T
XXIII 301a27, as which he reconstructs as Goni�ādasūtra. A presentation that in some
respects has affinities with sections of the Gulissāni-sutta, although being much shorter and without a
comparable narrative framework (the discourse is in fact spoken by the Buddha), can be found in [[EA20.8]] at T II 600b18. For a discourse quotation in Abhidh-k-� cf. below note 184.
178 The Madhyama-āgama edition p. 189 note 1 draws attention to the circumstance that [[MA26]] uses 瞿尼師經
throughout the expression “no thing”,, to render “forest dweller”, araññaka or ara�yaka, yet the

Madhyama-āgama version notes that Gulissāni was arrogant and restless, with a mind
like a monkey. [179]
Sāriputta was seated with a group of monks and, on seeing from afar that Gulissāni
was approaching them, he took up the opportunity to address the monks on how a visiting forest dweller should behave in order to avoid censure.
The theme of the proper conduct to be adopted by a visiting monk is presented in the
two versions with several differences (see table 7.6). The Gulissāni-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel agree, however, on the following requirements that a visiting monk
should fulfil:

 - be respectful,

 - behave appropriately in regard to seats, [180]

 - not enter the village too early or return too late,

 - not be arrogant or agitated, [181]

 - not engage in loose talk, [182]

 - keep the senses restrained,

 - know moderation with food,

 - be energetic,

 - be mindful,

 - apply himself to the higher doctrine and discipline, [183]


preceding discourse [[MA25]] at T I 454a19 employs to render “forest dweller”. This could be the
only occurrence of in the Madhyama-āgama, whereas recurs frequently in Madhyamaāgama discourses to refer to a forest dwelling (occurrences in the whole collection are too numerous to
be listed, a few examples are [[MA18]] at T I 442a1, [[MA19]] at T I 444b27, [[MA33]] at T I 473c24, [[MA63]]
at T I 500a14). occurs, however, in several Ekottarika-āgama discourses, a collection translated
by Zhú Fóniàn ( ), cf. [[EA12.5]] at T II 569c14, [[EA12.6]] at T II 570a25, [[EA13.1]] at T II 571b2, [[EA25.6]] at T II 633b16, [[EA37.3]] at T II 711a8, [[EA38.6]] at T II 721a1, [[EA39.10]] at T II 734a9, and [[EA49.2]]
at T II 795a26. The different ways of rendering the “forest dweller”, araññaka or ara�yaka, found in
the Madhyama-āgama collection, are noteworthy in so far as they might support the suggestion by Lü
1963: 242 that the extant translation may have incorporated terms from the earlier translation of the
Madhyama-āgama by Zhú Fóniàn ( ), in addition to the translation vocabulary employed by 阿練若
Gautama Sa�ghadeva (cf. also below p. 617 note 158 and p. 785 note 143). Alternatively, the present 阿練若 無事
could just be an instance of a general pattern, in fact in the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya different renderings
of ara�ya are also used side by side, cf. Heirman 2003: 10-11.
179 [[MA26]] at T I 454c 阿練若 28.
180 [[MN69]] at MN I 469, 竺佛念 18 indicates that an aspect of proper behaviour in regard to seats is to not “keep
off” young monks from their seats, nave ca bhikkhū na āsanena pa�ibāhissāmī ti. [[MA26]] at T I 455c8
instead speaks of not “scolding” them,, which could be due to mistaking pa�ibāhati or pratibādhate,
“to keep off”, for pa�ibhāsati or pratibhā�ate, “to retaliate”.
181 [[MN69]] at MN I 470,9: anuddhatena bhavitabba� acapalena, [[MA26]] at T I 455a11 recommends to “not

A difference can be found between the Pāli editions in regard to the need to observe
proper behaviour in regard to seats. The Burmese edition presents the need to know proper behaviour as a quality of its own, separate from the need to know proper behaviour
in regard to seats, [186] a way of reckoning that appears to also be reflected in the commentary. [187] In the other Pāli editions, however, both occur together as a single quality.


184 A discourse quotation with the description of the peaceful liberations, found in [[MN69]] at MN I 472,14,
can be found in Abhidh-k 2:15 and 8:3 in Pradhan 1967: 48,8 and 435,8 (not necessarily stemming specifically from the present discourse); cf. also T 1558 at T XXIX 17a1 and T 1559 at T XXIX 176a28, as
well as Abhidh-k-� at D (4094) mngon pa, ju 57a3 or Q (5595) tu 62b3.
185 [[MN69]] at MN I 472,25 refers to “applying oneself to superhuman states”, uttarimanussadhamme yogo
kara�īyo, an expression that would also cover deeper levels of concentration; on the term cf. also
Anālayo 2008n. [[MA26]] at T I 456a3 speaks instead of being able to discuss “the higher knowledge of
the destruction of the influxes”, .
186 Be-MN II 133,23 stipulates ābhisamācārikopi dhammo jānitabbo as its third quality, while Ee-MN I
469,22, C [e] -MN II 228,16, and S [e] -MN II 215,3 only use this expression as part of the criticism voiced by
other monks in relation to improper behaviour in regard to seats, thereby not presenting it as a separate
quality. Due to this difference, the Burmese edition counts eighteen qualities, while the other Pāli editions list only seventeen. The listing in [[MA26]] comprises thirteen qualities.
187 Ps III 184,6, after explaining “being skilled with seats”, turns to examine “proper behaviour”. This way
of proceeding suggests that the commentary considered proper behaviour as a quality on its own, similar to the reading now found in the Burmese edition, which reckons “proper behaviour” as a separate
quality.
漏盡智通


376   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


The Madhyama-āgama version also does not present knowledge of proper behaviour
as a quality separate from knowledge of proper behaviour in regard to seats. [188]

MN I 470   An aspect of conduct mentioned in the Gulissāni-sutta that is not found in its Madhyama-āgama parallel it to avoid visiting families before and after the meal. [189] That a
monk should not visit families before or after the meal might at first sight appear redundant, as both versions already mentioned the need to avoid entering the village too
early or return from it too late, which seems to be of similar meaning. A closer examination of the Vinaya accounts of these two stipulations, however, shows that they differ
sufficiently to merit separate mention. [190]

MN I 471   Another difference is that the Gulissāni-sutta takes up the need for a visiting monk to
be concentrated and wise, while the same two qualities are not mentioned in its parallel
in the Madhyama-āgama. [191] Their absence from the Madhyama-āgama version does
not appear to imply a major difference in perspective, as this version agrees with the
Gulissāni-sutta on mentioning the need to apply oneself to the higher doctrine and
discipline, to the immaterial attainments, [192] and to the attainment of realization. From

189 [[MN69]] at MN I 469,34: na purebhatta� pacchābhatta� kulesu cāritta� āpajjitabba�.
190 According to Vin IV 164,13 (pācittiya rule 85), the problem caused by entering a village at the wrong
time was that some unruly monks had gone to the village and participated in all kinds of worldly talk
with the villagers, which let to people criticising them for behaving just like householders. Conversely,
the regulation on visiting families had a different background, as according to Vin IV 98,3 (pācittiya
rule 46) the problem in this case was that a particular monk had spent much time visiting families before the meal. As the host was expecting his arrival, other monks were kept waiting until time had
passed and it was too late for them to have their fill. Rebuked by the Buddha, this monk had then taken
to visiting families after the meal. As a result, food sent for him and other monks to the monastery
could not be used, since he came back too late to be able to accept the food before noon and thereby
also deprived the other monks of their share. A perusal of the same two regulations in other Vinayas
supports the impression that the issue of entering a village at the wrong time and the issue of visiting
families before or after the meal constitute two different aspects of a monk’s improper behaviour. Regulations corresponding to the Theravāda pācittiya rules 46 and 85 are pātayantika rules 42 and 83 in the
Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, T 1428 at T XXII 665c1 and T XXII 692c26, rules 80 and 81 in the Kāśyapīya
Vinaya, T 1460 at T XXIV 663b27, rules 80 and 81 in the Mahāsā�ghika Vinaya, T 1425 at T XXII
389a7 and T XXII 389c21, rules 82 and 83 in the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya, T 1421 at T XXII 69c14 and T
XXII 70a18, rules 80 and 81 in the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, T 1442 at T XXIII 864c14 and T XXIII
866b7, and rules 80 and 81 in the Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, T 1435 at T XXIII 123b12 and T XXIII 124b5.
Although the stories leading to these regulations differ, these Vinayas agree on presenting these issues
as two different matters.
191 [[MA26]] at T I 455b21 at this point only enjoins that such a monk “should train in right mindfulness and
clear comprehension”, . [[MN69]] at MN I 471,22+28+34 lists three separate qualities:
“established mindfulness should be developed”, upa��hitasatinā bhavitabba� (B [e] -MN II 136,10: upa��hitassatinā), “[the quality of] being concentrated should be developed”, samāhitena bhavitabba�, and
“[the quality of] being wise should be developed”, paññāvatā bhavitabba�.
192 A quotation that appears to stem from a version of the present passage on the need for a forest monk to
be able to discourse on the topic of the immaterial attainments can be found in the Yogācārabhūmi, cf.
Delhey 2009a: 148,6 and T 1579 at T XXX 331a13.

this perspective, although the listings in the two versions differ in formulation, the need
for concentration and wisdom is taken into account in both versions.
The Gulissāni-sutta and its parallel agree that Mahāmoggallāna intervened at this
point and asked Sāriputta if such type of conduct should be expected only of a forest
dweller. In reply, Sāriputta clarified that the same certainly applies also to a towndwelling monk. [193]


[[MN70]] Kī�āgiri-sutta

The Kī�āgiri-sutta, the “discourse at Kī�āgiri”, starts by reporting how the Buddha
admonished a group of monks who were unwilling to follow his injunction not to eat at
night, followed by providing a description of types of disciple at different levels of realization. This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama. [194]
The Kī�āgiri-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel begin with the Buddha instructing his monks about the proper time to take food. [195] The two versions describe in similar terms that the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka, on being told about this regulation
by other monks, refused to follow it. When the Buddha was informed about this refusal,
he called Assaji and Punabbasuka to his presence.
In the Majjhima-nikāya version, the Buddha asked Assaji and Punabbasuka whether
in the course of his teachings he had ever made the proposal that experiencing any type
of feelings will (automatically) cause unwholesome states to diminish and wholesome
states to increase. [196] Assaji and Punabbasuka had to admit that the Buddha had never
made such a proposition.
According to the Madhyama-āgama discourse, the Buddha had rather asked them
whether they thought his teaching to imply that with pleasant feelings unwholesomeness increases and with painful feeling wholesomeness increases. [197] Assaji and Punabbasuka agreed to this proposal, a misunderstanding for which the Buddha rebuked them. [198]

193 [[MA26]] at T I 456a17 concludes with a stanza that sums up the qualities to be expected of a visiting
monk. Before coming to this stanza, [[MA26]] reports that Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna rejoiced in each
others’ words and departed, so that the stanza seems to be an uddāna by the reciters of the discourse.
194 The parallel is [[MA195]] at T I 749c-752c, which is entitled after the leader of the group of unruly
monks, being the “discourse to Assaji”, (adopting the and variant reading instead of ). [[MA195]] agrees with [[MN70]] on locating the discourse in the Kāsi country. For a discourse
quotation in Abhidh-k-� cf. below note 202.
195 According to [[MN70]] at MN I 473,11, the instruction was to abstain from food at night, aññatr’ eva rattibhojanā bhuñjatha. In [[MA195]] at T I 749c4 the instruction reads, literally to take “day one
meal”, which at first sight would seem to refer to taking only a single meal per day. Yet, [[MA194]] at T I
746b27 refers to taking only a single meal as “one seat meal”,, corresponding to ekāsanabhojana in its parallel [[MN65]] at MN I 437,21. This suggests that in [[MA195]] would intend “[during the]
day only”, in which case the injunction would be similar to its counterpart [[MN70]]

After rebuking Assaji and Punabbasuka, the Buddha put the same question to the other
monks, who gave the proper reply by stating that this was not the way the Buddha had
taught them.
According to both versions, the proper way of presenting the Buddha’s teaching is to
state that with some pleasant feelings unwholesomeness increases, while with others it
decreases, just as with some unpleasant feelings unwholesomeness increases while
with others it decreases. The Majjhima-nikāya presentation expounds neutral feelings
in the same manner, a treatment not found in its Madhyama-āgama counterpart. [199]
The Kī�āgiri-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel make it clear that the Buddha’s
instructions to give up feelings related to what is unwholesome are based on his own
understanding and experience.
The Madhyama-āgama version at this point also distinguishes pleasant and painful
feelings into bodily and mental types, explaining that the Buddha did not recommend
bodily or mental feelings of pleasure or pain as something only to be developed or else
only to be relinquished, since his injunctions were based on the wholesome or unwholesome repercussions of any type of feeling. [200]

MN I 477  The Kī�āgiri-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel continue by indicating that the
Buddha did not expect all monks to work with diligence. By way of elaboration of this
statement, both versions take up seven types of noble disciple, which they present with
some minor but noteworthy differences. [201]

199 [[MN70]] at MN I 475,23. The absence of neutral feelings in [[MA195]] is unexpected, since usually discourses in the Pāli Nikāyas and in the Chinese Āgamas include all three types of feeling in similar contexts. It would therefore be more in line with other discourses if the present exposition were to cover
also the problem of how some types of neutral feeling may lead to unwholesome results, while other
types of neutral feeling will have wholesome repercussions, as is the case in [[MN70]]
200 [[MA195]] at T I 751a17.
201 While [[MN70]] and [[MA195]] agree on the sequence of presenting these seven noble disciples, a variation
in the sequence of listing these seven noble disciples can be found in the Visuddhimagga. Vism 659,19
begins its exposition with the faith-follower (saddhānusārī), followed by the one liberated-by-faith
(saddhāvimutta), the body-witness (kāyasakkhī), and the one liberated-both-ways (ubhatobhāgavimutta), after which it lists the Dharma-follower (dhammānusārī), the one attained-to-view (di��hippatta),
and the one liberated-by-wisdom (paññāvimutta). The rationale for this presentation appears to be that
the Visuddhimagga attempts to associate the seven noble disciples with how they developed insight.
According to the Visuddhimagga’s presentation, the faith-follower and the one liberated-by-faith should
be associated with contemplation of impermanence; the body-witness and the one liberated-both-ways
should be associated with contemplation of unsatisfactoriness (as this bears a close relationship to the
development of concentration); and the Dharma-follower, the one attained-to-view, and the one liberated-by-wisdom should be associated with contemplation of not-self. This way of presentation could be
based on Pa�is II 49,28, which associates contemplation of impermanence with the faculty of faith, contemplation of unsatisfactoriness with the faculty of concentration, and contemplation of not-self with
the faculty of wisdom. Based on this association, Pa�is II 52,1 then relates contemplation of impermanence to one who is liberated-by-faith, contemplation of unsatisfactoriness to the body-witness, and
contemplation of not-self to one who has attained-to-view. Pa�is II 52,18 continues, however, to put this
into perspective by indicating that contemplation of unsatisfactoriness and of not-self may also lead to
being liberated-by-faith, etc. In fact, in the Pāli discourses contemplation of impermanence, for exam

Chapter 7 Bhikkhu-vagga                                      -  379


According to the Majjhima-nikāya version, the distinguishing mark between the two
types of arahant in this listing, both of which no longer need to work with diligence, is
that the one who is “liberated-both-ways” (ubhatobhāgavimutta) has personal experience of the immaterial liberations, [202] while the one who is “liberated-by-wisdom” (paññāvimutta) has no such personal experience of the immaterial liberations. [203] The Madhyama-āgama version differs in as much as, instead of personal experience of the imma

ple, does not seem to have any particular relationship to the faculty of faith. The Pāli discourses rather
associate contemplation of impermanence with wisdom, speaking of the “wisdom directed to arising
and passing away”, udayatthagāminī paññā, as the type of wisdom par excellence, whether as a faculty,
indriya, or as a power, bala, cf. [[SN48.9]] at SN V 197,18 and [[AN10.2]] at AN III 2,24. Hence, from the
perspective of the Pāli discourses, it seems that the degree to which faith, concentration, or wisdom are
developed by different noble disciples may not bear as direct a relation to the three characteristics as
the presentation in the Visuddhimagga suggests. On the listing of seven types of noble disciple in [[MN70]] cf. also Gombrich 1996: 99-103.
202 A discourse quotation with the description of the peaceful liberations, found in [[MN70]] at MN I 477,26,
can be found in Abhidh-k 2:15 and 8:3 in Pradhan 1967: 48,8 and 435,8 (not necessarily stemming specifically from the present discourse); cf. also T 1558 at T XXIX 17a1 and T 1559 at T XXIX 176a28, as
well as Abhidh-k-� at D (4094) mngon pa, ju 57a3 or Q (5595) tu 62b3.
203 [[MN70]] at MN I 477,26: “he lives having directly experienced the peaceful immaterial liberations that
are beyond form”, ye te santā vimokhā atikkamma rūpe aruppā te kāyena phassitvā viharati (B [e] -MN II
143,2, C [e] -MN II 242,26, and S [e] -MN II 229,5: vimokkhā, B [e] and S [e] also read phusitvā, instead of phassitvā). The expression kāyena phusitvā, literally “having touched with the body”, is an idiomatic expression for personal experience (cf. PED 479 s.v. phusati [1], which clarifies that the usage of this verb is
not confined to physical touch, cf. also Findly 2002: 258). A broader meaning for the term kāya is also
evident, for example, in the term sakkāya, which stands for the whole of one’s “personality”, not only
for its physical aspects, cf. also PED: 207 s.v. kāya. In the present instance, kāyena does not refer to
experiencing an immaterial attainment “through the physical body” and thus has implications quite different from the same expression kāyena phusitvā, when this occurs in relation to the physical experience of touch, pho��habba, e.g., in [[MN27]] at MN I 180,33. The same holds also for the expression kāyena c’ eva paramasacca� sacchikaroti found later in [[MN70]] at MN I 480,9, where again, pace de Silva
1987b: 30, the reference is not to realizing the ultimate truth “with the physical body”, but rather “with
one’s whole being”, i.e., “directly”. Ps III 191,12 glosses kāyena with nāmakāyena, literally the “namebody”, an expression that stands for the mind (cf. also its use in [[DN15]] at DN II 62,15+23+26, where it
indeed stands for the whole of the mind, except consciousness). Katz 1982/1989: 80 aptly translates
kāyena phusitvā in a similar context as “having come into intimate contact with”, Radich 2007: 263
explains that this expression conveys the sense “to know directly and certainly from personal experience”; cf. also Harvey 2009a: 180 note 10. A convenient way of rendering kāyena into German, suggested to me by one of my students, would be “leibhaftig”, which, while preserving the term “body”
(Leib), at the same time clearly conveys the sense of a direct experience. Schmithausen 1981: 214 note
50 and 249 ad. note 50 points out that the corresponding expression in Jain works refers to rules of
conduct for householders and to monastic vows, occurrences where a literal translation as “touching
with the body” would also not be appropriate. According to Lüders 1954: 162, the expression dhamma� kāyena passati in [[DHP|DHP259]] is probably a textual error for the same idiomatic expression kāyena
phusati, a suggestion confirmed by the reading ka’ena pha�a’i in the parallel Gāndhārī Dharmapada
stanza 114 in Brough 1962/2001: 135 (cf. also ibid. pp. 211-212), and the reading kāyena vai sp�śet in
the corresponding Udāna-(varga) stanza 4:21 in Bernhard 1965: 133, so that this stanza would also be
referring to a “direct experience” of the Dharma.


380   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


terial liberations, it takes personal experience of the eight liberations to be marking the
difference between these two types of arahant. [204]
A discourse in the Sa�yukta-āgama, which enumerates and defines the same seven
noble disciples, also speaks of personal experience of the eight liberations when defining the arahant who is “liberated-both-ways”. [205] The same presentation recurs in an
examination of these seven noble disciples in the Puggalapaññatti, which similarly
brings in the eight liberations when describing the arahant who is liberated-both-ways. [206]
That to merit being called “liberated-both-ways” requires personal experience of the
eight liberations is also indicated in the Mahānidāna-sutta and its Chinese parallels,
which define this particular type of arahant in terms of his or her ability to enter these
eight liberations at will. [207]
Thus a definition of an arahant liberated-both-ways by way of his or her personal experience of the immaterial liberations seems to be a mode of presentation specific to
the Kī�āgiri-sutta.
According to the Sa�gīti-sutta and its Chinese parallel, the eight liberations cover
among others the four immaterial attainments. [208] Hence the passages listed so far can
be seen to agree that an arahant who does not have personal experience of the four immaterial attainments cannot be considered “liberated-both-ways”, but would ‘only’ be
an arahant reckoned to be “liberated-by-wisdom”. [209]
Other Pāli discourses exhibit some variations on this point. A discourse in the A�guttara-nikāya speaks of an arahant who is “liberated-both-ways” even when only the first
jhāna has been reached, while another discourse in the same collection describes different types of arahant who are “liberated-by-wisdom”, some apparently able to enter
the immaterial attainments. [210] These two discourses follow each other and define these


204 [[MA195]] at T I 751b15 defines the type of arahant who is liberated-both-ways as “having put into operation personal experience [literally: ‘bodily contact’] of the eight liberations”,, whereas the type of arahant who is liberated-by-wisdom lacks this quality. The same definition can also be
found in the Śrāvakabhūmi, Shukla 1973: 183,7 or ŚSG 2007: 20,9 and T 1579 at T XXX 425b15.

208 [[DN33]] at DN III 262,3 and [[DA9]] at T I 52b14.
209 A subtle difference, however, would be that, with the definition that involves the immaterial attainments, a paññāvimutta would only be bereft of stages of concentration meditation based on the fourth
jhāna. The limit set by the definition that involves the eight deliverances is lower, as the first three out
of the set of eight vimokkhas involve forms of meditation that are related to lower 八解脫身觸成就 jhānas; cf. also Bodhi 2007: 69-70.

their respective treatments as being “in a figurative sense” pariyāyena, they culminate in defining the
ubhatobhāgavimutta and the paññāvimutta as each having reached the attainment of cessation, which
they declare to be the way to define them “not in a figurative sense”, nippariyāyena. Based on this
presentation, one would have to conclude that the terms ubhatobhāgavimutta and paññavimutta simply


Chapter 7 Bhikkhu-vagga                                      -  381


two types of arahant in the same way. As this presentation is self-contradictory and at
variance with the other Pāli and Chinese discourses examined so far, it seems probable
that a textual error has occurred during the process of their transmission. [211]
The Kī�āgiri-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel declare that the two types of
arahant, the one who is “liberated-both-ways” and the one who is “liberated-by-wisdom”, have completed their task. In regard to the other five types of noble disciple,
who are not yet arahants, they recommend diligence, since by frequenting spiritual
friends and developing the faculties these noble disciples can reach full awakening.
In regard to the “body-witness” (kāyasakkhī), the Kī�āgiri-sutta again speaks of personal experience of the immaterial attainments, whereas its Madhyama-āgama parallel
instead mentions the eight liberations. [212] The two versions agree that a body-witness
has not yet destroyed all influxes. The Kī�āgiri-sutta indicates that this noble disciple
has nevertheless destroyed some influxes.
Some Pāli editions of the Kī�āgiri-sutta apply this specification to each of the remaining types of noble disciple. [213] From the perspective of the three influxes listed regularly in other discourses this presentation is puzzling, since the lowest two of the
remaining five types of noble disciple, the Dharma-follower (dhammānusārī) and the
faith-follower (saddhānusārī), have not yet become stream-enterers. As the influx of
sensuality is only eradicated with non-return, and the influxes of existence and ignorance are overcome only with full awakening, it would not be possible to attribute the

refer to the same, a conclusion that would conflict with the distinction drawn between these two noble
disciples in other discourses.
211 This becomes even more evident when one considers [[AN9.43]] the discourse that precedes these two
discourses in the A�guttara-nikāya. [[AN9.43]] at AN IV 451,27 adopts a similar pattern for the body-witness, suggesting that a body-witness could also have only the experience of the first jhāna, pa�hama�
jhāna� upasampajja viharati ... ettāvatā ... kāyasakkhī vutto bhagavatā pariyāyena (C [e] -AN V 536,15
and S [e] -AN IV 473,1: kāyasakkhi). Since other discourses, such as [[MN70]] and its parallel [[MA195]] agree
on attributing the same high degree of concentrative proficiency to an arahant who is “liberated-bothways” and to the “body-witness”, the presentation found in [[AN9.43]] [[AN9.44]] and [[AN9.45]] is most
naturally explained as the result of an error in textual transmission, causing the same treatment to be
applied to three different types of noble disciple: the arahant liberated-both-ways, the arahant liberatedby-wisdom, and the body-witness. What makes this case remarkable is that the presentation in [[AN9.44]]
and [[AN9.45]] if taken at its face value, would imply a substantial doctrinal difference in the way these
two types of arahant are defined. Yet, this ‘doctrinal difference’ is found between discourses belonging
to the same Theravāda tradition and thus cannot easily be attributed to sectarian disagreements between
different early Buddhist schools. In this way, the present instance could serve as a reminder that, even
though the affiliation of a particular text with one or the other of the early Buddhist schools inevitably
has left its traces on the textual transmission, the possibility that differences may just be errors that occurred during transmission should not be lost sight of.

eradication of any of the three influxes to these two noble disciples. The Madhyamaāgama parallel to the Kī�āgiri-sutta, another discourse in the Sa�yukta-āgama, and the
Puggalapaññatti in fact agree in not mentioning influxes at all when describing these
two noble disciples. [214]
Even to attribute the eradication of some influxes to the three disciples in higher
training – the body-witness, the one attained-to-view, and the one liberated-by-faith –
presents to some extent a difficulty, since this would restrict these disciples to the level
of non-return. A discourse in the A�guttara-nikāya, however, indicates that each of
these three noble disciples can have levels of realization that fall short of non-return. [215]
Yet, a stream-enterer or a once-returner – who at the same time could be a body-witness, or one attained-to-view, or one liberated-by-faith – would not have eradicated any
of the three influxes.
An attempt to solve this problem could be made by bringing in the influx of views,
since this influx will be eradicated already with stream-entry. [216] Although the expression used in regard to the body-witness, etc., is formulated in the plural – speaking of
“influxes” being destroyed – this could then be taken to cover either the influx of view
destroyed with stream-entry, or else the influx of view together with the influx of sensuality that has been eradicated by those noble disciples who have progressed up to
non-return. A problem with this solution is that the influx of views appears to be a relatively late addition to the usual set of three influxes, making it less probable that the
presentation in the Kī�āgiri-sutta took this influx into account. [217]

215 [[AN5.26]] at AN I 120,6.
216 According to [[SN41.3]] at SN IV 287,13 and its parallel [[SA570]] at T II 151a21, personality view, sakkāyadi��hi/, underlies all type of views, and such personality view is one of the three fetters overcome with stream-entry, cf., e.g., [[SN12.1]] at [[SNP231]]
217 In the four Nikāyas, the di��hāsava appears to occur only in the PTS edition of [[DN16]] (cf. DN II 81,11,
DN II 84,6, DN II 91,12, DN II 94,18, DN II 98,15, DN II 123,19, and DN II 126,12, cf. also Rahula
1971: 78 note 2), being absent from other discourses and also from the Burmese, Ceylonese, and Siamese editions of [[DN16]] In the four main Āgamas, references to the influx of views or to four influxes
appear to be found mainly in Ekottarika-āgama discourses, cf. [[EA13.7]] at T II 575b29, [[EA16.1]] at T II
578b27, [[EA30.3]] at T II 663c28, [[EA31.6]] at T II 670a13, [[EA31.9]] at T II 672b19, and [[EA40.6]] at T II
741b11, with one instance found in the Sa�yukta-āgama, [[SA490]] at T II 127a4, where the Pāli parallel
[[SN38.8]] at SN IV 256,3 speaks only of three influxes (another occurrence of, found in [[SA1172]] at
T II 313c 身見 20, appears to be a rendering of ogha, cf. the parallel [[SN35.197]] at SN IV 175,12). The influx
of views can also be found in the account of the Buddha’s awakening in the Lalitavistara in Lefmann
1902: 348,22 or in Vaidya 1958b: 252,26, where it comes as the last of the four influxes (in [[DN16]] the
influx of views takes third position). The Daśabhūmika-sūtra in Rahder 1926: 18,5, Vaidya 1967: 11,25,
or Kondō 1983: 23,14, however, still reflects the earlier stage by having only three influxes (noted by
Dayal 1932/1970: 120). Regarding the fourfold reckoning, Buddharakkhita 1978/2004: 102 reasons
that this merely makes explicit what was already implicit in the threefold reckoning, as “the canker of
wrong views ... has been already included in the second [canker] of the Sutta classifications. The canker
for the continuation of becoming can arise only when there is an ideological base which confirms becoming, and even extols it”. A considerable number of di��his referred to in the discourses appear to be 見流
indeed related to forms of becoming. Yet, other instances of views seem to be related to some form of


Chapter 7 Bhikkhu-vagga                                      -  383


Perhaps, then, the present passage in the Kī�āgiri-sutta should be seen as an instance
of a more unspecified usage of the term “influx”, a usage that does not intend either the
three or the four influxes, but which stands in a more general sense for the “flowing in”
of defilements. [218]
The Kī�āgiri-sutta explains that someone “attained-to-view” (di��hippatta) has examined with wisdom the Tathāgata’s teachings, while someone “liberated-by-faith” (saddhāvimutta) has firm faith in the Tathāgata. These two noble disciples share in common the destruction of some influxes by seeing with wisdom. [219] The Madhyama-āgama version adds that both have firm faith in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sa�gha. [220] Although the Majjhima-nikāya version does not explicitly make this point, the
same should implicitly be understood, since both are at the very least stream-enterers,
who by dint of their attainment would be endowed with such firm faith.


hedonism (such as the position taken in [[MN45]] at MN I 305,20 and its parallel [[MA174]] at T I 711b25,
cf. also [[AN5.83]] at AN I 266,4), which would rather be due to the influx of sensuality. Again, the denial of causality attributed to Pūra�a Kassapa in [[DN2]] at DN I 52,22, or the position associated in the
same discourse with Ajita Kesakambalī or Sañjaya Bela��hiputta (cf. [[DN2]] at DN I 55,15 and DN I
58,24) would probably be related to the influx of ignorance, cf. also Thomas 1927/2003: 67 note 2, who
reasons that to the three influxes “was later added false view (di��hi), as a development of avijjā”. Thus
the arising of views could be related to each of the three influxes, so that the idea of an influx of views
seems to be more than just making explicit what was already implicit in the influx of becoming. Although to reckon the di��hāsava as a fourth influx appears to be clearly a later development, its inclusion in listings of influxes could claim for support a proposal made in [[MN2]] at MN I 9,22 and its parallel [[MA10]] at T I 432b6. These two discourses agree on referring to the eradication of the three lower
fetters, which includes the eradication of the fetter of “personality view” (sakkāyadi��hi/ ), as “influxes to be removed by seeing”, āsavā dassanā pahātabbā, . Thus, at least in this instance
the term “influx” does refer, among others, to personality view. From this it would not seem too farfetched to assume that the influx of views should be reckoned as a fourth type of influx.
218 Such an understanding could perhaps reflect the more general use of the etymologically related verb
anvāssavati, a verb which the discourses regularly employ to highlight that the purpose of sense-restraint is to avoid the “flowing in” of evil unwholesome states, e.g., [[MN27]] at MN I 180,30: pāpakā
akusalā dhammā anvāssaveyyu�. [[MN2]] at MN I 10,3 and its parallel [[MA10]] at T I 432b13 reckon such
sense-restraint to be the way to “remove influxes through restraint”, āsavā sa�varā pahātabbā,
, thereby further supporting the relationship between anvāssavati and āsava, found in a context where
āsava also seems to have a rather general sense. 身見
219 [[MN70]] at MN I 478,20+31: paññāya c’ assa disvā ekacce āsavā parikkhī�ā honti. 漏從見斷 Pp 15,16 gives a
stronger emphasis on the wisdom factor in the case of the noble disciple “liberated by faith”, since it
indicates that this noble disciple has “understood through wisdom and penetrated the teachings declared
by the Tathāgata”, tathāgatappaveditā c’ assa dhammā paññāya vodi��hā honti vocaritā, just as is the
case for the noble disciple “attained to view”. [[MN70]] at MN I 478,21 uses the same qualification only
when defining the noble disciple “attained to view”. To distinguish these two noble disciples, Pp 15,18
then adds that the eradication of some influxes through wisdom in the case of the noble disciple “liberated by faith” is “not like that of one attained-to-view”, na ca kho yathā di��hippattassa. The expression 漏從護
斷 dhammā paññāya vodi��hā honti vocaritā recurs in [[AN9.5]] at AN IV 363,16 as part of a definition of
paññābala, the “power of wisdom”. Thus this expression does stand representative for the development
of deeper levels of insight and understanding.

384   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


According to the Madhyama-āgama version’s presentation, the difference between
these two noble disciples is that one who has “attained-to-view” has contemplated the
Dharma with outstanding wisdom and acceptance, while one who is “liberated-byfaith” does not have these qualities to the degree to which they are possessed by a noble disciple “attained-to-view”. [221]

MN I 479  The Madhyama-āgama version repeats the same definition in regard to the Dharmafollower (dhammānusārī) and the faith-follower (saddhānusārī). This could be a textual error, since on this reading there would be no difference between the one attainedto-view and the Dharma-follower, or between the one attained-to-faith and the faithfollower. [222] A similar exposition of the seven types of noble disciple, found in a discourse in the Sa�yukta-āgama, agrees in fact closely with the Madhyama-āgama presentation of the first five, but presents the last two in terms similar to the Kī�āgiri-sutta,
thereby supporting the impression that the Madhyama-āgama version may have suffered from a textual error.
The Sa�yukta-āgama presentation of the Dharma-follower and the faith-follower
agrees with the Kī�āgiri-sutta on highlighting that both are endowed with the five faculties (indriya). The Sa�yukta-āgama discourse points out that whereas in the case of
the Dharma-follower the faculty of wisdom is strong, in the case of the faith-follower it
is weaker. [223]
The Kī�āgiri-sutta expresses the same distinction in slightly different terms. It indicates the difference between them to be that the Dharma-follower has sufficiently accepted the Tathāgata’s teachings with wisdom, while the faith-follower has sufficient
faith and affection for the Tathāgata. [224] Other Pāli and Chinese discourses add that
these two noble disciples differ not only in regard to the particular faculty they have
emphasized in their development, but also in that the Dharma-follower has developed
the whole set of five faculties to a superior degree than the faith-follower. [225]

221 [[MA195]] at T I 751c12 explains that the one attained-to-view has “relied on wisdom, superior insight
and superior acceptance”,, while the one-liberated-by-faith does not have
these qualities in the same degree, T I 751c23: .
222 The only difference in the respective definitions is that whereas [[MA195]] at T I 751c16+28 predicts full
liberation for diligent practice undertaken by someone attained-to-view and someone liberated-by-faith,
in the case of the Dharma-follower and the faith-follower [[MA195]] at T I 752a11+22 envisages that they
may either reach full liberation or else non-return.
223 [[SA936]] at T II 240a29: and T II 240b4: ; cf. also [[SA61]] at T II 16a6+8, where the distinction between the two similarly revolves around in contrast to just .
224 [[MN70]] at MN I 479,7: tathāgatappaveditā c’ assa dhammā paññāya mattaso nijjhāna� khamanti, and
MN I 479,21: tathāgate c’ assa saddhāmatta� hoti pemamatta�. The same two expressions recur in
[[SN55.24]] at SN V 377,13+21 便以慧, and in [[SN55.25]] at SN V 379, 增上觀, 增上忍 13+20 in what are references to these two
noble disciples, even though they are not explicitly mentioned. In [[MN22]] at MN I 142, 以慧, 觀, 忍, 不如見到 8, however, the
expression saddhāmatta� pemamatta� qualifies a stage below the dhammānusārī and the saddhānusārī, as it refers to those who by dint of their faith are destined to a heavenly rebirth. The decisive difference between this stage and the saddhānusārī would be that the latter has developed the five faculties.

A whole Sa�yutta, the Okkantika-sa�yutta, delineates the difference between these
two disciples. It specifies that the Dharma-follower accepts with wisdom impermanence,
while the faith-follower is convinced of it. [226] This presentation shows that a faith-follower is not only one who has faith in the Tathāgata, but also one who is convinced of
his teachings.
According to the Puggalapaññatti, the difference between these two types of disciple
is that the Dharma-follower places wisdom first in his or her development, while the
faith-follower places faith first. [227]
The Abhidharmakośabhā�ya explains that Dharma-followers pursue the truth in a selfreliant manner, guided in their meditation and practice mainly by their own study of the
scriptures. In contrast, faith-followers undertake the same under the guidance of another person as their teacher. [228]
What emerges from these presentations is that, although faith-followers rely on the
faculty of faith, they nevertheless also develop wisdom, even though they do so to a
lesser degree than Dharma-followers.
The Kī�āgiri-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel continue by declaring that final
knowledge comes about through a gradual path of training. The two versions agree that
this gradual training begins with an initial degree of faith. Such faith then leads to:

 - visiting,

 - being respectful,

 - listening to the teachings,

 - bearing the teachings in mind,

 - examining their meaning,

 - coming to accept them.
The Majjhima-nikāya version continues at this point with four more steps, which are:

 - [wholesome] desire,

 - energetic acting,

 - examination,

 - striving. [229]


226 [[SN25.1-10]] at SN III 225-228, which presents the impermanent nature of the senses, their objects, the
respective type of consciousness, etc., as something in regard to which the saddhānusārī “has faith and
is resolved”, saddahati adhimuccati (e.g., [[SN25.1]] at SN III 225,9), while the dhammānusārī “has sufficiently accepted them with wisdom”, paññāya mattaso nijjhāna� khamanti (e.g., [[SN25.1]] at SN III
225,16).
227 Pp 15,22 highlights that in the case of a dhammānusārī there is a predominance of wisdom, paññāpubba�gama� ariyamagga� bhāveti, while in the case of a saddhānusārī the development of the noble
path takes place with a predominance of faith, saddhāpubba�gama�.

the faith-follower proceeds based on the instructions received from others, Pradhan 1950: 88,12: paropadeśamanusm�tya and T 1606 at T XXXI 754b11: ; cf. also the Śrāvakabhūmi, Shukla 1973:

In contrast to these four steps, the Madhyama-āgama version speaks of only one more
step, which is to contemplate and examine the teachings. [230] The two versions agree in
presenting personal realization as the final step in this series. [231]
When comparing this difference between the two version’s depiction of the gradual
approach to final knowledge, the Kī�āgiri-sutta can be seen to give additional emphasis
to the factors of [wholesome] desire, energetic action, and striving, thereby describing
the inspiration and commitment required for progress to liberation in more detail than
its Madhyama-āgama counterpart. This brings to mind a difference already noted above
between the two versions, where in the description of the seven noble disciples the Madhyama-āgama presentation gives more emphasis to the factor of wisdom, while its Majjhima-nikāya counterpart puts the highlight more on the faculty of faith.

MN I 480  The Kī�āgiri-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel continue with the Buddha announcing the impending delivery of a four-phrased statement. This statement begins by
noting that the attitude of Assaji and Punabbasuka would not be proper even if they
had a teacher intent on material gains, not to speak of behaving as they did with a
teacher like the Buddha, who is totally detached from material things. [232] According to
both versions, the proper attitude for a faithful disciple would be to keep in mind that
the Buddha is the teacher, while they are just his disciples. [233]
The Majjhima-nikāya version continues this reflection with the thought that the Buddha knows, whereas they, as disciples, do not know, [234] a reflection not found in the
Madhyama-āgama version. Instead, the Madhyama-āgama discourse records the faithful disciple’s wish to benefit from the Buddha’s teaching of the Dharma. [235]

(the Sa�yukta-āgama edition vol. 4 appendix p. 34 lists [[SA659]] at T II 184a8-19 as a parallel, yet

[[MN71]] Tevijjavacchagotta-sutta [1]

The Tevijjavacchagotta-sutta, the “discourse to Vacchagotta on the three higher knowledges”, records the Buddha’s declaration that he had not made a claim to omniscience.
Of this discourse, so far no parallel appears to have been identified. [2]


[[MN72]] Aggivacchagotta-sutta [3]

The Aggivacchagotta-sutta, the “discourse to Vacchagotta on the fire [simile]”, has
as its main theme the nature of a Tathāgata. This discourse has two Chinese counterparts in two Sa�yukta-āgama collections, [4] and a Tibetan counterpart in Śamathadeva’s
commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya. [5]
The Aggivacchagotta-sutta and its parallels begin by relating that the wanderer Vacchagotta questioned the Buddha on a standard set of views that were apparently a subject of regular discussion in ancient India. [6] The topics taken up in this standard set of
views are:

1 Be-M II 148,1 has the title Tevijjavaccha-sutta, while Se-M II 236,1 has the title Cū�avacchagotta-sutta.
In this way, the Siamese edition of [[MN71]] forms the counterpart to [[MN73]] the Mahāvacchagotta-sutta,
while in the other Pāli editions [[MN73]] remains without a cū�a counterpart.
2 Warder 1970/1991: 137 comments that “we ought probably to admit this sūtra as an authentic part of the
earliest Tripi�aka, but likely to have been suppressed by most Buddhists of later times as offensive to their
traditions of the greatness of their teacher”; a brief survey of [[MN71]] can be found in Anālayo 2008g.
3 Be-M II 149,13 has the title Aggivaccha-sutta.
4 The parallels are [[SA962]] at T II 245b-246a and [[SA2]] 196 at T II 444c-445c. While [[MN72]] takes place in
Jeta’s Grove by Sāvatthī, [[SA962]] and SĀ [2] 196 take place in the Squirrels’ Feeding Ground by Rājagaha.
Anesaki 1908: 137 gives [[SA962]] the title “view(s)”,, which is how SĀ [2] 196 is referred to in an uddāna at T II 447b10. A discourse similar in some respects to [[MN72]] is [[SN44.1]] at SN IV 374-380, which
also examines the standard set of views apparently discussed regularly in ancient India and illustrates the
impossibility of applying them to the Tathāgata with the help of the image of the deep ocean. [[SN44.1]]
differs from [[MN72]] in as much as it has King Pasenadi and the nun Khemā as its protagonists. [[SN44.1]]
reports that, after the encounter between the two, King Pasenadi approached the Buddha and repeated his
questions, receiving the same replies as he had received earlier from Khemā. [[SN44.1]] also differs from
[[MN72]] in that it does not make use of the fire simile, a simile that appears to be such a distinctive mark
of [[MN72]] that it was chosen as the discourse’s title.

  - the world’s eternity,

  - the world’s finiteness,

  - the identity of body and soul,

  - the destiny of a Tathāgata after death. [7]
In the Pāli account, these four topics amount to ten views, since the three propositions concerned with the world’s eternity, the world’s finiteness, and the identity of
body and soul could either be affirmed or negated and thus count up to six, whereas the
destiny of a Tathāgata after death is proposed in four different modes, according to the
so-called tetralemma. These four modes cover not only affirmation and negation, but
also the position “yes-and-no” and the position “neither-yes-nor-no”.
The two Sa�yukta-āgama versions and the quotation in Śamathadeva’s commentary
apply the tetralemma not only to the destiny of a Tathāgata, but also to the world’s
eternity and to the world’s finiteness. [8] By presenting three topics in a fourfold mode
and only the identity of body and soul in a dual mode, the Sa�yukta-āgama versions
arrive at fourteen views (see table 8.1).
An application of the tetralemma to the world’s eternity and finiteness can be found
not only in other discourses in the two Sa�yukta-āgamas, but also in discourses from
the Dīrgha-āgama. [9] Discourses in the Madhyama-āgama and in the Ekottarika-āgama,
however, present each of these two topics only in a two-fold manner, similar to the

7 The significance of these topics in the ancient Indian setting would be reflected in a passage in the Jain
Viyāhapa��atti 9.33 in Lalwani 1985: 103-105, where a Jain monk’s claim to having become a jina is investigated by another Jain monk. This investigation takes place by querying the claimant whether the
world is eternal or not, and whether the soul is eternal or not. As the claimant is unable to reply to these
queries, his claim to having reached the final goal has been proven to be wrong. This is then followed by
Mahāvīra giving the answers that these questions are held to require, namely that the world and the soul
are eternal in one sense and not eternal in another sense. On parallelisms between Vacchagotta’s questions and the Ka�ha Upani�ad cf. also Nakamura 1983b: 23-25.
8 [[SA2]] 196 differs from [[SA962]] in as much as, after mentioning that the world could be either eternal, or not
eternal, or both eternal and not eternal, it depicts a fourth alternative according to which the world is “not
eternal [and] not impermanent, not not eternal [and] not not impermanent”, T II 445a12:
. This appears to be a textual error, in fact the same fourth alternative at a later point in SĀ [2]
196 at T II 445a29 reads simply: “not eternal [and] not impermanent”, . The same pattern recurs
in relation to the fourth position on the world’s finiteness, where SĀ [2] 196 at T II 445a16 mentions
, but then continues with, yet a recapitulation of the same position in SĀ [2]
196 at T II 445b1 just reads . Again, in its counterpart to the examination of the future
destiny of a Tathāgata SĀ [2] 196 at T II 445a19 reads, which in this case, however, is also the formulation used later at T II 445b2. A variation can also be found in Abhidh-k-�, where
Vacchagotta omits to mention the possibility that the world could be neither finite nor infinite, D (4094)
mngon pa, ju 157a4 or Q (5595) tu 181b1, although this possibility is taken into account in the Buddha’s

In regard to the destiny of a Tathāgata after death, one of the two Sa�yukta-āgama
parallels to the Aggivacchagotta-sutta speaks of the destiny of the “self of beings” or
the “soul of beings”. [12] This presentation parallels an explanation found in the Pāli commentarial tradition, which understands occurrences of the word Tathāgata in the context of this fourfold presentation to stand for a “living being”. [13]
From the perspective of textual transmission, it is noteworthy that the formulation of
the tetralemma in one of the Sa�yukta-āgama discourses corresponds to this commentarial understanding of the term Tathāgata. Perhaps an ancient Indian commentary that
was similar to the commentarial gloss preserved in Pāli influenced the Sa�yukta-āgama discourse’s formulation.
Continuing with the comparative study of the Aggivacchagotta-sutta, once the Buddha had declined to take up any of these different views, Vacchagotta asked what dan

11 Abhidh-k 5:22 in Pradhan 1967: 292,8: caturdaśāvyāk�tavastūni, introduced as a teaching from the discourses; cf. also T 1558 at T XXIX 103a21: and T 1559 at T XXIX 256c17:
. Thus, as noted by Jayatilleke 1963/1980: 471, while “only ten questions
are mentioned in the Pāli Canon ... in the Buddhist Sanskrit literature ... the list is extended to fourteen”.
12 [[SA2]] 196 at T II 445a18: .
13 E.g., Sv I 118,1: satto tathāgato ti adhippeto. This explanation seems to be standard for commenting on
the tetralemma, cf. also Ps III 141,21: tathāgato ti satto, a formulation found similarly in Spk II 201,4
and Mp IV 37,22; on this commentarial gloss cf. also Gnanarama 1997: 236-237, Karunadasa 2007: 712, and Manda 2005. When it comes to occurrences of the term Tathāgata in contexts not related to the
tetralemma, the commentaries record two possible meanings, namely either a living being in general or
else an arahant, cf., e.g., Ps II 117,13: satto pi tathāgato ti adhippeto, uttamapuggalo khī�āsavo pi, an
understanding also reflected in Nidd-a I 193,24 諸契經中說十四無記事 and Pa�is-a II 453,24: tathāgato ti satto, arahan ti eke.

ger the Buddha saw in these propositions. According to the Pāli and the Tibetan versions, the Buddha explained that to get entangled in these views does not lead to Nirvā�a. [14] The two Sa�yukta-āgama versions make the same point by declaring that such
entanglement will lead to future birth, old age, and death. [15]

MN I 486  Asked by Vacchagotta if he held any view, the Buddha replied that he had done away
with all resorting to views (di��higata), as he had seen (di��ha) what leads to liberation.
While according to the Aggivacchagotta-sutta the Buddha’s “vision” consisted in seeing
the impermanent nature of the five aggregates, [16] in the two Sa�yukta-āgama discourses
and in the Tibetan version his vision concerns the four noble truths. [17]
According to one of the Sa�yukta-āgama versions, the Buddha explained that a monk
with such vision cannot be said to reappear, nor can it be said that he does not reappear. [18]
According to the other Sa�yukta-āgama version, the Buddha simply pointed out that
such a monk will not come back to existence in any of the three realms. [19] Both of the
Chinese versions indicate that Vacchagotta asked for further explanations of this statement.
The Pāli and the Tibetan versions report, however, that Vacchagotta had on his own
inquired after the reappearance of such a monk. According to the Pāli account, he formulated his inquiry in the same tetralemma mode he had used earlier for the future destiny of a Tathāgata.
The Pāli version records that the Buddha’s denial of all four alternatives caused Vacchagotta’s bewilderment, a reaction the Buddha attributed to the fact that Vacchagotta
was following a different type of teaching and practice. [20] Such an exchange between the
Buddha and Vacchagotta, or a reference to his following a different practice, is not
found in the other versions.


14 [[MN72]] at MN I 485,28 and D (4094) mngon pa, ju 157b2 or Q (5595) tu 181b8. Regarding the Buddha’s
refusal to take up any of the four modes of predicating the destiny of a Tathāgata after death, Karunadasa 1994: 8 points out that “to predicate whether something exists or not one should be able to identify
it ... [but] there is no identifiable self-entity called Tathāgata, either to be perpetuated or annihilated after
‘death’”, wherefore any statement made about a Tathāgata after death becomes meaningless. For a survey of scholarship on the Buddha’s position regarding these questions cf. Vélez de Cea 2004b: 120-125.
15 [[SA962]] at T II 245c10 and [[SA2]] 196 at T II 445a23.

17 [[SA962]] at T II 245c22, [[SA2]] 196 at T II 445b9, and D (4094) mngon pa, ju 157b6 or Q (5595) tu 182a7.

.
20 [[MN72]] at MN I 487,7. A similar remark, indicating that the more profound aspects of the Buddha’s
teaching are difficult to understand for someone who follows a different type of teaching and practice,
recurs in several other discourses that similarly present the Buddha in discussion with a wanderer, cf.
[[DN9]] at DN I 187,13 and its parallel [[DA28]] at T I 110c29, [[DN24]] at DN III 35,3 and its parallel [[DA15]]
at T I 70a15, or [[MN80]] at MN II 43,11 and its parallel [[MA209]] at T I 787b2. Another occurrence of this
remark, found in [[DN25]] at DIII 40,8, is absent from its parallels [[DA8]] at T I 47c6 and [[MA104]] at T I
592a26.

The Aggivacchagotta-sutta and its parallels agree in illustrating the nature of the Tathāgata after death with the example of an extinguished fire. [21] Once a fire has gone out,
it is not possible to point out the direction to which the fire has gone. Similarly, the Tathāgata has abandoned each of the five aggregates, like a cut off palm tree unable to
grow again.
The Aggivacchagotta-sutta continues by noting that the four modes of the tetralemma are not applicable to the Tathāgata, who is profound and unfathomable like the
ocean. [22] This explanation and the image of the ocean are not recorded in the other versions. One of the two Sa�yukta-āgama discourses does, however, mention the qualities “profound” and “boundless”, apparently referring to the Tathāgata, so that a similar
statement could have been found in an earlier version of this discourse and may have
been lost during the course of transmission or translation. [23]
The four versions agree that Vacchagotta compared the Buddha’s teaching to a strong
tree trunk, divested of branches and foliage. [24] While in the Pāli version Vacchagotta
took refuge and became a lay disciple, according to the Chinese versions he left without taking refuge. [25]


[[MN73]] Mahāvacchagotta-sutta [26]
The Mahāvacchagotta-sutta, the “greater discourse to Vacchagotta”, records how the
wanderer Vacchagotta decided to go forth and became an arahant. This discourse has
two Chinese parallels in two Sa�yukta-āgama collections, [27] and another parallel in [[AN21]] [[MN72]] at MN I 487,11, [[SA962]] at T II 245c28, [[SA2]] 196 at T II 445b17, and D (4094) mngon pa, ju
158a2 or Q (5595) tu 182b2. Interpretations of this simile can be found in, e.g., Harvey 1990: 66-67,
Ñā�ananda 2010, and Thanissaro 1993: 41; cf. also Siderits 1979: 496.
22 [[MN72]] at MN I 487,35. Harvey 1983: 35 examines this passage with the help of [[SN44.1]] at SN IV
376,11; cf. also Tilakaratne 1993: 78-79.
23 After declaring that a re-arising of someone who has abandoned the five aggregates cannot be predicated,
[[SA962]] at T II 246a10 continues like this: “profound, vast, boundless, innumerable, forever ceased”,
, after which the Buddha’s explanation ends. The implications of this statement receive no further explanation, so that they might be qualifying the Tathāgata, similar to the parallel passage
in [[MN72]]
24 While [[MN72]] at MN I 488,28 indicates that this tree was “big”, mahā, according to [[SA962]] at T II 246a13
the tree was several thousand years old,, according to SĀ [2] 196 at T II 445c3 the tree was a hundred-thousand years old,, and according to D (4094) mngon pa, ju 158b1 or Q (5595) tu 183a3
the tree was innumerable many years old, lo du ma zhig ci la grangs mang du. These variations show
how even minor circumstances can fall prey to successive stages of aggrandizement. Another difference
is that [[SA962]] does not speak of a tree, but rather of a forest,, a reading also found in an Uighur fragment that parallels the present passage, cf. Kudara 1995: 27. 甚深,
25 [[SA962]] at T II 246a 廣大, 無量, 無數, 永滅 17 and [[SA2]] 196 at T II 445c8; Abhidh-k-� does not report either his departure or his
going for refuge.
26 Be-M II 156,25 has the title Mahāvaccha-sutta.
27 The parallels are [[SA964]] at T II 246b-247c and [[SA2]] 198 at T II 446a-447b. [[SA964]] agrees with [[MN73]]
on locating the discourse in the Squirrels’ Feeding Ground by Rājagaha, while SĀ 數千歲 [2] 198 simply mentions

discourse quotation that is found in an Abhidharma treatise preserved in Chinese translation. [28]

MN I 489  The Mahāvacchagotta-sutta begins by describing that the wanderer Vacchagotta approached the Buddha and requested a teaching in brief on what is wholesome and what
is unwholesome. In reply, the Buddha contrasted the three mental roots of unwholesomeness with their wholesome counterparts, illustrating both with the corresponding
ten courses of action.
The Sa�yukta-āgama versions report the Buddha’s exposition in similar terms, although they differ to some extent in their narration of what took place beforehand. According to them, Vacchagotta had asked the Buddha three times if he could put a question to him, but the Buddha had remained silent each time. [29] Vacchagotta then asked
the Buddha why he remained silent, in fact according to one of the Sa�yukta-āgama
versions he remarked that he had been on friendly terms with the Buddha for a long
time. [30]
Notably, a somewhat similar remark occurs also in the Mahāvacchagotta-sutta. [31]
While in this version the reasons for this statement by Vacchagotta are not clear and
his remark appears to be just a way of beginning their conversation, in the Sa�yuktaāgama version Vacchagotta’s remark stands in a more meaningful context, as it is part
of an effort to persuade the Buddha to answer Vacchagotta’s question.
According to the Sa�yukta-āgama versions, when the Buddha finally agreed to answer Vacchagotta’s question, he made a point of indicating that he would just give a
teaching in brief on this subject. [32] This additional qualification naturally follows the
Buddha’s initial silence, which already would have indicated that, from his perspective,
the present occasion was not appropriate for longer discussions.


Rājagaha as the location, without further specifications. Anesaki 1908: 137 gives [[SA964]] the title
“going forth”, an expression that is also found in an uddāna at T II 447b11 as a way of refering to
SĀ [2] 198. As was the case with the Sa�yukta-āgama parallels to [[MN72]] the version found in the complete Sa�yukta-āgama translation (T 99), [[SA964]] at T II 246b13, agrees with [[MN73]] on introducing the
Buddha’s interlocutor as the wanderer Vacchagotta,, while the version found in the ‘other’
Sa�yukta-āgama translation (T 100), SĀ [2] 196 at T II 446a11, presents the protagonist of the present
event as, on which cf. above p. 389 note 6.
28 This is the, which according to the information given in the Taishō edition was translated
by Paramārtha. The relevant part is found in T 1482 at T XXIV 963a14-965a4 (noted as a parallel by
Chung 2008: 197), which mentions Rājagaha as the location and introduces its protagonist as the heterodox practitioner Vacchaputta, .

198 at T II 446a 佛阿毘曇經 23 and T 1482 at T XXIV 963b1, the Buddha indicated that he was going to teach in
brief even though he would be able to expound this subject in detail, similar to a remark he made according to [[MN73]] at MN I 489,15: “I could teach you in detail”, vitthārena pi kho te aha� ... deseyya�.

The Mahāvacchagotta-sutta, however, reports that it was Vacchagotta who had asked
to be given only a teaching in brief. In reply, the Buddha explained that, although he
would be able to teach this topic in brief and in detail, he would agree to Vacchagotta’s
request and teach only in brief. [33] Thus, while in the Sa�yukta-āgama versions the Buddha had on his own decided that he would only give a brief exposition, and that after
initially refusing to get involved in a discussion at all, in the Majjhima-nikāya version
it was in order to comply with Vacchagotta’s explicit request that the Buddha decided
to give only a brief answer to his visitor’s query.
According to other Pāli discourses, Vacchagotta had come with his questions to the
Buddha or some of his disciples on numerous occasions, [34] so that the Buddha’s attitude
in the Sa�yukta-āgama parallels to the Mahāvacchagotta-sutta could be seen as a teaching device to restrain Vacchagotta’s inquisitive habit.
An instance of this device can in fact be found in a discourse in the Sa�yutta-nikāya
and its parallels, which report that on another occasion the Buddha remained silent and
did not reply at all to a question posed by Vacchagotta. [35] The Buddha’s attitude depicted
in these discourses would be similar to the account given in the Sa�yukta-āgama parallels to the Mahāvacchagotta-sutta, according to which on the present occasion the
Buddha was also somewhat hesitant to engage in a discussion with Vacchagotta.
The Pāli commentary’s gloss on the present passage devotes some space to discussing the nature of brief and detailed expositions, explaining that the seven works of the
Abhidharma should be considered as teachings “in brief”. [36] What makes this remark
noteworthy is that the Chinese versions also refer to the Abhidharma. This reference
comes as part of their description of what went on in the Buddha’s mind before he allowed Vacchagotta to put his question. According to both versions, the Buddha decided to listen to or to reply to Vacchagotta’s question according to or by way of Abhidharma and Vinaya. [37]
This specification is puzzling. The reference to the Abhidharma together with the Vinaya would correspond to a frequently found phrase in the Pāli discourses, which speaks
of abhidhamma abhivinaya. [38] In such contexts, the prefix abhi- appears to have mainly

the meaning “pertaining to” or “related to”, so that abhidhamma would stand for what
“pertains to the Dharma”. [39] Yet, for the Buddha to reflect that he would listen to a question in a way that pertains to the Dharma or the Vinaya seems curious, since it is difficult to imagine how he could be depicted as doing otherwise. Besides, the topic of
Vacchagotta’s inquiry and the ensuing exposition given by the Buddha involve rather
basic teachings on wholesome and unwholesome conduct, hence the later meaning of
Abhidharma as a form of profound analysis of deeper aspects of the teaching would
also not fit the present context.
Thus, the most natural explanation of the occurrence of this specification in the Chinese versions would be that it could have originated from a remark on the Abhidharma,
presumably as representative of teachings in brief, made in an ancient Indian commentary on this discourse, similar to the remark now found in the Pāli commentary.
Continuing with the comparative study of the Mahāvacchagotta-sutta, after expounding the three roots and the ten courses of action, the Pāli and Chinese versions take up
the case of a monk who has reached liberation. The Chinese versions provide a transition to this topic by indicating that to understand the three roots and the ten courses of
action in accordance with reality forms the basis for being able to eradicate the influxes
and reach liberation. [40]

MN I 490  According to the Mahāvacchagotta-sutta and its parallels, Vacchagotta next inquired
after the existence of realized disciples. [41] Finding out that large numbers of the Buddha’s disciples had reached distinction, males as well as females, with monastics reaching levels of awakening up to full liberation and laity up to non-return, Vacchagotta
came to the conclusion that the Buddha’s teaching was complete in every respect. [42]

MN I 493  The Pāli version reports that Vacchagotta illustrated this completeness by comparing
the way the river Ganges inclines and flows to the ocean to the way the disciples of the
Buddha are inclined towards Nirvā�a, an image that recurs frequently in other Pāli discourses. [43] Instead of the Ganges imagery, the Chinese versions illustrate how the disciples of the Buddha advance towards Nirvā�a with the example of how the water of a
great rain flows downwards. [44] One of the Sa�yukta-āgama versions further enhances


39 Cf. the discussion in Geiger 1920: 118-119, Horner 1941: 298, van Zeyst 1959: 64, and von Hinüber
1996/1997: 64; cf. also above p. 213 note 50.
40 [[SA964]] at T II 246c3, [[SA2]] 198 at T II 446a29, and T 1428 at T XXIV 963b6.
41 A comparable inquiry addressed to Mahāvīra regarding the level of realization of disciples can be found
in the Viyāhapa��atti 5.4.59 in Lalwani 1974: 165,7, although the inquirers in this instance are gods and
the conversation takes place purely on the mental level.
42 On the levels of awakening attainable by laity cf. also above p. 373 note 176.
43 This is the case to such an extent that a recurring passage in the Sa�yutta-nikāya, which uses this image
in order to illustrate how various aspects of the Dharma lead to Nirvā�a, is called the Ga�gāpeyyāla, the
“Ganges repetition”. This “Ganges repetition” occurs at the end of the Magga-sa�yutta at SN V 38, and
is then repeated at the end of the Bojjha�ga-sa�yutta at SN V 134 and SN V 137, at the end of the Satipa��hāna-sa�yutta at SN V 190, at the end of the Indriya-sa�yutta at SN V 241, at the end of the Balasa�yutta at SN V 251, and at the end of the Iddhipāda-sa�yutta at SN V 290.

this image by indicating that the disciples advance in such a way due to receiving the
‘rain’ of the Buddha’s teaching. [45]
The Mahāvacchagotta-sutta and its parallels record in similar ways that Vacchagotta
requested to be ordained, in reply to which the Buddha explained a standard practice
according to which followers of other sects need to go through a probation period of
four months before they are given full ordination. [46] The parallel versions agree that,
nevertheless, Vacchagotta was soon admitted to the order. [47]
Not long after his ordination, Vacchagotta went to the Buddha to receive further instructions. According to all versions, Vacchagotta made it clear that he had accomplished what was to be done by a disciple in higher training, an expression the commentary explains to imply that he had become a non-returner. [48]
According to the Pāli account, the Buddha instructed Vacchagotta to train himself
further in tranquillity and insight, indicating that training in this way has the potential


45 [[SA2]] 198 at T II 446c19: .
46 According to [[MN73]] at MN I 494,10, Vacchagotta proclaimed that he would undergo a probation period
for four years, a proposition which Horner 1957/1970: xvi considers to be slightly exaggerated. T 1428
at T XXIV 964a4 agrees with [[MN73]] In SĀ [2] 198 at T II 446c25, however, Vacchagotta only states that,
even if he had to wait for four years he would do so, what to say about four months. In [[SA964]] at T II
247a26 he just states that he is willing to undergo a four months’ probation period. [[SA964]] at T II 247a20
and T 1428 at T XXIV 963c26 also indicate that the Buddha’s statement on the standard procedure regarding ordination of followers of other sects was prompted by an inquiry by Vacchagotta, as he had
asked about the time period required for heterodox wanderers to get ordained.
47 Regarding such going forth after a probation period, the description in [[MN73]] at MN I 494,3 reads as if
the going forth is to be given only after the four months are over, 蒙佛法雨 catunna� māsāna� accayena ... pabbājenti. Dhirasekera 1982/2007: 220 notes that this stands in contrast to the description of the probation
period in Vin I 69,11, according to which the probationer should be shaved and clothed in robes. SĀ [2]
198 at T II 446c22 seems to agree in this respect with the Theravāda Vinaya account, as it also indicates
that the probationer should be shaved before the probation period begins, . In fact, for other
monks to be able to assess the sincerity of a probationer, it would be convenient if the latter were to live
in close association with them, which would be facilitated if he were given some degree of going forth.
That is, the probationer would need to receive at least some form of pabbajā, so that he could set out
begging alms with shaven head and wearing the robes of a Buddhist monastic, as keeping his former
style of dress and hair would create a somewhat awkward situation for him as a freshly converted Buddhist in front of the donors. Hence, the formulation in [[MN73]] should perhaps not be taken too literal.
Thus, the point of the probation period would be, as explained by Olivelle 1974: 69, that “during this
period the new recruit was excluded from the official acts of the community”, a situation thus “similar
to the penal parivāsa by which a monk guilty of an offence was [temporarily] excluded from full communion with the community”. Deo 1956: 143 notes that in the Jain tradition a probation period had to be 先剃其鬚髮
observed in general before being admitted to the monastic community, lasting either a week, or four
months, or six months. According to Prasad 1972a: 89, there was, however, no special procedure for the
case of those who had earlier been members of a different sect.

Vacchagotta proclaims that “in regard to what a sekha needs to know ... I know it all”,
, and in SĀ [2] 198 at T II 447a5 he declares that “in regard to the stage of a sekha, I have already
realized it all”, cf. also T 1428 at T XXIV 964a18

of leading to the attainment of the six supernormal knowledges. The Chinese versions
present a broader range of benefits, as, in addition to the six supernormal knowledges, [49]
they list:

  - the four jhānas,

  - the four brahmavihāras,

  - the four immaterial attainments,

  - the three lower stages of realization (see in more detail table 8.2).
Regarding the reference in the Chinese versions to the three lower stages of realization, i.e. to the attainments of stream-entry, once-return, and non-return, [50] it is noteworthy that, according to the description given in all versions of Vacchagotta’s development at this point, he had already attained at least stream-entry, if not more. Thus,
this part of their list of benefits appears to some degree redundant, as it mentions levels
of attainment that he would have already reached.

49 The list of the six abhiññās in [[SA664]] appears somewhat jumbled, as [[SA664]] at T II 247b23 speaks first
of the “divine eye”, but after listing three other supernormal knowledges refers to the same divine
eye again in terms of “knowledge of the birth and death [of beings]”, . This duplication would
not be required and also stands in contrast to other discourses in the same Sa�yukta-āgama, which list
the six abhiññās in the same sequence as the Pāli discourses, without any such duplication, cf., e.g., [[SA814]] at T II 209b10, [[SA815]] at T II 209c27, [[SA1042]] at T II 273a23, and [[SA1142]] at T II 302a25. In the
case of SĀ [2] 198 at T II 447a16, another noteworthy circumstance is that this discourse presents the divine eye and the divine ear together as a single supernormal knowledge, . This could be an abbreviation of, an expression used in the same discourse collection in SĀ [2] 117 at T II 417a19.

The four versions report that Vacchagotta eventually realized the final goal. [51] He then
sent a message conveying his accomplishment to the Buddha, who in reply indicated
that he already knew about Vacchagotta’s progress and had also been told about it by
devas.


[[MN74]] Dīghanakha-sutta

The Dīghanakha-sutta, the “discourse to Dīghanakha”, examines views and feelings,
an examination during which the wanderer Dīghanakha became a stream-enterer and
Sāriputta an arahant. This discourse has two parallels in two Sa�yukta-āgama translations, [52] and another parallel in the Pravrajyāvastu of the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya. [53]


51 [[MN73]] at MN I 496,31, [[SA964]] at T II 247b28, [[SA2]] 198 at T II 447a22, and T 1428 at T XXIV 964c26.
52 The discourse parallels are [[SA969]] at T II 249a-250a and [[SA2]] 203 at T II 449a-b. While [[MN74]] takes
place at Mount Vulture Peak near Rājagaha, [[SA969]] and SĀ [2] 203 have the Squirrel’s Feeding Ground
near the same Rājagaha as their location. Anesaki 1908: 137 lists [[SA969]] under the title “Dīghanakha”,
, a title used in an uddāna at T II 453b19 to refer to SĀ [2] 203. A variation on the Pāli version’s title
can be found in the Pāli commentaries, which refer to this discourse as the Vedanāpariggaha-suttanta,
the “discourse on comprehending feelings” (cf. Sv II 418,19, Ps IV 87,7, Spk II 234,8, Mp I 161,7, Dhpa I 96,9, and Th-a III 95,22). In the early discourses, pariggaha refers to “acquisition”, which would not
result in a meaningful title for the present discourse. The title Vedanāpariggaha-sutta appears to be
rather based on a sense pariggaha acquired later, in the post-canonical period, as “comprehension” or
even “investigation”, cf., e.g., the gloss given in B [e] -Vibh-m� 32 on the expression pariggahe �hito as
vīma�sāya �hito; cf. also Ñā�amoli 1994: 69, who lists “discerning” for pariggaha. Thus this alternative
title for [[MN74]] appears to be a commentarial coinage. Another discourse given to a different person with
the same name as the protagonist of [[MN74]] is the “discourse on the query of the Brahmin Dīghanakha”,

Several parts of the present discourse have also been preserved in Sanskrit fragments. [54]
Versions of the present discourse can also be found in the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-(upadeśa-)śāstra, [55] in the *Mahāvibhā�ā, [56] and in the Avadānaśataka. [57]

MN I 497  The Dīghanakha-sutta and its parallels report that the wanderer Dīghanakha came to
visit the Buddha and presented his view. [58] Additional narrative background to this meeting is provided in the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-(upadeśa-)śāstra, the *Mahāvibhā�ā, and
the Avadānaśataka, which report that Dīghanakha had been displeased or even irritated
on hearing that his close relative Sāriputta, whom he respected for his intelligence, had
become a disciple of another teacher. [59] This would explain the slightly provocative nuance that appears to underlie the way he presents his view to the Buddha in the discourse
versions.


389, who collates the Sanskrit text with its Chinese and Tibetan counterparts. This discourse relates how
a Brahmin visitor by the name of Dīrghanakha inquired from the Buddha about the karmic causes for
various physical qualities of the Buddha (in some respects similar to [[DN30]] at DN III 145-179). Thus,
as already noted by Sander 1979: 62, this discourse has little in common with [[MN74]] as “only in the
introduction to the sūtra are there any similarities and the locality is the same”. Another reference can be
found in the Chinese Udāna-(varga), which mentions a discourse spoken to the Brahmin Dīghanakha, a
discourse it allocates to the Dīrgha-āgama, cf. T 212 at T IV 736c28.
53 The relevant section of the Tibetan Pravrajyāvastu has been edited in Eimer 1983: 96-105. Its Chinese
counterpart, T 1444 at T XXIII 1028c4-15, is abbreviated and gives only the beginning part of the encounter between the Buddha and Dīghanakha.
54 The Sanskrit fragments can be found in Pischel 1904: 814-816 or Hosoda 1989b: 144-151. The close correspondence of these fragments to [[SA969]] was noticed soon after their publication by Lévi 1904: 299.

in this tale cf. also Feer 1882: 339. Oldenberg 1912b: 178 highlights the close similarity between the
Sanskrit fragments in Pischel 1904 and the Sanskrit Avadānaśataka tale.
58 As Wagle 1966: 49 explains, Dīghanakha is a nickname, alluding to his “long nails”. A reference to his
name has also been preserved in an Uighur fragment in Kudara 1995: 28. According to the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-(upadeśa-)śāstra, T 1509 at T XXV 61c5, the *Mahāvibhā�ā, T 1545 at T XXVII 509b22,
and the Pravrajyāvastu in Dutt 1984d: 22,1 and folio 6r1 in Vogel 1992: 79, this wanderer was called
Dīghanakha or Dīrghanakha because he did not cut his finger nails (according to the otherwise unrelated
[[EA34.4]] at T II 694a12, to keep the nails long was one of five characteristics of contemporary recluses
and wanderers). SĀ [2] 203 at T II 449a5 differs from the other sources in so far as it introduces its protagonist as . It is a recurring characteristic of this Sa�yukta-āgama collection (T 100) that it
uses for what in the parallel versions are wanderers, as the same recurs also in the parallels to [[MN72]] and [[MN73]] SĀ [2] 196 and SĀ [2] 198, cf. above p. 389 note 6 and p. 394 note 27. In the present case, this
specification would fit the context, as all versions reckon Dīghanakha a close relative of Sāriputta, so that
he would indeed stem from a Brahmin family. According to Goshima 2008: 332, however, it is also quite
possible that in the present context renders parivrājaka, cf. also Karashima 2001: 88 s.v. .

The Majjhima-nikāya version reports that Dīghanakha made the proclamation that he
did not approve of anything. [60] According to one of the Sa�yukta-āgama versions, his
proposition was that he did not approve of any view, while according to the other Sa�yukta-āgama version he did not approve of any teaching. [61]
Dīghanakha’s proposition in the Sanskrit fragment, in the Tibetan Pravrajyāvastu, in
the *Mahāvibhā�ā, and in the Sanskrit and Tibetan versions of the Avadānaśataka tale is
as brief as the Pāli statement. [62] The way the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-(upadeśa-)śāstra
and the Chinese Pravrajyāvastu record his statement, however, is more elaborate and
thus resembles more closely the Sa�yukta-āgama versions. [63]
The Pāli commentary suggests that Dīghanakha was an annihilationist and hence his
proclamation implied that he did not approve of any kind of rebirth. [64] The formulation
in one of the Sa�yukta-āgama discourses, however, suggests that his refusal referred to
views or doctrines. [65] This much seems to be also implicit in the reply the Buddha gave
to Dīghanakha’s proclamation in all versions, since tongue in cheek he asked his visitor if this refusal to approve of anything also included Dīghanakha’s own view. [66] The
humour underlying the Buddha’s reply is lost when Dīghanakha’s proposition is seen
as only being concerned with modes of rebirth.
The Majjhima-nikāya version reports Dīghanakha replying that it would not matter if
he were to approve of his own view. [67] According to the Sa�yukta-āgama versions, the


60 [[MN74]] at MN I 497,26: sabba� me na khamatī ti (Be-MN II 165,13: nakkhamatī ti), literally “all is not
bearable to me”, which in the present context would have the sense “I do not approve of anything”.
61 [[SA969]] at T II 249b3: “I do not approve of any view”,, and [[SA2]] 203 at T II 449a6: “in
regard to all teachings, I do not approve of any”, . The character means literally
“to bear, to endure, to put up with” and thus closely corresponds to khamati or k�amati and to their equivalent bzod do used in the Tibetan Pravrajyāvastu; cf. also Hirakawa 1997: 467, who begins his list of
equivalents for with k�ānti and k�ama.
62 Fol. 162a5 in Pischel 1904: 814: sarva� me na k�amati, the Tibetan Pravrajyāvastu in Eimer 1983:
96,13: bdag ni thams cad mi bzod do, the *Mahāvibhā�ā, T 1545 at T XXVII 509c9:, and
the Avadānaśataka in Speyer 1909/1970: 187,10 or in Vaidya 1958a: 256,7: sarva� me, bho Gautama,
na k�amata iti, with its Tibetan counterpart in bdag ni thams cad mi ’tshal lo in Devacandra 1996: 710,9
(the Chinese avadāna tale does not record his statement).
63 According to the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-(upadeśa-)śāstra 我一切見不忍, T 1509 at T XXV 62a3, he proclaimed: “I do
not approve of any teachings”, (adopting the 於一切法, 悉不忍受, and variant reading 忍 instead of
), thereby bringing in the notion of teachings found also in SĀ [2] 203. In the Chinese Pravrajyāvastu, T
1444 at T XXIII 1028c5, his proposition is more elaborate: “any of my [own] teachings, or the holding
of a corresponding view, all that I do not desire 忍 ”, .
64 Ps III 204,3 (as a gloss on his position): “all [types of] arising are not approved of by me ... I am an annihilationist”, sabbā me upapattiyo nakkhamanti ... ucchedavādo ’ham asmī ti. 我一切不忍
65 [[SA969]] at T II 249b3:, although a and variant reading does not mention the “view”, .
66 Fuller 2005: 154 explains the purpose of this inquiry to be that “the Buddha is attempting to find out
how this view is being held. Is Dīghanakha’s view a non-position, its aim to overcome all cognitive standpoints, or is Dīghanakha holding to this view?”. Premasiri 2006a: 186 notes that “Dīghanakha's position
could itself become a dogma. For if one dogmatically holds the view ‘I agree with no view’, it can have 我一切法不忍 元, 宮 石 忍
受 the same consequences as taking any other dogmatic position”.

Tibetan Pravrajyāvastu, the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-(upadeśa-)śāstra, and the Sanskrit
and Tibetan Avadānaśataka tale, however, he affirmed that he also did not approve of
his own view. [68] One of the two Sa�yukta-āgama versions reports that the Buddha followed up this inconsistency by asking Dīghanakha why he had proclaimed a view he
did not approve of. [69] In fact, according to the *Mahāvibhā�ā, already on the Buddha’s
first question Dīghanakha realized his self-contradictory position and remained silent. [70]

MN I 498  The parallel versions continue by examining three possible variations of this type of view,
which could be:

       - to approve of all,

       - to approve of nothing,

       - to approve of some and to disapprove of some.
The Pāli and Chinese discourses, the Sanskrit fragments, the Tibetan Pravrajyāvastu,
and the Sanskrit and Tibetan versions of the Avadānaśataka tale point out that to hold
any of the three possible variations of this view will lead to dispute with those who take
a different position on this matter. [71]

MN I 500  The Dīghanakha-sutta and its parallels next turn to the nature of the human body,
made up of the four elements. The Pāli version recommends contemplating the body


still be the same”, esā ce me ... di��hi khameyya, ta� p’ assa tādisam eva, ta� p’ assa tādisam evā ti (S [e]       MN II 263,10: ta� pi ’ssa).
68 [[SA969]] at T II 249b5: “this view, I also do not approve of”,, [[SA2]] 203 at T II 449a8: “I also
do not approve of a view like this”, . According to the Tibetan Pravrajyāvastu in
Eimer 1983: 96,16, he proclaimed that “I also do not approve of this view”, lta ba de yang mi bzod do,
with its Chinese counterpart in T 1509 at T XXV 62a14: “that view I also do not approve”,
(adopting again the variant reading instead of ). The Avadānaśataka in Speyer 1909/1970: 187,11
or in Vaidya 1958a: 256,8 similarly reads “this view is also not approved by me”, e�ā pi me ... d���ir na
k�amate, with the Tibetan counterpart lta ba gang lags pa ’di yang bdag mi ’tshal lo in Devacandra 1996:
710,12.
69 [[SA2]] 203 at T II 449a9: “if you do not approve of such a view, why did you proclaim it”,
?
70 T 1545 at T XXVII 509c13, cf. also Dhammajoti 2004: 192. The Chinese 此見亦不忍 Avadāna account, T 200 at T
IV 256a14, similarly reports that he remained silent, although according to its report this happened after 如此之見, 我亦不忍
the Buddha had pointed out that Dīghanakha’s view did not lead to Nirvā�a. According to T 200, Dīghanakha continued to remain silent three times, at which point a thunderbolt wielding spirit intervened and 是見亦不忍
forced him to reply to the Buddha. T 200 then continues differently from the other versions and does not 忍 受
report the instructions on contemplation of the body and feelings at all.
71 [[MN74]] at MN I 498,17 indicates that to approve of all is closer to attachment than to disapprove of all, a
position similarly taken in fol. 163a4 in Pischel 1904: 814 (cf. Hosoda 1989b: 146), [[SA969]] at T II 249b17,
the Tibetan Pravrajyāvastu in Eimer 1983: 97,12, the Avadānaśataka in Speyer 1909/1970: 188, 汝若不忍如是 11 or in
見者, Vaidya 1958a: 256, 何故而言 20, with its Tibetan counterpart in Devacandra 1996: 711,19, and the *Mahāvibhā�ā,
T 1545 at T XXVII 509c24. The Sanskrit fragment, [[SA969]] the Tibetan Pravrajyāvastu, the Avadānaśataka, and the *Mahāvibhā�ā differ from [[MN74]] at MN I 498,21 in as much as they do not report that
Dīghanakha drew the conclusion that the Buddha commended his view. SĀ [2] 203 at T II 449a24 differs
from the other versions, as according to its presentation all three types of view, including the disapproval of everything, are related to attachment and aversion and will therefore obstruct progress towards
liberation.

from a standard set of eleven perspectives, which revolve around the three characteristics of impermanence, dukkha, and not-self. [72] The Sa�yukta-āgama discourses, the Tibetan Pravrajyāvastu, and the Sanskrit and Tibetan version of the Avadānaśataka tale
present contemplations of the body that involve the related topics of impermanence,
dispassion, and relinquishment. [73]
After describing contemplation of the body, the Dīghanakha-sutta and its parallels
turn to contemplation of feelings. The Majjhima-nikāya account begins examining this
topic by clarifying that the three types of feeling are mutually exclusive. [74] Instead of
taking up the mutually exclusive nature of the three types of feeling, the Sa�yuktaāgama versions highlight that feelings arise in dependence on contact and cease with
the cessation of contact. [75]
The Tibetan Pravrajyāvastu and the Sanskrit and Tibetan versions of the Avadānaśataka tale agree with the Pāli discourse on taking up the mutually exclusive nature of the
three feelings. [76] The same works also mention the dependency of feelings on contact,
in this respect resembling the Sa�yukta-āgama versions. [77]
The Dīghanakha-sutta and its parallels continue by directing awareness to the impermanent and conditioned nature of feelings, to which the Sanskrit fragment, one of

the Sa�yukta-āgama versions, and the Sanskrit Avadānaśataka version add awareness
of the gratification, the danger, and the escape in regard to feelings. [78]
The two Sa�yukta-āgama discourses, the Sanskrit fragment, the Tibetan Pravrajyāvastu, and the Sanskrit and Tibetan versions of the Avadānaśataka tale also turn to the
feelings to be experienced when life comes to an end.
Although this particular perspective on feelings occurs frequently in other Pāli discourses concerned with contemplation of feelings, [79 ] it does not form part of the instructions in the Dīghanakha-sutta. The Majjhima-nikāya version also stands alone in reporting that the Buddha made a pronouncement on the type of speech used by an arahant. [80]

MN I 501  The parallel versions report that Sāriputta, who had been present during this discourse,
reached full awakening, while Dīghanakha became a stream-enterer. [81] The Majjhimanikāya version indicates that Sāriputta became an arahant once he had realized that the
Buddha’s instruction aimed at abandonment through direct knowledge. [82]

78 [[SA969]] at T II 249c15: “he knows in accordance with reality how [feelings] arise, how [they] cease,
how [they provide] gratification, how [they are beset by] danger, and how to escape [from them]”,
. Fol. 165a4-5 in Pischel 1904: 815: cāsvāda� cādīnava� ca ni�(sara�a�) and yathābhūta� prajāna�, indicating that the Sanskrit version also took up the gratification, danger, and escape in relation to feelings. The same formulation is also found in the Sanskrit Avadānaśataka tale in Speyer 1909/1970: 193,1 or in Vaidya 1958a: 258,3.
79 [[MN140]] at MN III 244,33, [[SN12.51]] at SN II 83,1, [[SN22.88]] at SN III 126,14, [[SN36.7]] at SN IV 213,10,

268,4 adds kho before loke). This statement recurs in Nidd I 284,9 and Nidd I 303,28 as a quote from the
present discourse; on its implications cf., e.g., Katz 1982/1989: 218. A similar proposition can also be 若集,
若滅, found in [[DN9]] at DN I 202, 若味, 若患, 若出, 如實知 8.
81 [[SA969]] at T II 249c26 and [[SA2]] 203 at T II 449b21 further specify that at the time of this event Sāriputta
had been a monk for half a month,, a specification made also in the Tibetan Pravrajyāvastu in
Eimer 1983: 104,6, in the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-(upadeśa-)śāstra, T 1509 at T XXV 61c17, in the
*Mahāvibhā�ā, T 1545 at T XXVII 510b1, and in the Sanskrit and Tibetan Avadānaśataka in Speyer
1909/1970: 194,1 or in Vaidya 1958a: 258,15 and in Devacandra 1996: 717,14; cf. also the survey of
sources related to Sāriputta’s going forth and awakening in Migot 1952: 426-443. The Mahāvastu also
associates his full awakening with the Dīrghanakhaparivrājaka-sūtra, cf. Basak 1968/2004: 40,19 or
Senart 1897: 67,7, as does Xuánzàng ( ) in his travel records, T 2087 at T LI 925a10, translated in
Beal 1884/2001b: 179. The same Mahāvastu in Basak 1968/2004: 40,12 or in Senart 1897: 66,17 also
reports, however, that Śāriputra and Mahāmaudgalyāyana attained awakening during an instruction
given to them by the Buddha right after their ordination, an instruction similar to an exposition given in
[[MN28]] at MN I 190,20 by Sāriputta. The 半月 Mahāvastu’s suggestion that the two attained full awakening
together stands in direct contrast to a specification given in the same passage in Basak 1968/2004:
40,14+16 or in Senart 1897: 67,2+3 that it took Mahāmaudgalyāyana a week to awaken, while Śāriputra
achieved the same in two weeks. As the two ordained together, this passage in the Mahāvastu appears to
conflate two different and to some degree conflicting accounts, something not uncommon in this work,
cf. also above p. 175 note 157.

Chapter 8 Paribbājaka-vagga                                     -  405


The Sa�yukta-āgama versions, the Sanskrit fragment, the Tibetan Pravrajyāvastu,
and the Sanskrit and Tibetan versions of the Avadānaśataka tale present the same event
more in terms of actual meditation practice. According to their report, Sāriputta became
an arahant by practising contemplation of impermanence and thereby developing dispassion. [83]
The Majjhima-nikāya account concludes by reporting that Dīghanakha became a lay
follower of the Buddha. According to the Chinese and Sanskrit discourses, however, and
according to the Tibetan Pravrajyāvastu, he requested ordination and in due turn became an arahant. [84] The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-(upadeśa-)śāstra, as well as the Chinese,
Sanskrit, and Tibetan Avadānaśataka tale similarly report that Dīghanakha became a
monk and eventually an arahant. [85]
This would be a more natural presentation, since after becoming a stream-enterer it is
difficult to imagine Dīghanakha continuing to live on as a non-Buddhist wanderer or
even to revert to lay status, so that for him to become a Buddhist monk would be the
most reasonable course of action to be taken at this point. [86]
According to the Sanskrit Avadānaśataka tale and the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-(upadeśa-)śāstra, after going forth Dīghanakha was known by the name of Ko��hila or Ko��hita. [87] In fact, once he had ordained as a Buddhist monk, Dīghanakha would have cut
his fingernails, so that the use of the sobriquet “long nail” could indeed fall out of use.

promptly realised freedom from passion, [thereby] discarding and relinquishing all views”,
. Fol. 166a5 in Pischel 1904: 815 similarly refers to contemplating dispassion, virāgānupaśyino. According to the Tibetan Pravrajyāvastu in Eimer 1983: 104,21, Śāriputra
reached full awakening after contemplating the relinquishment of all phenomena, dispassion, extinction,
and complete relinquishing, chos de dang de dag la spong bar rjes su lta zhing gnas pa dang, ’dod

86 Freiberger 1997: 128, in his survey of the usage of the term paribbājaka in the Pāli discourses, comes to
the conclusion that there is no evidence for the existence of any Buddhist paribbājakas; cf. also Karunaratna 2004b: 318. Thus a Buddhist who “goes forth”, or one “gone forth” who turns Buddhist, would presumably both become members of the Buddhist monastic order.

Thus, from the perspective of Avadānaśataka tale and the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā(upadeśa-)śāstra, the wanderer Dīghanakha and the monk Mahāko��hita appear to be
the same person.
This identification stands in contrast to the Pāli commentarial tradition, which reckons Mahāko��hita and Dīghanakha as two different persons. However, closer inspection
reveals some internal inconsistencies in the commentarial presentation. [88]
In sum, the wanderer Dīghanakha might indeed be identical with the monk Mahāko��hita, a suggestion that would also provide a meaningful background to the close relationship between Mahāko��hita and Sāriputta and their frequent discussions recorded
elsewhere in the discourses.


1912b: 178 note 3; cf. also Feer 1891: 425 note 3. The Tibetan (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya in Eimer
1983: 95,15+17 also refers to him as stod rings, which Panglung 1981: 303 lists as a rendering of the
name Ko��hila.
88 According to the Therāpadāna, Ap 534:23 at Ap II 480,17, the parents of Mahāko��hita were Assalāyana
and Candavatī, whereas according to Ps III 203,17 Sāriputta was Dīghanakha’s maternal uncle, mātula,
i.e., Dīghanakha was the son of Sāriputta’s sister, cf. also Ps IV 87,6: sāriputtathero ... bhāgineyyassa
dīghanakhaparibbājakassa. Sāriputta is recorded to have had three sisters, Cālā, Upacālā, and Sisūpacālā, all of which, according to Dhp-a II 188,16, went forth (cf. also their verses at Thī 182-203 and [[SN5.6-8]] at SN I 132-134 or SN [2] 167-169 at SN [2] I 290-294). Thī-[[AN159.21]] indicates that, before going forth,
Cālā, Upacālā, and Sisūpacālā each had a son and each of these sons was given the same name as his
respective mother, a name under which each of them went forth (cf. also Th-a I 117,15). Thus, none of
the three sisters seems to be identifiable as the mother of Dīghanakha, so that the commentarial presentation of Dīghanakha as a son of a sister of Sāriputta appears to lack support from the information provided in the same commentarial tradition. According to several other works, Dīghanakha was in fact
Sāriputta’s uncle, cf. the Pravrajyāvastu in Dutt 1984d: 23,13 and folio 6r9-10 in Vogel 1992: 80 (which
record the names given to the son of Dīghanakha’s sister as Upati�ya and Śāriputra), the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-(upadeśa-)śāstra, T 1509 at T XXV 61c11, the *Mahāvibhā�ā, T 1545 at T XXVII 509c3, and
the Avadānaśataka in Speyer 1909/1970: 187,3 or Vaidya 1958a: 255,26, T 200 at T IV 256a9, and Devacandra 1996: 709,7. This, however, does not fully solve the situation either, as according to the Sanskrit and Tibetan Avadānaśataka tales in Speyer 1909/1970: 186,7 or in Vaidya 1958a: 255,20 and in
Devacandra 1996: 709,6, the father of Dīrghanakha and his sister Śāri (= Śāriputra’s mother) was called
Ma�hara (ma tha ra). Lamotte 1944/1981: 47 note 1 points out that this would not fit with the parents
the Therāpadāna at Ap II 480,17 attributes to Mahāko��hita, according to which his father was Assalāyana. Yet, this attribution seems also to be beset with difficulties, since at the time of the Assalāyanasutta, [[MN93]] at MN II 147,10, Assalāyana was only sixteen years old. This discourse seems to have
taken place at a later stage of the Buddha’s ministry, when his teaching had become generally known,
since [[MN93]] takes its occasion from a group of Brahmins who want to challenge the Buddha on his
proclamation of purification of all four social classes, cātuva��a suddhi. The identity of the Assalāyana
mentioned in this discourse and the one referred to in the Apadāna can be seen in the next Apadāna
verse, according to which the Buddha converted Assalāyana by a teaching on purification for all, vinayī
sabbasuddhiyā (following B [e] -Ap II 132,26, whereas E [e] reads sabbabuddhiyā), a reference that evidently
refers to the discussion in [[MN93]] Following the Apadāna account, then, Mahako��hita would have been
the son of a Brahmin who at the time of the delivery of the Assalāyana-sutta was only sixteen years old,
a presentation that seems less probable than the assumption that he could have been identical with Dīghanakha. In sum, as this little excursion into ‘historical’ information amply shows, the indications given in
the various sources on family relationships, etc., are at times not easily reconciled with each other.

[[MN75]] Māgandiya-sutta

The Māgandiya-sutta, the “discourse to Māgandiya”, examines the disadvantages of
sensual pleasures. [89] This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama. [90]
The Māgandiya-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel describe in similar ways
how the wanderer Māgandiya chanced upon a place prepared for the Buddha to stay
overnight. On being told by the Brahmin landlord that this place was meant for the
Buddha, Māgandiya expressed his displeasure by calling the Buddha a “destroyer”. [91]
According to the Majjhima-nikāya account, Māgandiya asserted that he would repeat
the same statement in the presence of the Buddha, after which the Brahmin asked
Māgandiya’s permission to report the term used by Māgandiya to the Buddha. [92] The
Madhyama-āgama discourse adopts the opposite sequence, as in its version the Brahmin first asked Māgandiya if the expression he had used may be reported to the Buddha, in reply to which Māgandiya asserted that he would have no qualms to repeat the


89 The title Māgandiya-sutta recurs for a discourse in the Sutta-nipāta, [[SN35.16]] at [[SNP835-847]] whose protagonist Māgandiya unsuccessfully attempts to offer his beautiful daughter to the Buddha. Ps III 209,23
explains that the wanderer Māgandiya of [[MN75]] was the nephew of the Māgandiya in [[SN35.16]] at [[SNP835847]] According to Pj II 543,2, the Māgandiya in [[SN35.16]] was a Brahmin, according to a parallel in the
Divyāvadāna in Cowell 1886: 515,14, or in Vaidya 1999: 446,3, this Māgandiya (spelled Mākandika)
was also a wanderer; the same holds for a Sanskrit fragment counterpart to [[SN35.16]] in Hoernle 1916: 714715, where fragment IIIr1 reads māgandikasya parivrājakasya, cf. also fragment IIr5. [[SN22.3]] at SN III
12,20 refers to the Sutta-nipāta version of the Māgandiya-sutta as the Māgandiyapañha from the A��hakavagga.
90 The parallel is [[MA153]] at T I 670a-673a, which agrees with [[MN75]] on locating the discourse in the
Kuru country and also uses the name of the main protagonist as the title,, although the Indic
name of the visitor to the Buddha would have been different (Pulleyblank 1991: 304, 335, and 348 gives
su&•γε _:n_ _d_ ε _j_ as the Early Middle Chinese pronunciation of ). For a summary account of the beginning and concluding sections of [[MA153]] cf. Minh Chau 1964/1991: 61-62 and 185.
91 [[MN75]] at MN I 502,15: bhūnahuno (Se-MN II 271,3: bhūnahanassa), a “destroyer of beings” or a “destroyer of growth”, with its counterpart in [[MA153]] at T I 670b17: (at T I 670b24: ); a
reference to the present discourse in Mil 314,1 reads bhūtahacco. Bodhi in Ñā�amoli 1995/2005: 1281
note 740 draws attention to the commentarial gloss at Ps III 211,4 as hatava��hino, “destroyer of increase”, and mariyādakārakassa, “maker of limitations”, in support of taking bhūnahuno to refer to the
destruction of “growth”. According to Barua 1921/1981: 355, “Māga��iya judged Buddha to be an
exterminator of the human race”. Bhagwat 1946: 64 explains that “the word means ‘one who 鬚閑提經 destroys
(or suppresses) by his teachings the essential nature of Beings, which consists of their primary and
fundamental instincts and emotions’”. Horner 1946: 287 understands the term to refer to 鬚閑提 “a slayer of
creatures, or ‘rigid repressionist’”, Horner 1957/1970: 181 then translates the term as “destroyer of
growth”, while Law 1931/2004b: 97 glosses it as a “killer of the embryo” and id. 1933: 141 takes the
term as referring to a “repressionist”, as does Chalmers 1926: 354, 壞敗地 adding the qualification 敗壞地 “rigid”.
Saksena 1936: 713 notes that “būnaha most certainly corresponds to Skt. bhrū�ahan-, bhrū�aghna- ‘the
killer of an embryo, one who produces abortion’”; cf. also Alsdorf 1965: 46-47 and Norman 2004: 81.
Vetter 2000: 132 note 45 explains bhūnahuno to intend that “the Buddha is ... a person who prevents
children from being conceived”. According to [[SNP3.10]] at [[SNP664]] the Buddha used the same expression
in regard to Kokālika, a follower of Devadatta.

same statement himself in the presence of the Buddha. [93] A need for the Brahmin to inform the Buddha did anyway not arise, as according to both versions the Buddha had
overheard the conversation between Māgandiya and the Brahmin with his divine ear. [94]
Soon after the Buddha had come back to the Brahmin’s place, Māgandiya came to
join them. According to both versions, the Buddha inquired whether it was due to his
practice of sense-restraint that Māgandiya considered him to be a “destroyer”, which
Māgandiya affirmed. In the Majjhima-nikāya version, Māgandiya supported his statement by declaring that this was recorded to be so in the discourses of his tradition, [95] a
remark without a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama version. The Pāli commentary ex
93 [[MA153]] at T I 670b21.
94 While according to [[MA153]] at T I 670c8 the Brahmin simply attributed the Buddha’s telepathic knowledge of the conversation between the Buddha and Māgandiya to the fact that the Buddha was fully
awakened, according to [[MN75]] at MN I 503,2 the Brahmin was awe struck and his hair stood on end
when the Buddha made it clear that he already knew what had been said. Another difference is that
while [[MN75]] at MN I 502,31 simply reports that the Brahmin came to greet the Buddha and then sat
down, [[MA153]] at T I 670c1 precedes the same with a description of the beautiful sight of the Buddha,
who was just like the moon surrounded by stars, emanating a bright light like a golden mountain,
. This description is a recurrent pericope in the Madhyama-āgama, found in,
e.g., [[MA20]] at T I 445b13 (parallel to [[SN42.13]]), [[MA28]] at T I 460b11 (parallel to [[MN143]]), and [[MA38]]
at T I 479c18 (parallel to [[AN8.21]]), [[MA152]] at T I 667a13 (parallel to [[MN99]]), and as a description of
Kassapa Buddha in [[MA63]] at T I 500c21 (parallel to [[MN81]]). Minh Chau 1964/1991: 37 comments that
this image “strikes a rather exaggerated note, unknown to the moderate attitude of early Buddhism”.
Similar images are a recurrent feature in other texts. Thus, for example, in the Mahāvastu in Basak
1965: 67,8 or in Senart 1890: 47,15 the sight of the young bodhisattva seated in meditation under the
Jambu tree with unmoving shadow causes his father to compare the splendour of his son to a moon
surrounded by stars, śaśīva nak�atraga�āvakīr�o, differing in so far as instead of a golden mountain,
this passage in the Mahāvastu speaks of a sacrificial fire on a mountain top, hutāsano vā girimūrdha 猶星  中月, nasmi� 光耀煒曄, . The Lalitavistara 晃若金山 in Hokazono 1994: 542,2 or in Lefmann 1902: 132,13 or in Vaidya 1958b:
92,14 similarly reports that the bodhisattva’s father made use of the image of the moon surrounded by
stars and of the fire on a mountain top on that occasion. The Divyāvadāna combines the simile of a
sacrificial fire with that of a golden mountain in a series of images to describe the splendour of the Buddha, cf. Cowell 1886: 158,24 or Vaidya 1999: 98,9. The fire imagery recurs in ancient Indian art, where
at times the first meditation under the Jambu tree is depicted with a fire representing the bodhisattva, cf.
Stache-Weiske 1990: 110. The image of the moon surrounded by stars recurs again in the Mahāvastu in
Basak 1965: 274,14 or in Senart 1890: 196,13 as part of a description of the bodhisattva soon after he
had set out on his spiritual search, nak�trairiva candramā�, a verse preceded by comparing him to a
golden post, kā�canastambhasad�śo, cf. Basak 1965: 274,11 or Senart 1890: 196,10. The same image
can also be found in the Mahāvastu in Basak 1968/2004: 70,23 or in Senart 1897: 115,5 in the context of
the first meeting between the Buddha and his father. The image of a golden post occurs also in the Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1977: 150,1, which compares the outer appearance of the Buddha to a golden

Cowell 1886: 198,21 and 516,13 or in Vaidya 1999: 123,14 and 446,19.

S [e] ) could have been part of or perhaps even leader of a particular group of wanderers suggests itself
from [[AN5.298]] at AN III 276,32, which mentions the Māga��ikas in a listing of contemporary wanderers, comprising also the Niga��has, Ja�ilakas, Paribbājakas, etc.

plains that Māgandiya made this remark to show that he had some authority on which
he could rely when accusing the Buddha of being a “destroyer”. [96]
The Māgandiya-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel continue by contrasting the
enjoyment of sensual pleasures with the aloofness from their attraction that can be accomplished by going forth and overcoming sensual desire. A difference between the
two versions is that the Majjhima-nikāya discourse at this point describes how the bodhisattva used to live in three mansions, spending the rainy season period in the company of female musicians. [97] Such a way of life not mentioned at all in its Madhyamaāgama parallel, which only reports a statement by the Buddha that in his lay life he had
had easy access to the five types of sensual pleasure. [98]
The two versions illustrate the Buddha’s disinterest in sensual pleasures with the example of a householder who has been reborn in a celestial realm and enjoys celestial
pleasures, thereby automatically losing any interest in the types of sensual pleasure this
householder formerly had at his disposal, when he was still a human being. [99]
The Māgandiya-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel continue by illustrating the
nature of sensual pleasures with the help of a similar series of similes concerned with a
leper, although the two versions differ in regard to the sequence in which they present
these similes (see table 8.3).


Table 8.3: Similes to Illustrate Sensual Pleasures in [[MN75]] and its Parallel

The Madhyama-āgama version begins by describing a leper who scratches his wounds
and cauterises them over a fire, even though his wounds will only get worse by being
scratched and cauterised. The discourse then compares this behaviour to indulging in
sensual pleasures, as indulgence will likewise only increase craving for sensual pleas

97 [[MN75]] at MN I 504,24. The Mahāvastu in Basak 1965: 161,11 or in Senart 1890: 115,8 describes in detail the furnishings of these three palaces and other supplies meant for the bodhisattva’s entertainment.
98 [[MA153]] at T I 671a24: “I obtained the five types of sensual pleasure, which I obtained easily, without
difficulty”, . Bareau 1974a: 214 compares this part of [[MN75]] with [[MA153]] and
concludes that [[MA153]] offers the more original presentation.
99 In his reply to this proposition by the Buddha, according to [[MA153]] at T I 671b13 Māgandiya qualified
human sensual pleasures to be “smelly” and “impure”, and . This does not seem to fit too well
with his earlier criticism of the Buddha, which would have been based on some form of approval of
their enjoyment. The same qualification fits, however, as part of the Buddha’s conclusion after the series
of similes on sensual pleasures in [[MA153]] at T I 672a25. This suggests that this qualification originally
belonged only to the Buddha’s statement. Perhaps due to an error during the process of transmission or
at the time of translation, it then also became part of Māgandiya’s statement in [[MA153]] at T I 671b13.

ures. Next the Madhyama-āgama discourse illustrates the same principle with the example of a king. In spite of all the sensual gratification a king has at his command, he
will not be able to experience mental peace free from desire for sensual pleasures.
The Madhyama-āgama account then turns to the case of a leper whose leprosy has
been healed. Such a healed leper would lose all interest in the temporary relief experienced by another leper who cauterises his wounds over a fire. Taking up the case of a
healed leper again, the Madhyama-āgama version depicts how this leper, on being
dragged forcefully close to a fire, will try all he can to avoid the fire.
In reply to this image, Māgandiya explained that the reason the leper earlier experienced the heat of the fire as pleasant was due to his “distorted perception”. [100] In a similar way, the Madhyama-āgama version explains, beings have a distorted perception
when they search for happiness through sensual pleasures, as sensual pleasures are in
reality painful to touch, impure, and smelly. [101]
The corresponding similes in the Majjhima-nikāya version begin with the healed leper
seeing another leper cauterising his wounds. Next comes the image of the healed leper
who is dragged forcefully close to a fire, followed by describing how the leper’s wounds
get worse by scratching and cauterising. The last image in the Majjhima-nikāya discourse then is the simile of the king.
This sequence appears jumbled, since in this way the example of the king comes almost as an anticlimax after the powerful images related to the healed leper. The Madhyama-āgama version, in contrast, presents a logical build-up of the argument, as it begins by clarifying the predicament of the leper, then applies this to beings in general
and to a king in particular, followed by turning to a healed leper’s attitude to the fire he
had formerly found so attractive, an attitude it presents in an ascending series by proceeding from his disinterest in using the fire for cauterisation to his actual fear of being
forcefully dragged to the fire.

MN I 508  According to both versions, the Buddha concluded his exposition with a stanza in praise
of health as the highest gain and Nirvā�a as the highest happiness. [102] Māgandiya expressed his approval of the stanza spoken by the Buddha, as this stanza was also known
in his tradition. Being asked by the Buddha what he took to be Nirvā�a, Māgandiya
pointed to his body in reply, proclaiming this to be health and Nirvā�a. [103] According to

無病第一利, 涅槃第一樂


Chapter 8 Paribbājaka-vagga                                     -  411


the Majjhima-nikāya version, he explained his proposition further by indicating that he
was healthy and happy. [104]
The Māgandiya-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel report that the Buddha was
quick to point out that Māgandiya had misunderstood the nature of Nirvā�a, a misunderstanding similar to a blind man who has been cheated into wearing a dirty and soiled
garment, believing it to be clean and spotless. The Buddha then repeated his stanza on
health as the highest gain and Nirvā�a as the highest happiness together with another
stanza, in which he drew attention to the eightfold path as the best of paths, since it will
safely lead to the deathless. [105]
While in the Madhyama-āgama version this is the first time the Buddha pronounces
the second stanza on the eightfold path, according to the Majjhima-nikāya version he
had already done so when speaking the stanza on Nirvā�a as the highest happiness for
the first time.
When evaluating this difference, the reference to the eightfold path would not be required for the first utterance of the stanza on Nirvā�a as the highest happiness, which
led to the discussion with Māgandiya on the nature of Nirvā�a. If the Buddha had at
that point already mentioned the need of the noble eightfold path in order to reach Nirvā�a, one would not expect Māgandiya to assert self-confidently a type of Nirvā�a that
obviously does not require any such path.
At the present junction of events, however, when the point is to clarify that Māgandiya’s notion of Nirvā�a is mistaken, a reference to the noble eightfold path fits the
context well, thereby indicating that a path of practice is required to attain this Nirvā�a.
This hint seems to have had its effect, since in both versions Māgandiya requests that
the Buddha teaches him how he might get a vision of Nirvā�a. This request would
have been caused by the fact that the Buddha has just highlighted the need for a path to
Nirvā�a. In view of this, the Madhyama-āgama presentation suits the progression of
ideas well, in the sense that at first the Buddha only spoke a stanza on Nirvā�a. When
Māgandiya had expressed his misunderstanding of the nature of Nirvā�a, however, the
Buddha also brought up the noble eightfold path.
If this should be the more original version, then the Majjhima-nikāya version’s presentation could easily be the result of a transmission error, as during the course of oral
tradition a reciter might accidentally employ the full version of the stanza at the earlier
point, where originally only the lines on Nirvā�a and health were required.
The Majjhima-nikāya and Madhyama-āgama versions agree that the Buddha replied
to Māgandiya’s request to be led to Nirvā�a with the simile of a blind man. While the
Madhyama-āgama discourse only notes that someone born blind would not be able to
see colours, the Majjhima-nikāya presentation of the same simile also describes an un

successful attempt to cure the blind man. [106] The two versions continue by describing a
successful attempt to cure the blind man, who once healed will realize that he had been
cheated into wearing a dirty and soiled garment, believing it to be clean and spotless.

MN I 511  The Majjhima-nikāya version applies this image to the five aggregates, indicating that
with the vision of Nirvā�a, Māgandiya would similarly realize that by grasping at the
five aggregates he has just been cheating himself, a passage not found in its Madhyama-āgama parallel. Instead, the Madhyama-āgama version notes that the blind man,
once he has been healed, would be able to see his dirty garment for what it really is.
Similarly, by purifying the noble eye of wisdom, Māgandiya would be able to see Nirvā�a for himself. [107]

MN I 512  In order for Māgandiya to acquire a vision of Nirvā�a, according to the Majjhima-nikāya version he should fulfill the following requirements:

       - frequent worthy men,

       - listen to the Dharma,

       - practise accordingly. [108]
The Madhyama-āgama version presents the same in a fourfold manner, as it adds the
need for proper attention to the three aspects mentioned in the Majjhima-nikāya version. [109] Other Pāli discourses similarly stipulate these four requirements for being able
to reach various stages of awakening. [110]
According to the Madhyama-āgama account, the Buddha thereon gave an exposition
of the four noble truths, during which Māgandiya attained stream-entry. [111]
The Majjhima-nikāya version instead reports a teaching given by the Buddha on dependent arising in its cessation mode. [112] The Majjhima-nikāya version also differs in so


106 [[MA153]] at T I 672c8 and [[MN75]] at MN I 509,14. Hoffman 1987: 401 notes that the simile of the blind
man who is cheated into accepting something on faith in [[MN75]] at MN I 509,31 shows that from an
early Buddhist viewpoint “having saddhā is not always regarded as a good thing”.

411,1 list association with worthy men, hearing the Dharma, proper attention, and practice in accordance with the Dharma as the four factors that lead to stream-entry. [[SN55.56-58]] at SN V 411 present
the same four as the path to the higher stages of awakening. [[SN55.59-74]] at SN V 411-413 indicate that 若汝聖慧眼得淨者 汝便自知 ... 此是涅槃
these four factors lead to all types of wisdom, cf. also [[AN4.246]] at AN II 245,22. In contrast to this frequent occurrence of the set of all four, [[MN75]] appears to be the only instance where proper attention,
yoniso manasikāra, is not mentioned. A Sanskrit fragment of the Daśottara-sūtra, [[SN486]]V4 in Mittal
1957: 32 (cf. also the reconstruction on p. 58), also mentions 四種法 y[o]niśo manas[i]kāra�, although differing in as much as here it forms part of only three factors, the other two being frequenting worthy men
and listening to the Dharma. On 親近善知識恭敬承事, yoniso manasikāra cf. also Anālayo 2009y. 聞善法, 善思惟, 趣向法次法

far as it does not record that Māgandiya became a stream-enterer during this exposition.
The two versions agree, however, that Māgandiya requested ordination, [113] and that, after
having been ordained, he eventually became an arahant.


[[MN76]] Sandaka-sutta

The Sandaka-sutta, the “discourse to Sandaka”, presents an examination by Ānanda
of what renders going forth meaningless or fruitless. This discourse does not have a
parallel in the Chinese Āgamas. [114] A few parts of this discourse have, however, been
preserved in Sanskrit fragments. [115] Although these fragments do not suffice for a full
comparative study, two points can be made from a comparative perspective.


112 According to [[MN75]] at MN I 512,13, by undertaking practice in accordance with the Dharma, Māgandiya would come to know by himself how the cessation of clinging leads via the cessation of becoming
and birth to the cessation of dukkha.
113 While in [[MN75]] at MN I 512,26 the Buddha replied to this request by indicating that followers of a different tradition need to undergo a probation period of four months, in [[MA153]] at T I 673a21 the Buddha readily ordained Māgandiya by saying “welcome monk, practise the holy life”,
. Pāli instances of this short form of ordination, the ehi bhikkhu upasampadā, can be found, for
example, in Vin I 12,23 or at Th 625; on such early form of ordination as a combination of what later
were the two stages of going forth and higher ordination, cf. also, e.g., Bhagvat 1939: 131, Dhirasekera
1982/2007: 222, Dutt 1924/1996: 147, Gokuldas 1955: 41, Gombrich 1984b: 42, and Upasak 1975:
138. For Māgandiya to have changed his earlier attitude towards the Buddha to such an extent as to request ordination, it would fit the context for him to attain stream-entry during the delivery of the discourse, as reported in [[MA153]]
114 Akanuma 1929/1990: 167 identifies [[SA973]] at T II 251b-c and [[SA2]] 207 at T II 451a-b as parallels to
[[MN76]] These two discourses report Ānanda explaining the need to overcome lust, anger, and delusion,
followed by pointing out the noble eightfold path as the means to achieve this. Thus, these discourses 善來比丘, 修行
梵行 would rather be parallels to [[AN5.57]] at AN I 215-217. Moreover, according to [[SA973]] at T II 251b22
Ānanda’s interlocutor was a heterodox wanderer called, whom the Taishō edition p. 251 note 7
and the Sa�yukta-āgama edition p. 1463 note 5 identify to be Channa, the same person featuring
in [[AN5.57]] at AN I 215,24 as the one whose visit caused Ānanda to deliver the discourse. Possibly the
fact that [[SA973]] and SĀ [2] 207 take place at Ghosita’s park in Kosambī, the location of [[MN76]] may
have led Akanuma to consider these two discourses as parallels to [[MN76]] [[AN5.57]] differs in fact in
this respect from [[SA973]] and SĀ [2] 207, since [[AN5.57]] at AN I 215,23 has the standard reference to sāvatthi nidāna�, which may indicate the location of the discourse or else, according to a suggestion made
by Rhys Davids in Woodward 1924/1975: xi-xii, this standard reference might refer to the place where
the discourses were collected. The examination of a teacher’s claim to omniscience in [[MN76]] at MN I
519,13 has a counterpart in [[MA188]] at T I 734b18, although here the criticism of such a claim is voiced
by a heterodox recluse, instead of being spoken by Ānanda. 栴陀

“holy life without consolation”, found at MN I 520,19. The as yet unpublished fragment 149/160 of the
Hoernle collection parallels, according to Hartmann 1992: 47, the beginning part of [[MN76]] from MN I


414   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


MN I 517  The first of these two points concerns the fourth of the ways that negate living the
holy life. According to the Sandaka-sutta’s presentation, this fourth way occurs when a
teacher proposes a theory of seven immutable bodies, proclaiming that purification
comes about through a predetermined and fixed sa�sāric process. While the Sandakasutta presents this as one coherent view, in the Sāmaññaphala-sutta the same position
amounts to two different views, as this discourse attributes the theory of seven immutable bodies to Pakudha Kaccāyana, whereas the doctrine of a fixed sa�sāric process of
purification was, according to the Sāmaññaphala-sutta, a teaching propounded by Makkhali Gosāla. [116]
The Sāmaññaphala-sutta reports Makkhali Gosāla’s view to have been that the purification of beings happens without any cause. [117] Such a denial of causality would not
fit too well with the remainder of the theory attributed to him in the Sāmaññaphalasutta, since the idea of a fixed sa�sāric process of purification proposes a cause for the
purification of beings, namely repeated rebirths. [118]
The theory of this fixed sa�sāric process of purification proposes a staggering number of fixed principles, describing a set number of actions, a set number of types of
abode, a set number of elements, etc. Prominent among these classifications are analyses involving sets of sevens. A theory of a fixed process of purification based on fixed
principles and making frequent usage of the number seven would fit Pakudha Kaccāyana’s theory of seven immutable bodies well, as his theory does involve static principles
and makes much use of the number seven. It would certainly fit his theory better than
Makkhali Gosāla’s denial of causality. [119]


513,13 to MN I 514,26. A discourse quotation paralleling the view described in [[MN76]] at MN I 515,4
can be found in Abhidh-k 4:78 in Pradhan 1967: 247,20; cf. also T 1558 at T XXIX 88b14 and T 1559
at T XXIX 243b25.
116 [[DN2]] at DN I 56,20 and DN I 53,32.
117 [[DN2]] at DN I 53,25: “there is no cause or condition for the purification of beings, beings are purified
without cause or condition” n’ atthi hetu n’ atthi paccayo sattāna� visuddhiyā, ahetu apaccayā sattā
visujjhanti. A similar proposition is attributed to him in the Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1978a: 221,29,
according to which he proclaimed that nāsti hetu� nāsti pratyaya�, sattvā� vi�uddhyante, ahetvapratyaya� sattvā viśudhyante (with the decisive difference that the Sa�ghabhedavastu does not combine this
view with the proposal of the fixed sa�sāric process of purification). As already noted by Barua 1921/
1981: 304, the Jain Viyāhapa��atti (quoted with translation in Basham 1951: 219), also attributes a
theory of natural transformation to Makkhali Gosāla.
118 This difficulty had already been noted by Law 1919: 133. According to Harvey 2007: 43, however, the
two positions can be seen to harmonize, if one interprets the denial of causality to refer only to the absence of any “cause within the current control of a person”.
119 A closer examination of the presentation of Makkhali Gosāla’s view in [[DN2]] at DN I 53,29 further supports the possibility that the theory of sa�sāric purification and the denial of causality may not belong
to the same teacher. Franke 1913a: 56 note 5 notes several occurrences of -e terminations for nominative singular masculine and neuter, which are found predominantly in the later part of the statement attributed to Makkhali Gosāla, cf. also Lüders 1954: 16. Based on these occurrences, Basham 1951: 24
and Vogel 1970: 23 note 20 suggest that the view attributed to Makkhali Gosāla may be a composite of
what originally were two different passages. According to Bechert 1957: 74, however, the -e forms could


Chapter 8 Paribbājaka-vagga                                     -  415


The Sāmaññaphala-sutta stands in fact alone in its presentation, as neither its Chinese parallels nor a version of this discourse preserved in the Sa�ghabhedavastu of the
(Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya attribute the teaching of a fixed sa�sāric process of purification to Makkhali Gosāla. [120] One of the Chinese parallels to the Sāmaññaphala-sutta
even attributes the theory of a fixed sa�sāric process of purification to Pakudha Kaccāyana. [121]
Thus this Chinese discourse, as well as the Sandaka-sutta, combine the idea of a fixed
sa�sāric process of purification with the theory of seven immutable bodies and thereby
treat them as one coherent view. A combination of these two views can also be found
in the Pravrajyāvastu and the Sa�ghabhedavastu, although these texts attribute this
view to Ajita Kesakambalī. [122]
Other Pāli discourses show some inconsistencies in their presentation of Makkhali
Gosāla’s views, indicating that some degree of confusion about what view(s) should be
attributed to him may already have been present at an early stage of their transmission, [123]
a confusion that might also have affected the Sāmaññaphala-sutta. Although the Sandaka-sutta does not mention Makkhali Gosāla or any of the other six teachers by name,
its combination of the theory of seven immutable principles with a fixed sa�sāric process of purification may, after all, be a more coherent presentation.
The other point that can be made from a comparative perspective in regard to the
Sandaka-sutta concerns a teacher’s claim to omniscience. This claim occurs as the first
of the four types of holy life without consolation. Parts of the examination of the first
type of such a holy life without consolation have been preserved in one of the Sanskrit
fragments, which offers additional examples that render such a teacher’s claim to omniscience self-contradictory. The Sanskrit fragment agrees with the Sandaka-sutta in
describing how a supposedly omniscient teacher enters an empty house (presumably in
search of alms), comes across a wild animal, or has to ask for someone’s name or for
the way. In addition, the Sanskrit fragment depicts how such a teacher falls into a pond,
a sewer, or a cesspool, [124] or even bangs (his head) on a door. [125] These additional descriptions further enhance the absurd situation that can result from claiming omniscience.


be Sinhalisms. Yet, Norman 1976: 120 draws attention to a similar fluctuation between -o and -e terminations in a Jain text that also takes up views of other teachers, which obviously could not be due to
any Sinhalisms. This makes it improbable that similar fluctuations in Pāli descriptions of the views of
other teachers should be due to the influence of the Sinhalese reciters.
120 The Chinese parallels are [[DA27]] at T I 108b13, [[EA43.7]] at T II 763b17, and T 22 at T I 271c9. The relevant part from the Sa�ghabhedavastu version can be found in Gnoli 1978a: 221,27.

416   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


The agreement between the Pāli and Sanskrit presentations on the predicament
caused by such claims makes it rather improbable that such a claim had already been
attributed to the Buddha at the time when the Sandaka-sutta came into being. [126]


[[MN77]] Mahāsakuludāyi-sutta

The Mahāsakuludāyi-sutta, the “greater discourse to Sakuludāyī”, sets forth those
qualities of the Buddha that cause his disciples to respect him. This discourse has a
parallel in the Madhyama-āgama. [127]

MN II 2   The Mahāsakuludāyi-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel begin by relating that
the Buddha went to visit the wanderer Sakuludāyī. [128] During the ensuing conversation,
Sakuludāyī contrasted the disrespectful behaviour of the disciples of six other wellknown contemporary teachers with the respectful behaviour of the Buddha’s disciples.
Although the main thread of presentation in this part of the two discourses is the same,
the two versions exhibit a few minor but noteworthy differences.
Both discourses describe that just before the Buddha’s arrival, Sakuludāyī and his
assembly had been engaging in various types of pointless talk. [129] On arrival, the Bud

literally “discourse to Arrow Hair”. Minh Chau 1964/1991: 378 and the Taishō edition p. 781 note 18
indicate that corresponds to Sakuludāyī. recurs in SĀ [2] 323 at T II 481c15 to render Sūciloma
(cf. also the more fitting rendering of this name as, “Needle Hair”, in [[SA1324]] at T II 363c1).
Throughout [[MA207]] the Buddha in fact addresses as, Udāyī, which supports the Taishō
edition’s suggestion that in [[MA207]] does stand for Sakuludāyī, although the reasoning behind the
choice of this rendering by the translator(s) remains unclear to me. For remarks on [[MA207]] see Minh
Chau 1964/1991: 71-72; a translation of [[MA207]] together with extracts from the present discussion,
can be found in Anālayo 2009d. A discourse quotation paralleling the description of the abhibhāyatanas in [[MN77]] at MN II 13,16 (not necessarily specific to the present discourse) can be found in Abhidh-k 8:35 in Pradhan 1967: 457,2, cf. also T 1558 at T XXIX 151c14 and T 1559 at T XXIX 303b 箭毛經 1.
128 While according to [[MN77]] at MN II 1,8 the Buddha went to the Peacock’s Sanctuary to visit Sakuludāyī because it was yet too early to beg alms in Rājagaha, [[MA207]] at T I 781c 箭毛 箭毛 3 reports that after completing his alms round and taking his meal the Buddha took his sitting mat and approached the Pea- 針毛
cock’s Sanctuary where Sakuludāyī was staying. 箭毛 優陀夷
129 [[MN77]] at MN II 1,15 and [[MA207]] at T I 781c 箭毛 8 speak literally of “various animal talk”, anekavihita�
tiracchānakatha�, . Bodhi in Ñā�amoli 1995/2005: 1282 note 748 explains that “tiracchāna means literally ‘going horizontally’, and although this term is used as a designation for animals,
... [the commentary] explains that in the present context it means talk that goes ‘horizontally’ or ‘perpendicularly’ to the path”. Norman 1993/1994: 91 suggests that “tiracchāna kathā was at one time one
example of ... gossip, ‘talk about animals’, on the same lines as ‘talk about kings’, etc., and it then became used in a generic sense, to stand for all such talk”; on the significance of the topics listed in such
descriptions cf. also Law 1918: 402. The instances listed in the standard Pāli and Chinese descriptions

Chapter 8 Paribbājaka-vagga                                     -  417


dha politely inquired after the topic of the conversation that had been interrupted by his
arrival. According to the Majjhima-nikāya version, in reply Sakuludāyī explained that
it had been a conversation of little interest, after which he turns to what seems to be a
different topic, namely a former discussion on the behaviour of the disciples of other
teachers. [130] According to the Madhyama-āgama report, however, the Buddha had asked
up to three times to be informed about the conversation that had been going on, thereby
finally prompting Sakuludāyī to explain that he and his disciples had been reviewing a
former discussion on the behaviour of the disciples of other teachers. [131]
In both versions, this topic regarding the behaviour of the disciples of other teachers
then forms the beginning point of the ensuing discussion between Sakuludāyī and the
Buddha. Thus, whereas in the Majjhima-nikāya version the behaviour of the disciples
of other teachers constitutes a change of topic from what Sakuludāyī and his disciples
had been conversing about, in the Madhyama-āgama version it was just this subject
that they had been discussing.
Although the Madhyama-āgama presentation fits the narrative flow well, it stands in
contrast to the earlier indication, made in both discourses, that Sakuludāyī and his assembly had been engaged in various types of pointless talk. Such descriptions of pointless talk form a standard pericope in the discourses in order to depict the behaviour of
heterodox wanderers. If it were not for this description, the Madhyama-āgama version’s
presentation would present a meaningful sequence of events, where Sakuludāyī and his
disciples are engaged in discussing a topic that is interrupted by the Buddha’s arrival,
but then is taken up again on the Buddha’s repeated request. [132]
The Madhyama-āgama version also differs from the Mahāsakuludāyi-sutta as it reports that at that time the Buddha was living in the company of one-thousand-two-hundred-and-fifty monks. [133] In general, the early discourses use the number five hundred in
such circumstances. Both numbers are not to be taken too literal, as they often appear
to have a predominantly symbolic value, [134] that is, the number “five hundred” usually

of such ‘pointless talk’ are fairly similar. A noteworthy difference is that while [[MN77]] at MN II 1,19
speaks merely of “talk about women”, itthikathā (S [e] -MN II 310,17: itthīº), [[MA207]] at T I 781c9 lists
“talk about married women”, “talk about girls” and “talk about adulterous women”,
. This presentation puts the heterodox wanderers in an even more unfavourable light than in [[MN77]] “Talks with or about women”, itthīkahā, was also censured among Jain monks, cf. Balbir 2002: 72
and �hā�a�ga 4.282 in Jambūvijaya 1985: 111,15, which distinguishes between four types of talk
about women, namely their caste, their families, their beauty and their adornments; cf. also �hā�a�ga
4.284 in Jambūvijaya 1985: 113,15, which indicates that monastics do not indulge in talk about women,
and �hā�a�ga 7.569 in Jambūvijaya 1985: 234,7 for a listing of seven unbefitting types of talk.

131 [[MA207]] at T I 781c23.
132 A similar description of Sakuludāyī’s congregation of wanderers engaged in pointless talk can be found
in [[MN79]] at MN II 30,1 and its parallel [[MA208]] at T I 783c12; cf. also below p. 432 note 192. 論婦人, 論童女,
133 [[MA207]] at T I 781b 論婬女 29.
134 The number five hundred seems to derive its significance from the number five, which in turn is taken
from the number of the fingers of a hand and thus in the early discourses represents a basic unit, cf.
Rhys Davids 1937: 410, who explains that the number five is “a comprehensive unit in Indian thought

stands representative for “a great number”. [135] Such a symbolic use of numbers is one of
the characteristics of oral traditions in general, where numbers tend to be stereotyped
and to be used in a predominantly allegorical way. [136] Besides, in ancient India numbers
would have still possessed a significance on their own, beyond their function as devices for mathematical operations. [137]
A count of five hundred occurs also in the Madhyama-āgama discourse, namely as
the number of disciples of Sakuludāyī and of the six other teachers. In this way, the
numbering of the Buddha’s disciples as one-thousand-two-hundred-and-fifty stands in
a favourable contrast to the other teachers, indicating that they were not able to command a following as large as the Buddha. [138 ]
Examining descriptions of the Buddha’s disciples in other discourses brings to light
that the number one-thousand-two-hundred-and-fifty occurs only sporadically in the
Pāli Nikāyas, [139] in the Madhyama-āgama, and in the Sa�yukta-āgama. [140] A considera

... probably derived from the pañca�gulika formation of the human hand”. Multiplying five with ten times
ten (= both hands) makes ‘five hundred’ and stands for a ‘large group’. PED: 388 s.v. pañca explains
that the number five hundred has lost its “original numerical significance ... psychologically five hundred is to be explained as a ‘great hand’, i.e. the five fingers magnified to the 2 [nd] decade, and is equivalent to an expression like ‘a lot’”, a number found “especially frequent in recording a company of men,
a host of servants, animals in a herd, etc., wherever the single constituents form a larger ... whole”. The
idea of a ‘very large group’ could then be arrived at by five times five times five times ten, which results in the number ‘one-thousand-two-hundred-fifty’; cf. also Deeg 1995: 77-78 and Yuyama 1992.
135 Bareau 1971a: 80-81 takes the number five hundred to represent “many” (beaucoup), PED: 388 s.v.
pañca similarly explains five hundred to correspond to “a lot”, and Wagle 1966: 16 speaks of “a sizable
group”; cf. also Feer 1884b: 114 and Wiltshire 1990: 176.
136 Vansina 1985: 171 explains that numbers “are both abstract and repetitive so that they fare badly in all

[oral] traditions and are stereotyped to numbers meaning ‘perfect’, ‘many’, ‘few’”.
137 Syrkin 1983: 156 speaks of “an archaic and universal tendency to describe the world with the help of
definite number complexes ... manifoldly reflected in the Pali canon”.
138 [[MA207]] at T I 781c6 counts Sakuludāyī’s followers and [[MA207]] at T I 782a4+9 counts the followers of
the other six teachers as five hundred,, while according to [[MA207]] at T I 782a13 (cf. also T I
781b29) the Buddha had one-thousand-two-hundred-fifty followers, . Manné 1990: 49
comments that in discourses that have a debate character and feature a meeting with an opponent “the
description of the size of the following around each of the opponents ... serves to enhance, or otherwise,
the importance of each adversary”.
139 [[DN2]] at DN I 47,4, [[DN14]] at DN II 6,11, [[SN8.8]] at SN I 192,10 (or [[SN2]] 216 at [[SN2]] I 414,5), and [[SNP3.7]]
at Sn p. 102,20 (= [[MN92]]) depict the Buddha in the company of one-thousand-two-hundred-and-fifty
monks. The parallels to [[DN2]] [[DA27]] at T I 107a22, [[EA43.7]] at T II 762a8, and T 22 at T I 271a2, agree
with [[DN2]] on the number of monks present. The parallels to [[DN14]] agree with the Pāli account on the
number of monks, cf. Sanskrit fragment [[SN360]] folio 11(7)V4 in Fukita 2003: 4 or in Waldschmidt
1953: 15 and the Chinese parallels [[DA1]] at T I 2c 五百 1, [[EA48.4]] at T II 791a3, T 2 at T I 151c28, and T 4 at
T I 160a22. A parallel to [[SN8.8]] [[SA1219]] at T II 332b2, records only the presence of one-thousand 千二百五十
monks. A parallel to [[SNP3.7]] [[EA49.6]] at T II 798a26, reports that only five hundred monks were present.
140 [[MA207]] appears to be the only discourse in the Madhyama-āgama to portray the Buddha with a congregation of one-thousand-two-hundred-and-fifty monks, just as [[SA914]] at T II 230b4 appears to be the
only discourse in the Sa�yukta-āgama to depict him with such a large following. Nakamura 2000a:
306 suggest that this number may represent the converted disciples of the three Kassapa brothers (five


Chapter 8 Paribbājaka-vagga                                     -  419


bly more frequent use is made of this number, however, in discourses from the Ekottarika-āgama. [141] In the Dīrgha-āgama, then, the number one-thousand-two-hundred-andfifty is standard in the description of the congregation of the Buddha’s monk disciples
in the introductory narration to a discourse, only on rare occasions giving way to the
less impressive number of five hundred disciples. [142]
The comparatively high number of references to one-thousand-two-hundred-and-fifty
disciples in the Dīrgha-āgama could be related to the circumstance that this collection
appears to have been transmitted within the Dharmaguptaka tradition, which tends to
give a particular emphasis to the superior qualities of the Buddha.
The tendency to exalt the Buddha’s status as a teacher is, however, not confined to
the Dharmaguptaka tradition, in fact the Madhyama-āgama parallel to the Mahāsakuludāyi-sutta carries its numerological conceptions even further. When relating the Buddha’s delivery of teachings on a former occasion, according to the Madhyama-āgama
version his audience amounted to “innumerable hundred-thousands”, [143] whereas the
Majjhima-nikāya version only records the comparatively less impressive presence of
“several hundreds” of listeners during this teaching. [144]
The Madhyama-āgama discourse’s tendency to exalt the Buddha can also be seen in
its description of how Sakuludāyī rose up on seeing the Buddha come, arranged his robe
over one shoulder and greeted the Buddha with palms together, a behaviour not recorded
in the Majjhima-nikāya version. [145] Since, according to both discourses, Sakuludāyī was
a famous teacher, [146] such outward display of humility and respect in the presence of his
own disciples, when being visited by another teacher, seems a little out of proportion.


hundred + three hundred + two hundred, cf. Vin I 24,13) and the converted disciples of Sañjaya (twohundred-and-fifty, cf. Vin I 39,24), which together would amount to a following of one-thousand-twohundred-and-fifty monks.
141 The presence of one-thousand-two-hundred-and-fifty disciples or listeners is recorded in [[EA26.9]] at T
II 639a15, [[EA30.3]] at T II 660a2, [[EA36.5]] at T II 708a26, [[EA43.7]] at T II 762a8, [[EA45.7]] at T II 773c21,

142 Nearly all of the thirty discourses found in the Dīrgha-āgama report the Buddha to be in the presence
of one-thousand-two-hundred-and-fifty disciples, cf. [[DA1]] at T I 1b13, [[DA2]] at T I 11a9, [[DA3]] at T I

420   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


The same Madhyama-āgama version, however, reports that Sakuludāyī addressed the
Buddha by his name Gotama, a not particularly respectful way of behaviour. [147] According to the Majjhima-nikāya version, however, Sakuludāyī rather used the respectful address “Blessed One” and “venerable sir”. [148] In this respect, then, the Madhyama-āgama
presentation would correspond more closely to the way other discourses depict the common usage among wanderers.
The respectful address “venerable sir”, in contrast, is in the discourses usually employed by disciples towards their teacher, or by laity when speaking with monks and
wanderers, while the address “Blessed One” seems to be used mainly by followers of
the Buddha. Although Sakuludāyī may have felt respect and sympathy for the Buddha,
it strikes an unusual note for a teacher and leader of a congregation of non-Buddhist
wanderers like Sakuludāyī to be depicted as adopting the behaviour of a faithful Buddhist disciple. [149]
That the Majjhima-nikāya version might have suffered from some confusion in regard to modes of address becomes evident at a later point, when both versions take up
the respect the Buddha’s disciples had for their teacher. While in the Madhyama-āgama account the Buddha describes how his disciples would refer to him as “our Blessed
One”, in the corresponding Majjhima-nikāya passage he indicates that his disciples
would use the expression “recluse Gotama” to refer to him, an expression that in other
discourses is regularly employed by outsiders that do not consider themselves disciples
of the Buddha. [150] Hence, according to the Mahāsakuludāyi-sutta Sakuludāyī used what
the disciples should have used, while the disciples used the address to be expected of
Sakuludāyī. This presentation may be the outcome of a mix up during the process of
transmission.

MN II 3  The two versions agree that none of the six teachers was able to silence his disciples in
order to be able to reply to a question asked by his visitors. The Majjhima-nikāya discourse describes that these disciples even openly proclaimed that their teacher did not
know how to reply, telling the visitors that it would be better to ask them instead of
asking their teacher. [151] This presents the followers of the other six teachers in a more
unfavourable light than the Madhyama-āgama version. If the disciples of the six teachers had indeed been as disrespectful as reported in the Mahāsakuludāyi-sutta, it would
be difficult to conceive of these teachers being held in as high an esteem by their contemporaries as reported in both versions of the present discourse.

In relation to the behaviour of the disciples of the Buddha, the Mahāsakuludāyi-sutta MN II 4
and its Madhyama-āgama parallel relate an instance when a disciple made some noise
while the Buddha was giving a talk. Whereas according to the Majjhima-nikāya account
the disciple had merely cleared his throat, according to its Madhyama-āgama parallel
he had actually fallen asleep and was snoring, a not too flattering description of what
can happen when the Buddha delivers a talk. [152]
The Majjhima-nikāya version, moreover, reports that, whenever the Buddha taught,
the assembled audience was totally intent on what he said. [153] The Mahāsakuludāyi-sutta also notes that even those who give up the life of a Buddhist monk and return to lay
life will nevertheless praise the Buddha and his teaching. The Madhyama-āgama discourse does not report the attentive behaviour of the assembly, nor does it take up the
issue of monks disrobing. In fact, its description of a monk who falls asleep and is snoring
would not fit the Mahāsakuludāyi-sutta’s account of the attentive behaviour of the Buddha’s audience.
Looking back on these variations between the Mahāsakuludāyi-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel, it seems that both versions are under the influence of the same
tendency to enhance the status and position of the Buddha, although this tendency
manifests in different ways in each of the two versions.
The Mahāsakuludāyi-sutta and its parallel continue by reporting five reasons that Sa- MN II 5
kuludāyī thought to be responsible for the respect shown by the Buddha’s disciples to
their teacher. Although differing in the sequence (see table 8.4), the two versions agree
on these five reasons being the taking of little food, contentment with any robe, any
alms food, and any dwelling place, and a secluded life-style.
In reply to this proposition, according to both versions the Buddha pointed out that
some of his disciples surpassed him in regard to each of these qualities, so that these
five reasons would not suffice for instilling respect in his disciples. [154] Instead, he explained, his disciples respected him for five other qualities.

152 [[MN77]] at MN II 4,35: ukkāsi, [[MA207]] at T I 782b18: . The description of a disciple who is
admonished for clearing his throat recurs in [[MN89]] at MN II 122,10, where the parallel [[MA213]] at T I
797a18 again suggests that the disciple was actually snoring, while a parallel to the same discourse in
the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, T 1451 at T XXIV 238a26, agrees with the Pāli version that he merely
cleared his throat; cf. below p. 515 note 348. Another such case appears to be found in T 212 at T IV
700b18. According to a description of the conduct of ancient Indian śrama�as by Megasthenes, during
the delivery of a discourse “the hearer is not allowed to speak or even to cough, and much less to spit,
and if he offends in any of these ways he is cast out ... as being a man who is wanting in self-restraint”,
cf. McCrindle 1877: 99. According to [[EA38.5]] at T II 718c19, on another occasion Anuruddha fell asleep
while the Buddha was giving a teaching to a vast assembly, and according to [[EA30.2]] at T II 659c2 on
yet another occasion an elderly monk even stretched out his 鼾眠作聲 feet towards the Buddha and took a nap while
the Buddha was giving a talk to a vast assembly.
153 [[MN77]] at MN II 5,5. This depiction of an invariably attentive assembly would stand in contrast to [[MN65]] at MN I 445,31 and its parallel [[MA194]] at T I 749b3, according to which a monk met with rebuke
for not paying attention when the Buddha taught the Dharma.
154 [[MA207]] at T I 783a4 contrasts the Buddha’s partaking of a single or even half a beluva fruit with his
disciples who take a single or half a cup full of food. Since the point of the whole exposition in both ver

MN II 9  With some differences in sequence (see table 8.5 below), the Mahāsakuludāyi-sutta
and its parallel agree that the first four of these five qualities are:

         - higher virtue,

         - knowledge-and-vision,

         - higher wisdom,

         - teaching the four noble truths. [155]
In regard to the Buddha’s higher virtue, while the Majjhima-nikāya version does not
offer further information on this quality, the Madhyama-āgama discourse explains that
the Buddha’s higher virtue was such that he spoke as he acted and acted as he spoke. [156]
This specification sets a meaningful contrast to the type of more external virtuous conduct envisaged as praiseworthy by Sakuludāyī.

MN II 10 In regard to higher wisdom, the Majjhima-nikāya account points out that it was due to
the confidence of his disciples in his wisdom that they would not interrupt the Buddha
when he was teaching.
The Majjhima-nikāya presentation continues by noting that the Buddha did not expect teachings from his disciples, but they expected teachings from him. [157] These specifications, which are not found in the Madhyama-āgama parallel, explain why the Bud

sions is to show that some of the disciples surpassed the Buddha in regard to each of the five qualities,
this part of [[MA207]] appears to have suffered from a confusion during its transmission or translation. In
the corresponding passage in [[MN77]] at MN II 6,34, the beluva fruit and the cup full of food are both
part of the depiction of the small amounts taken by disciples, in contrast to which the Buddha is said to
sometimes take a whole bowl full of food, or even more.
155 [[MA207]] at T I 783b2+5 has these qualities in a slightly different order, as it first takes up “unsurpassable wisdom”,, and then “unsurpassable knowledge and vision”,, whereas in [[MN77]] at MN II 9,22 “knowledge-and-vision”, ñā�adassana, precedes “higher wisdom”, adhipaññā.

dha’s disciples would display a type of behaviour different from the behaviour of the
disciples of the other teachers.


Table 8.5: Five Inner Qualities of the Buddha in [[MN77]] and its Parallel

|[[MN77]]|[[MA207]]|
|---|---|
|higher virtue (1)<br>knowledge and vision (2)<br>higher wisdom (3)<br>teaching of four noble truths (4)<br>teaching ways of development (5)|supreme virtue (→ 1)<br>supreme wisdom (→ 3)<br>supreme knowledge and vision (→ 2)<br>teaching of four noble truths (→ 4)<br>teaching higher knowledge (→ 5)|



In regard to the fifth inner quality of the Buddha, the Madhyama-āgama presentation
takes up his teaching of the recollection of past lives and of the eradication of the influxes. The Madhyama-āgama version concludes that his disciples had confidence in
the Buddha because through these teachings they were able to go beyond doubt and
reach the other shore. [158]
The Majjhima-nikāya version differs considerably, as it instead presents a detailed
exposition of various aspects of the Buddhist path that covers the following topics:

  - the four satipa��hānas,

  - the four right efforts,

  - the four ways to [psychic] power (iddhipāda),

  - the five faculties,

  - the five powers,

  - the seven awakening factors,

  - the noble eightfold path,

  - the eight liberations (vimokkha),

  - the eight bases for transcendence (abhibhāyatana),

  - the ten kasi�as,

  - the four jhānas,

  - insight into the nature of body and consciousness, [159]

  - production of a mind-made body (manomaya kāya),

  - supernormal powers (iddhi),

  - the divine ear,

  - telepathic knowledge of the minds of others,

  - recollection of past lives,


158 [[MA207]] at T I 783b16. [[MA207]] precedes this description by referring to the Buddha’s ability to teach
the four noble truths, found in similar terms in [[MN77]] at MN II 10,20. An extract from the present
discussion already appeared in Anālayo 2005c: 95-96.
159 A parallel to the simile of the reed, used to illustrate this particular insight, can be found in the Ka�ha
Upani�ad 2.3.17. Another parallel occurs in the Jain Sūyaga�[[AN2.1]].16 in Bollée 1977b: 25,23, translated
ibid. p. 140, preceded by the simile of drawing a sword from its scabbard; cf. also the Śatapatha Brāhma�[[AN4.3]].3.16 on which cf. Chaudhary 1994e: 161 and Norman 1976/1991: 101-102.

      - the divine eye,

      - the destruction of the influxes. [160]
When considering this exposition in the light of its Madhyama-āgama parallel, the
Buddha’s ability to teach the path to the eradication of the influxes would suffice in order to explain what really makes him worthy of respect. The long exposition given in
the Mahāsakuludāyi-sutta appears somewhat out of proportion, as after announcing an
exposition of five qualities it takes up the first four qualities only in brief but then delivers a disproportionally long exposition of the fifth quality. Due to this detailed exposition, the Mahāsakuludāyi-sutta has become a rather long discourse that would perhaps find a more fitting placement in the Dīgha-nikāya, instead of being included
among discourses of “middle length”. In sum, this whole exposition in the Mahāsakuludāyi-sutta gives the impression of being an expansion of what originally would have
only been a reference to the destruction of the influxes or to the three higher knowledges.

MN II 22  While the Majjhima-nikāya version ends with Sakuludāyī’s delight in the Buddha’s
exposition, according to the Madhyama-āgama account Sakuludāyī took refuge and
asked to be accepted as a lay follower. [161] For him to become a lay follower would, however, seem a rather unexpected course of action. Had Sakuludāyī really been ready to
formally become a disciple of the Buddha, it would have been more appropriate for
him to request ordination as a Buddhist monk. This ending in the Madhyama-āgama
version may thus be another instance of the tendency to exalt the Buddha by depicting
the effect his teaching had on his listeners, a tendency which in its various manifestations can be seen to be at work in both versions of the present discourse.


[[MN78]] Sama�ama��ikā-sutta [162]
The Sama�ama��ikā-sutta, the “discourse to Sama�ama��ika[putta]”, defines what
makes one a “supreme recluse”. This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama. [163]


160 [[MN77]] at MN II 11,3 to MN II 22,15. Eimer 1976: 53 notes that the first part of this listing, up to the
ten kasi�as, follows a numerical ascending order, while the items listed after the ten kasi�as no longer
follow this order, but instead come in the same sequence as found in [[DN2]] at DN I 73,23 to DN I 84,12.
This suggests that two originally independent listings have been combined in the present instance.
161 [[MA207]] at T I 783b28: “may the Blessed One accept me as a lay follower from now on”,
. Notably, at this point Sakuludāyī switches from the address “ascetic Gotama”
to the address “Blessed One”, as demanded by the situation.
162 Be-MN II 214,9 and Se-MN II 342,1 have the title Sama�amu��ika-sutta.
163 The parallel is [[MA179]] at T I 720a-721c. [[MA179]] has the title “discourse to the carpenter Pañcaka�ga”,, and agrees with [[MN78]] on locating the discourse in Jeta’s Grove by Sāvatthī. A
translation of [[MA179]] together with extracts from the present discussion, can be found in Anālayo
2009h. The Vyākhyāyukti in Lee 2001: 14,12 refers to the present discourse as yan lag lnga pa’i phya
(Lee reads phywa) mkhan gyi mdo, which Skilling 2000b: 342 indicates to correspond to Pañcā�gasthapati-sūtra. For counterparts to [[MN78]] at MN II 26,16-22 and MN II 27,5-10 in Vyākhyāyukti literature cf. Skilling 2000b: 342. 唯願世尊受

The Sama�ama��ikā-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel begin by relating that MN II 24
the carpenter Pañcaka�ga visited the wanderer Sama�ama��ikaputta, [164] who proposed
that to be a supreme recluse requires not doing evil by way of body, speech, thought,
and livelihood. The two versions differ in the sequence in which they present these four
qualities (see table 8.6). Both report that Pañcaka�ga left and reported this view to the
Buddha who disapproved, explaining that a small infant would also fulfil these requirements. [165]


Table 8.6: Qualities of a Supreme Recluse in [[MN78]] and its Parallel [166]



|[[MN78]]|[[MA179]]|
|---|---|
|no evil bodily deed (1)<br>no evil verbal deed (2)<br>no evil thought (3)<br>no evil livelihood (4)|no evil bodily deed (→ 1)<br>no evil verbal deed (→ 2)<br>no evil livelihood (→ 4)<br>no evil thought (→ 3)|


The Sama�ama��ikā-sutta continues by proclaiming that a person should not be considered accomplished in what is wholesome, or a supreme recluse, simply because of
not doing evil by way of body, speech, thought, and livelihood. [167] The Madhyama-āgama version introduces a finer distinction at this point. In agreement with the Majjhimanikāya version, the Madhyama-āgama discourse proclaims that merely avoiding evil
by way of body, speech, thought, and livelihood does not suffice for being a supreme recluse, followed by pointing out, however, that to avoid evil in this way is nevertheless
an accomplishment in what is wholesome. [168] In this way, the Madhyama-āgama ver
164 The Pāli editions differ in their description of the company of the wanderer Sama�ama��ikā, which according to E [e] -MN II 23,1 numbered three hundred, while B [e] -MN II 214,14 and S [e] -MN II 342,6 give the
more usual number five hundred (thereby agreeing with [[MA179]] at T I 720b10), and C [e] -MN II 366,5
speaks of seven hundred.
165 In relation to the image of the small infant, [[MN78]] at MN II 24,33 and MN II 25,1 presents the moaning
of the infant as an example of its intention and the milk of the child’s mother as its livelihood. In this
way, [[MN78]] highlights that the intention of the child manifests through sulking and its livelihood is to
depend on the mother’s milk. [[MA179]] at T I 720c9+10 instead relates the infant’s moaning to its livelihood and the mother’s milk to the thoughts or intentions of the child,, for which Hirakawa 1997:
469 lists sa�kalpa as one of its possible equivalents, besides sm�ti, smara�a, anusm�ti, manasikāra,
etc. ([[MN78]] at MN II 24,32 speaks in this context of sa�kappa, “intention”). Thus [[MA179]] indicates
that the child’s thoughts or intentions revolve around the mother’s milk and its demand for such livelihood takes place through moaning.
166 The qualities are listed in [[MN78]] at MN II 24,7 and in [[MA179]] at T I 720b25, which thereby presents
thought, the subtlest of the four, as its last.
167 [[MN78]] at MN II 25,14: “[he is] not accomplished in what is wholesome, not perfected in what is wholesome, not an invincible recluse attained to the supreme”, na c’ eva sampannakusala� na paramakusala� na uttamapattipatta� sama�a� ayojjha� (S [e] -MN II 345,13: uttamappattipatta�).
168 [[MA179]] at T I 720c13: “he is accomplished in wholesomeness, is supreme in wholesomeness, yet is not 念
an unsurpassable person, has not reached the supreme essence, and has not the nature of a forthright recluse”, .

MN II 25


426   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


sion gives proper place to the importance of avoiding evil action, whereas the same is
somewhat lost out of sight with the Majjhima-nikāya version’s sweeping dismissal. [169]
The Sama�ama��ikā-sutta continues with a brief reference to the ten qualities required for being a supreme recluse, a reference found only in the concluding section of
its Madhyama-āgama parallel. [170] In relation to this difference, it is worthy of note that
in the early discourses it is a standard procedure to follow such a brief statement with a
detailed exposition, usually by way of a rhetorical question about the nature of what
has been said in brief. The two versions of the present discourse do indeed have such a
corresponding question together with a more detailed exposition, yet this is found in
both versions in their concluding sections. [171]
In the Madhyama-āgama discourse, this statement, the subsequent question, and the
more detailed exposition come together, follow each other naturally, and fit the context.
In contrast, in the Majjhima-nikāya version the initial statement on the ten qualities
hangs somewhat in the air, as it is followed by a different exposition that takes up the
need to understand unwholesome conduct. The transition between these two is rather
abrupt and the ensuing exposition of unwholesome conduct does not stand in a direct
relation to the ten qualities. As the question corresponding to the brief statement and
the detailed exposition of the same ten qualities occur only much later, at the end of a
treatment of the path to the cessation of wholesome intentions, it seems as if during the
process of transmission the natural connection between the initial brief statement on
the ten qualities and the subsequent question and detailed exposition was lost and the
initial statement ended up in an earlier part of the Majjhima-nikāya discourse.
In order to provide a contrast to the assumption that not doing evil suffices to become
a supreme recluse, the Sama�ama��ikā-sutta and its parallel highlight the need to properly understand the nature, the origin, the cessation, and the path leading to the cessation of:

  - unwholesome conduct,

  - wholesome conduct,

  - unwholesome intentions,

  - wholesome intentions.
The exposition of the nature and origin of conduct that is either unwholesome or else
wholesome is similar in the two versions.

169 Cf., e.g., [[AN4.116]] at AN II 119,30, a whole discourse dedicated to the importance of developing wholesome bodily, verbal, and mental conduct, together with right view. This discourse supports the presentation in [[MA179]] in the sense that proper bodily, verbal, and mental conduct can indeed be reckoned
an accomplishment in what is wholesome.
170 [[MN78]] at MN II 25,18: “endowed with ten qualities do I describe a man as ... a supreme recluse”, dasahi ... dhammehi samannāgata� purisapuggala� paññāpemi ... sama�am ayojjha� (B [e] -MN II 216,27:
paññapemi). The corresponding reference to being endowed with ten qualities occurs in [[MA179]] at T I
721c12.
171 [[MN78]] at MN II 28,34: “endowed with what ten qualities do I describe a man as ... a supreme recluse”,
katamehi ... dasahi dhammehi samannāgata� purisapuggalla� paññāpemi ... sama�am ayojjha� (B [e]  MN II 220,16: paññapemi)? The corresponding question occurs in [[MA179]] at T I 721c14.


Chapter 8 Paribbājaka-vagga                                     -  427


Regarding the cessation of unwholesome conduct, the two versions agree on men- MN II 26
tioning the need to abandon not only unwholesome bodily and verbal conduct, but also
to abandon any unwholesome mental activity. [172] This is surprising, as both versions
later on examine unwholesome and wholesome intentions on their own, whereas the
present context is concerned with forms of conduct.
The triad of bodily, verbal, and mental action occurs frequently in other discourses,
so that a passage that mentions only bodily and verbal action could easily have led a reciter to supplement the ‘missing’ mental counterpart. Thus, the reference to mental activity in the Pāli and Chinese versions’ exposition of the cessation of unwholesome
conduct could be a reciter’s error that happened early enough to make its way into the
Majjhima-nikāya and the Madhyama-āgama versions of the present discourse. [173]
The Sama�ama��ikā-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel continue by explaining
that the complementary cessation of wholesome conduct requires avoiding attachment
to such wholesome conduct. [174] To this the Majjhima-nikāya version adds the need to
understand liberation of the mind and liberation through wisdom, where wholesome
conduct ceases completely, a statement not found in its Madhyama-āgama parallel. [175]
The commentary explains that the cessation of wholesome conduct comes about with
full awakening. [176] The formulation in the Pāli discourse itself, however, does not necessarily entail full awakening, since it speaks only of “knowing” these two liberations,
not of having “realized” them. While references to “realizing” liberation of the mind
and liberation through wisdom in other discourses do indeed stand for full awakening, [177]


172 [[MN78]] at MN II 26,20: manoduccarita� pahāya manosucarita� bhāveti and [[MA179]] at T I 721a8:
.
173 A similar case can be found in [[MN39]] at MN I 272,20 and its parallel [[MA182]] at T I 725a12. These two
discourses agree on mentioning pure mental conduct after pure bodily and verbal conduct, before turning to pure livelihood, restraint of the senses, clear comprehension of bodily activities, removing the
hindrances, and developing the four jhānas. In this case, too, the reference to mental conduct seems out
of order and reduplicates the later detailed treatment of development of the mind, cf. Bucknell 1984:
16-20.
174 [[MN78]] at MN II 27,12: sīlavā hoti, no ca sīlamayo, which Chalmers 1927: 15 renders as “[he] embodies
virtue and not merely virtuous observances”, Horner 1957/1970: 226 as “[he] is of moral habit and has
no addition to make to moral habit”, and Ñā�amoli 1995/2005: 651 as “[he] is virtuous, but he does not
捨 identify with his virtue ... 意不善業, 修 ... 意善業 ”. [[MA179]] at T I 721a17: “he practises morality without being attached to morality”, .
175 [[MN78]] at MN II 27,12: tañ ca cetovimutti� paññāvimutti� yathābhūta� pajānāti, yatth’ assa te kusalasīlā aparisesā nirujjhanti (B [e] -MN II 218,26 and S [e] -MN II 248,15: kusalā sīlā).
176 Ps III 270,6. Bodhi in Ñā�amoli 1995/2005: 1286 note 775 explains that since an arahant’s “virtuous
habits no longer generate kamma, they are not describable as ‘wholesome’”.
177 References to realizing these two liberations that invariably stand for full awakening speak of “having
oneself and with direct knowledge realized here and now liberation of the mind and liberation through
wisdom”, cetovimutti� paññāvimutti� di��he va dhamme saya� abhiññā (va) sacchikatvā, cf., e.g., in
the first volume of the Majjhima-nikāya the occurrences [[MN9]] at MN I 35,36, [[MN12]] at MN I 71,10,
[[MN40]] at MN I 284,21, [[MN41]] at MN I 289,31, [[MN42]] at MN I 291,26, [[MN53]] at MN I 357,35, [[MN54]]
at MN I 367, 行戒不著戒 19, [[MN71]] at MN I 482,34, and [[MN73]] at MN I 490,14.


428   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


occurrences that speak only of “knowing” them can also refer to a stage of development that falls short of full awakening. [178]
The Sama�ama��ikā-sutta and its parallel differ on the path to the cessation of unwholesome conduct, a difference that similarly obtains in relation to the path to the
cessation of wholesome conduct. According to the Majjhima-nikāya account, this path
can be found in the four right efforts, while according to its Madhyama-āgama parallel
the same path requires the practice of the four satipa��hānas. [179]

MN II 27  With their examination of conduct completed, the two versions turn to thoughts or intentions, whose arising they attribute to perception. According to both versions, unwholesome thoughts or intentions cease with the first jhāna. In relation to the cessation
of wholesome thoughts or intentions, the Majjhima-nikāya account attributes such cessation to the second jhāna, whereas its Madhyama-āgama parallel speaks of the fourth
jhāna instead. [180]

MN II 28  The two versions also disagree on the path to the cessation of wholesome and unwholesome thoughts or intentions, where the Majjhima-nikāya discourse again speaks of the
four right efforts, just as the Madhyama-āgama version again brings up the four satipa��hānas. [181]


178 In [[MN38]] at MN I 270,11, [[SN35.202]] at SN IV 186,16, and [[AN5.142]] at AN III 166,8, the expression
“he understands in accordance with reality liberation of the mind and liberation through wisdom”, cetovimutti� paññāvimutti� yathābhūta� pajānāti, seems to stand for full awakening, as [[MN38]] at MN I
270,13 indicates that someone endowed with such understanding does not delight in feelings and has
eradicated dukkha, [[SN35.202]] at SN IV 187,22 similarly notes that someone with this understanding
has overcome those states that lead to re-becoming and dukkha, and according to [[AN5.142]] at AN III
167,14 someone who has such understanding ranges as the fifth in an examination of five different
types of person, of which only the other four are still in need of eradicating the influxes. Occurrences of
the same expression in [[SN35.203]] at SN IV 189,33 and [[AN10.75]] at AN V 139,26, however, clearly do
not refer to full awakening, since [[SN35.203]] at SN IV 190,9 envisages the arising of evil and unwholesome states, pāpakā akusalā dhammā, for someone who has understood in accordance with reality the
liberation of the mind and liberation through wisdom, while in [[AN10.75]] at AN V 139,24 a person endowed with the same understanding can even be of “bad morality”, dussīla. [[SN35.132]] at SN IV 120,21
and [[SN35.206]] at SN IV 199,24 mention such knowledge in relation to sense-restraint, a usage which
would also not refer only to arahants.
179 [[MN78]] at MN II 26,24 and [[MA179]] at T I 721a10. In relation to this difference, although mindfulness
plays an important role in matters of conduct, the four right efforts would be more appropriate to the
present context, since to avoid and overcome unwholesomeness and to develop and establish what is
wholesome has a direct bearing on matters of conduct; cf. also Gethin 1992a: 78.
180 [[MN78]] at MN II 28,22 and [[MA179]] at T I 721b17. In relation to this difference, it is noteworthy that the
standard description of the jhānas in the Pāli and Chinese discourses presents the removal of initial and
sustained mental application as the decisive precondition for entering the second jhāna. Thus, although
wholesome thoughts and intentions will certainly have ceased with the fourth jhāna, the same already
takes place as soon as the second jhāna has been attained, so that the presentation in [[MN78]] appears to
be more to the point.
181 In relation to the path leading to the cessation of unwholesome types of thought or intention, depicted
in [[MN78]] at MN II 28,4 and [[MA179]] at T I 721b4, it is noteworthy that satipa��hāna can lead to a change
in perception, which according to [[MN78]] and [[MA179]] is the source for the arising of such thoughts or


Chapter 8 Paribbājaka-vagga                                     -  429


The Sama�ama��ikā-sutta at this point proclaims that someone endowed with the MN II 29
ten path factors of an arahant is a supreme recluse. This is the later part of the passage
already discussed above, where the brief introductory reference to the ten qualities required for being a supreme recluse may have been shifted to an earlier part of the discourse during the course of transmission.
The Madhyama-āgama version differs not only by having the introductory statement
in what appears to be its proper place, but also in so far as it leads up to this exposition
with some intermediate steps, thereby giving a more detailed account of what takes
place at this point.
Before taking up the ten path factors of an arahant, the Madhyama-āgama version
describes how a noble disciple develops the factors of the noble eightfold path, a development that takes place based on knowing conduct and thoughts in their wholesome
and unwholesome manifestations and based on insight into their arising and cessation.
The Madhyama-āgama discourse presents these factors in a conditional sequence, depicting how based on right view right intention arises, based on right intention right
speech, etc. [182]
Endowed with the right concentration that has been developed based on establishing
the other factors of the eightfold noble path, a noble disciple then reaches liberation
from desire, anger, and delusion. Through such liberation, the noble disciple becomes


intentions. Thus, e.g., [[SN52.1]] at SN V 295,11 and its parallel [[SA536]] at T II 139c3 present the ability
to have control over the evaluative function of one’s perception (appatikūle pa�ikkulasaññī, etc.) as an
outcome of satipa��hāna practice. However, the second of the four right efforts appears to be more directly concerned with the cessation of unwholesome thoughts or intentions, cf., e.g., [[SN49.1]] at SN V
244,8: “he strives ... for the abandoning of arisen evil and unwholesome states”, uppannāna� pāpakāna� akusalāna� dhammāna� pahānāya ... padahati, similarly described in [[SA877]] at T II 221a24:
(where, however, this forms the first of the four right efforts). Again, [[MN117]] at MN III 73,20 and its parallels [[MA189]] at T I 736a4 and D (4094) mngon pa,
nyu 45a2 or Q (5595) thu 84b4 (which due to a textual error actually speaks of overcoming wrong
view) indicate that while mindfulness plays an important role in relation to the overcoming of wrong
intentions, their actual removal is a task performed by right effort. In relation to the complementary
path to the cessation of wholesome thoughts or intentions, depicted in [[MN78]] at MN II 28,25 and [[MA179]] at T I 721b19, it would seem that satipa��hāna constitutes indeed an important foundation for jhāna
attainment. In fact, according to [[SN52.11-24]] at SN V 303-306 and their parallel [[SA539]] at T II 140b4,
Anuruddha attributed his concentrative proficiency to his practice of the four satipa��hānas. Moreover,
[[SN47.8]] at SN V 151,28 and its parallel [[SA616]] at T II 172c18 present satipa��hāna as the tool to over已起惡不善法斷, come mental obstructions 生欲, 方便, in order 精勤, to attain 心攝受 deeper stages of concentration. [[AN7.19]] at AN II 17,2, however, relates the development of concentration to the fourth right effort in particular, indicating that to

C [e] -AN II 32,6: anurakkha�appadhāna S [e] -AN II 20,14: anurakkhanāppadhāna), “effort at protecting”,
an expression that [[AN4.69]] at AN II 74,17 defines with the standard formulation used for the fourth
right effort ([[AN7.19]] speaks in this context of the samādhinimitta arisen through perception of a skeleton or a decaying corpse, whose potential to lead to jhāna Vism 186-190 describes in detail); cf. also
[[SA879]] at T II 221b26. Hence in relation to the cessation of wholesome thoughts or intentions, it seems
that a case could be made for right effort just as well as for satipa��hāna.

an arahant endowed with the ten path factors of one beyond training. [183] The Madhyamaāgama version concludes that one endowed with these ten path factors has reached the
highest and become a supreme recluse.
The presentation in the Madhyama-āgama version thus offers a more gradual transition from the topic of conduct and thoughts to the attainment of full liberation. Such a
more detailed examination of the path to liberation accords well with the main thrust of
the discourse, which took its occasion from the mistaken belief that to become a supreme
recluse requires merely wholesome conduct and intentions.
With the Pāli commentary, however, this perspective gets lost, as the commentators
interpret the exposition of conduct and intentions from the point of view of the supramundane paths. Thus according to their explanation, the cessation of unwholesome
conduct takes place with stream-entry, while the cessation of wholesome conduct ocurs
with full awakening. [184] Similarly, the cessation of unwholesome intentions takes place
with non-return, while the cessation of wholesome intentions comes with the attainment of full awakening.
This commentarial explanation seems to rest on a too literal interpretation of the expression “cease without remainder”. [185] A perusal of other instances of the same expression in the discourses indicates that to “cease without remainder” does not always
stand for the type of final eradication that is achieved through the different stages of
realization. The same expression occurs, for example, when describing how certain
types of perception “cease without remainder” by attaining the sphere of nothingness,
or how unwholesome thoughts “cease without remainder” when one is well established
in mindfulness. [186]
Although perceptions and thoughts have indeed ceased without remainder while being
in the attainment of the sphere of nothingness or while maintaining mindfulness, later
on perceptions and thoughts will arise again. The same sense may well be relevant for
the use of the expression to “cease without remainder” in the present discourse.
In fact, a closer inspection of the Sama�ama��ikā-sutta suggests the commentarial
explanation to be unconvincing. According to the exposition given in the discourse itself, the cessation of unwholesome intentions takes place with the first jhāna, and the
cessation of wholesome intentions with the second jhāna.
If the cessation of unwholesome and wholesome intentions were indeed a matter of
non-return and arahant-ship, as stated by the commentary, then the first and second jhāna
mentioned in the discourse would be completely irrelevant as far as the cessation of in

183 [[MA179]] at T I 721c15 differs from [[MN78]] at MN II 29,9 in regard to the sequence of the final two factors, as it precedes right knowledge with right liberation. This presentation reflects the description of
the noble disciple’s attainment of liberation in [[MA179]] at T I 721c8, followed by his knowledge of being liberated in [[MA179]] at T I 721c10. For an examination of this difference in sequence, which recurs
between other Majjhima-nikāya and Madhyama-āgama discourses, cf. below p. 663.

tentions is concerned. [187] In this way, the commentarial explanation renders the stipulations given in the discourse superfluous.
In the case of the exposition of unwholesome and wholesome conduct, the cessation
of unwholesome conduct may similarly be only a matter of refraining from misconduct,
not necessarily requiring the attainment of stream-entry. In fact a stream-enterer, although being incapable of major evils, may still commit minor breaches of conduct. [188]
Hence the commentarial suggestion that with stream-entry all unwholesome conduct
ceases without remainder would not be fully to the point.
Along the same lines, the cessation of wholesome conduct might also be just a matter
of avoiding attachment to wholesome behaviour, something possible even before becoming an arahant. From this perspective, the Sama�ama��ikā-sutta’s reference to
knowing liberation of the mind and liberation through wisdom in the context of its exposition of the cessation of wholesome conduct need not have full awakening in mind,
but only a stage of development that leads up to the same.


[[MN79]] Cū�asakuludāyi-sutta

The Cū�asakuludāyi-sutta, the “lesser discourse to Sakuludāyī”, examines the way to
an entirely happy world. This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama. [189]
The Cū�asakuludāyi-sutta and its parallel begin by relating that the Buddha had come
to visit the wanderer Sakuludāyī. [190] According to the Majjhima-nikāya account, Sakuludāyī declared that, although his congregation of wanderers engaged in pointless talk
when left to themselves, if he was present they were all keen to listen to him, but once
the Buddha was also present, the wanderers and Sakuludāyī were all keen to listen to
the Buddha. [191] The Madhyama-āgama version does not record such a remark by Saku

187 Brahmāli 2007: 82.
188 Although a stream-enterer would be unable to commit a breach of the five precepts, cf., e.g., [[SN12.41]]
at SN II 68,18, [[SN12.1]] at [[SNP232]] indicates, in evident reference to a stream-enterer, that “whatever evil
deed he may do, by body, speech, or mind, he is unable to cover it up”, kiñcāpi so kamma� karoti pāpaka�, kāyena vācā uda cetasā vā, abhabbo so tassa pa�icchadāya (B [e] -[[SNP314.5]]+7: kamma and abhabba, C [e] -[[SNP370.3]] vācāyuda). This statement would be meaningless if with stream-entry minor instances
of unwholesome conduct had become a total impossibility. Similarly, [[MN48]] at MN I 324,9 describes a
stream-enterer, here referred to as the di��hisampanno puggalo, who commits an offence of the type that
allows rehabilitation, āpatti� āpajjati yathārūpāya āpattiyā vu��hāna� paññāyati (C [e] -MN I 760,13: u��hāna�). Thus [[MN48]] agrees with [[SN12.1]] that stream-enterers are capable of such deeds. [[AN3.87]] at AN
I 234,19 in a similar vein envisages the possibility that noble disciples may commit minor breaches of
the training rules.
189 The parallel is [[MA208]] at T I 783c-786b, which agrees with [[MN79]] on locating the discourse in the
Squirrels’ Feeding Ground at Rājagaha. [[MA208]] has the title, identical to the title of [[MA207]]
cf. above p. 416 note 127.
190 Minor differences between the two versions in regard to the timing of the Buddha’s visit, how Sakuludāyī behaved, and what mode of address he used, are the same as between [[MN77]] and its parallel [[MA207]] cf. above p. 416.

ludāyī. The description given by Sakuludāyī in the Majjhima-nikāya version would in
fact not correspond to the introductory narration of both discourses, according to which
the wanderers had been indulging in pointless talk, even though Sakuludāyī was present. [192]
According to the Madhyama-āgama version, after the Buddha had inquired three
times about the subject of the conversation interrupted upon his arrival, Sakuludāyī related that they had been discussing another teacher’s claim to omniscience. The topic
of a teacher who claimed to be omniscient forms the starting point for the discussion
between Sakuludāyī and the Buddha in both versions of the discourse. According to
the Madhyama-āgama presentation, then, it was the same topic that Sakuludāyī and his
followers had already been talking about.

MN II 31  The Cū�asakuludāyi-sutta identifies the teacher who had claimed omniscience to be
Niga��ha Nātaputta, whereas according to the Madhyama-āgama discourse all of the
six well-known contemporary teachers had made such a claim. [193] While other Pāli discourses record that Niga��ha Nātaputta had indeed claimed omniscience, [194] and in one
instance also attribute a claim to omniscience to Pūra�a Kassapa, [195] they do not report
that Makkhali Gosāla, Ajita Kesakambalī, Pakudha Kaccāyana, or Sañjaya Bela��hiputta had made such a claim. [196]
According to the Cū�asakuludāyi-sutta and its parallel, Sakuludāyī felt confident that
the Buddha would be able to answer questions about the past. The Buddha replied that
to answer questions about the past or the future would only be fruitful when conversing
with someone who was able to recall his past lives and had the divine eye. Sakuludāyī
had to admit that he was not even able to recollect events of his present life or to see a
spirit, let alone recall past lives or avail himself of the divine eye. [197]


192 [[MN79]] at MN II 30,1 and [[MA208]] at T I 783c12. Cf. also above p. 416, where the reference to the pointless talk in which the wanderers were engaged stands in contrast to the narrative flow of the parallel
[[MA207]] Thus [[MN77]] and [[MN79]] together with their parallels, give the impression that perhaps the
reciters just applied the standard description of pointless talk indiscriminately to any company of nonBuddhist wanderers. In fact, if to spend their time in such pointless and trivial chatter had been characteristic of Sakuludāyī and his company, one might also wonder why the Buddha is reported to have repeatedly approached such a company.

[[MA196]] at T I 753c8.
195 [[AN9.38]] at AN IV 428,20.
196 Another claimant to omniscience occurs in [[MA114]] at T I 603a8, according to which Uddaka Rāmaputta had also claimed to be omniscient. The Divyāvadāna in Cowell 1886: 143,9 or in Vaidya 1999: 89,6
agrees with [[MA208]] that the six teachers had all (mistakenly) claimed omniscience.
197 According to [[MA208]] at T I 784a27, the Buddha began his explanation by telling Sakuludāyī that for a
follower of a different tradition it was not possible to understand the meaning of what the Buddha had
taught. This remark is curious, since the Buddha had not yet delivered any teachings that Sakuludāyī
could have misunderstood. The same remark recurs in [[MN80]] at MN II 43,11 and its parallels [[MA209]]
at T I 787b2 and T 90 at T I 914b9, where it fits the context much better, as it occurs after the Buddha’s
interlocutor had indeed misunderstood a proposition made by the Buddha. [[MA208]] and [[MA209]] are


Chapter 8 Paribbājaka-vagga                                     -  433


According to the Majjhima-nikāya version, the Buddha next gave Sakuludāyī a suc- MN II 32
cinct presentation of the principle of dependent origination, a teaching not recorded in its
Madhyama-āgama parallel. [198]
The Cū�asakuludāyi-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama counterpart continue in similar
ways by relating that Sakuludāyī spoke in praise of the “highest splendour”, [199] yet was
unable to explain what such “highest splendour” implied. The Buddha then illustrated
the futility of such propositions with the image of a man who claims to be in love with
a girl he had never seen. [200] When Sakuludāyī compared his “highest splendour” to a
shining piece of jewellery, [201] the Buddha responded with a series of items of increasingly superior splendour, which in both versions cover:


fairly similar, as in both instances the Buddha is in discussion with a wanderer on a similar topic, delivering the same set of similes. Both discourse, moreover, follow each other in the Madhyama-āgama,
as is the case for their parallels in the Majjhima-nikāya. Hence, the passage about a follower of a different teaching who is unable to understand may have mistakenly made its way from [[MA209]] to [[MA208]] during the course of the discourse’s transmission.
198 [[MN79]] at MN II 32,5: “let be the past and let be the future, I will teach you the Dharma. When this exists, that comes to be” (etc.), ti��hatu pubbanto ti��hatu aparanto, dhamma� te desessāmi, imasmi� sati
ida� hoti (etc.) (S [e] -MN II 355,8: dhamman te). For the Buddha to come out with a succinct statement
on conditionality at this point is unexpected, since Sakuludāyī would hardly have been able to understand what was meant. The Pāli commentary explains that the Buddha knew Sakuludāyī would not be
able to understand, but nevertheless wanted to deliver this teaching since it would lead to a wholesome
mental impression on Sakuludāyī for the future, Ps III 272,11: “this he will all the more not understand,
but seeing that ‘in the future this will be a condition for his mental tendency’, the Blessed One spoke it”,
eva� pag’ eva na bujjhissati, anāgate pan’ assa vāsanāya paccayo bhavissatī ti disvā bhagavā evam
āha. This commentarial explanation revolves around the concept of vāsanā, a mental tendency or impression that leads to a particular interest or way of behaving in the future. The vāsanā theory appears
to be comparatively late, as this term is not found in the early discourses except for a single occurrence
as part of a compound in the Vatthugāthā of the Pārāyana-vagga, [[SN45.1]] at [[SNP1009]] pubbevāsanavāsitā (where one might even wonder if this could be an error for pubbenivāsa + √vas). On the comparative lateness of the Vatthugāthā in general cf. Jayawickrama 1948: 243-249 and Norman 1983a: 69.
Regarding this occurrence of the term vāsanā in [[SNP1009]] Jayawickrama 1948: 247 comments that “the
doctrine of vāsanā is apparently alien to early Buddhism ... this term does not occur in earlier Pāli works.
It is probable that the concept of pubbevāsanā was further developed into a fuller theory by the time of
the Commentaries”; cf. also Rhys Davids 1930: 83.

200 The same simile recurs in [[DN9]] at DN I 193,4 (in the context of a related discussion about the way to
an entirely pleasant world) and its parallel [[DA28]] at T I 111c16, in [[DN13]] at DN I 241,26 and its parallel [[DA26]] at T I 105c4, and in [[MN80]] at MN II 40,19 and its parallel [[MA209]] at T I 786b20. The version of this simile in the Dīrgha-āgama differs in as much as here the man claims to have already had
an affair with the girl, a specification not made in a version of this simile in the P���hapāla-sūtra fragment 420v6-8 in Melzer 2006: 272.
201 According to [[MN79]] at MN II 33,28, Sakuludāyī came out with a more explicit formulation of his view,
indicating that the “highest splendour” represents the self that survives unimpaired after death, eva�
va��o attā hoti arogo para� mara�ā ti (C [e] -MN II 382,6: param), a proclamation not found in [[MA208]] 彼色最勝, .
彼色最上 This additional qualification in [[MN79]] suggests Sakuludāyī’s view to correspond to the proposition of


434   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


      - a glow-worm,

      - a lamp,

      - a great fire,

      - the morning star,

      - the full moon,

      - the sun.
At the end of this series, the Buddha proclaimed that he did not speak of the “highest
splendour” even in regard to gods whose splendour surpasses the sun, whereon Sakuludāyī had to acknowledge defeat. [202]

MN II 35  The discussion in both versions turns to the path that leads to an entirely happy world,
which according to Sakuludāyī’s understanding requires abstaining from killing, theft,
sexual misconduct, and false speech. According to the Majjhima-nikāya version, Sakuludāyī also mentioned the need to engage in some form of asceticism as part of this path
to an entirely happy world, while according to the Madhyama-āgama presentation he
additionally mentioned the need to avoid any of the other unwholesome courses of action. [203]

MN II 36  Both versions highlight a contradiction in Sakuludāyī’s proposition, according to which
an entirely happy world could be reached by a path that involves the experience of both
pleasure and displeasure. They clarify that the path to an entirely happy world is rather
to be found in the development of the three jhānas.

a self that survives unimpaired after death, recorded in [[DN1]] at DN I 31,6 (cf. also [[MN102]] at MN II
229,1), a proposition that in the parallels [[DA21]] at T I 92b22, T 21 at T I 268b5, and Weller 1934: 48,13
does not specify that the self survives “unimpaired”, aroga, cf. also Skilling 1997a: 480 and below p.
591 note 24. The image of the shining jewel recurs in [[DN2]] at DN I 76,21, [[DN10]] at DN I 208,26, and
[[MN77]] at MN II 17,8 to illustrate the nature of consciousness in contrast to the physical body, and in
[[MN120]] at MN III 102,3 to describe the splendour of Brahmā.
202 According to [[MA208]] at T I 785b22, Sakuludāyī at this point changed from addressing the Buddha by
his name Gotama,, used by him so far, to the respectful address “Blessed One”,, and “Well
Gone One”,, found also in the corresponding passage in [[MN79]] at MN II 35,18. Yet, in [[MA208]]
at T I 785b25, i.e., right after this instance of using the respectful mode of address, Sakuludāyī returns
to use the address “Gotama”, except for another acknowledgement of defeat at T I 785c14, where he
again uses the more respectful way of address. These alternations suggest some textual error has occurred, since if Sakuludāyī had indeed at some point changed to the more respectful form of address,
thereby expressing his faith in the Buddha, it would be natural for him to continue in the same manner
instead of reverting again to a considerably less respectful form of address. Except for these instances,
the two Madhyama-āgama discourses in which Sakuludāyī takes part, [[MA207]] and [[MA208]] agree that
he addressed the Buddha by his name, while in their parallels [[MN77]] and [[MN79]] he throughout uses the
more respectful address normally employed by the Buddha’s disciples. 瞿曇 世尊
203 [[MN79]] at MN II 36, 善逝 1 speaks of undertaking and practising “some kind of asceticism”, aññatara� vā
pana tapogu�a�. After mentioning the need to abstain from killing, theft, sexual misconduct, and false
speech, [[MA208]] at T I 785c4 continues like this: “(up to) abstaining from wrong view he attains right
view”,, thereby indicating that the other courses of action       - abstaining from slander,
rough speech, useless chatter, covetousness, and ill will – should be supplemented. Regarding this
difference, the presentation in [[MN79]] seems closer to what could be expected from a non-Buddhist
wanderer like Sakuludāyī.
乃至離邪見得正見


Chapter 8 Paribbājaka-vagga                                     -  435


While the Majjhima-nikāya version directly comes out with a description of the three MN II 37
jhānas, its Madhyama-āgama counterpart approaches the same via a description of the
gradual path. This description begins with the arising of a Tathāgata and his teaching
of the Dharma, followed by depicting how someone goes forth and eventually overcomes
the hindrances and attains the three jhānas. [204] The Majjhima-nikāya version has a similar description of the gradual path at a later point. [205]
According to the Cū�asakuludāyi-sutta, the Buddha identified the attainment of the
three jhānas as the ‘path’ to an entirely happy world and proposed the fourth jhāna and
communion with those devas that dwell in an entirely happy world as the ‘realization’
of an entirely happy world. [206] The Madhyama-āgama account, however, presents attainment of the three jhānas as the ‘realization’ of the entirely happy world and communion with devas of the corresponding realms as the ‘path’ to an entirely happy world,
thereby perhaps confusing the path with the goal. [207]
According to the Pāli commentary, the reference to the fourth jhāna points to the
need to develop the psychic powers that enable visiting the celestial realm of the Subhaki��a realm. [208] From this perspective, the Cū�asakuludāyi-sutta’s stipulation of attainment of the fourth jhāna for being able to “realize” an entirely happy world would fit
better than the third jhāna mentioned in the Madhyama-āgama version, since for developing the psychic power required for celestial travels the fourth jhāna would be required according to the standard presentation of the attainment of supernormal powers
in other discourses.
In both versions, Sakuludāyī inquired whether this entirely pleasant world was the
goal of living the holy life as a disciple of the Buddha, which the Buddha denied. In the
Madhyama-āgama version, this denial caused an uproar among the followers of Sakuludāyī. [209] A similar uproar occurs in the Majjhima-nikāya version at an earlier point,
after the Buddha had indicated that even with the third jhāna an entirely pleasant world
has not yet been reached. [210]
Hence, although the two versions present this reaction at different junctions of their
narration, they agree that the reason for this uproar was that the Buddha had pointed
out something that is superior to the third jhāna. This suggests the third jhāna and rebirth in the corresponding celestial realm to have been the goal aspired to by Sakuludā

205 [[MN79]] at MN II 38,4.
206 [[MN79]] at MN II 37,24; as noted by Masefield 1983: 79, the present passage reflects “the traditional belief that it is possible to make contact with the devas of a particular region of the Brahmaloka through
entering into the appropriate jhāna”.
207 [[MA208]] at T I 786a5+17.
208 Ps III 275,15 distinguishes between “realization obtained [on rebirth]”, pa�ilābhasacchikiriyā, and “present realization”, paccakkhasacchikiriyā, explaining that for the latter the fourth jhāna is required, so
that through the exercise of psychic power, iddhivikubbanā, the Subhaki��a realm can be visited in
one’s present life.

yī and his followers, presumably being the type of experience reckoned by them as the
“highest splendour”.

MN II 38  The Majjhima-nikāya version presents its account of the gradual path at this point, a
description that begins with the arising of a Tathāgata and his teaching of the Dharma,
which inspires someone to go forth (etc.), eventually culminating in the attainment of
the four jhānas and the three higher knowledges.
This account does not fit its context too well, since the Cū�asakuludāyi-sutta follows
each attainment of a jhāna and of a higher knowledge with the declaration that this is a
state superior to the entirely happy world discussed earlier. In this way, it proposes that
each of the jhānas mentioned in its description of the gradual path is superior to the four
jhānas mentioned in its exposition of the path to an entirely happy world. [211]
This contradictory presentation suggests that a shift of the description of the gradual
path away from its original location may have taken place in the Majjhima-nikāya version. Judging from the Madhyama-āgama discourse, the original location of the gradual path exposition would have been at the outset of the description of the path to an
entirely happy world, at which point the practice of the gradual path up to the attainment of the jhānas would come in its proper place.
The remainder of the gradual path, which describes the development of the three higher
knowledges, does, however, stand in its proper place in the present context, where it
forms the reply to Sakuludāyī’s question after the goal of the holy life.
Yet, according to the Madhyama-āgama version at the present junction the Buddha
only mentioned the fourth jhāna. [212] This could be a loss of text, since it would be unusual for the Buddha to stop short at the fourth jhāna in reply to a question about the
goal of living the holy life under him, without bringing in the topic of realization.

MN II 39  The two versions agree that Sakuludāyī was highly inspired by this discourse, [213] recording in slightly different ways how an intervention by his company of wanderers
prevented Sakuludāyī from becoming a disciple of the Buddha. [214]

211 [[MN79]] at MN II 38,8: “he dwells having attained the first jhāna. This, Udāyī, is a state superior and

212 [[MA208]] at T I 786b1.
213 According to [[MN79]] at MN II 39,18, Sakuludāyī expressed his wish to go forth under the Buddha. [[MA208]] at T I 786b4 does not report him explicitly requesting ordination, although it records that he worshipped the Buddha, at which point his assembled followers told him to behave in accordance with his
status as a teacher and asked him whether he intended to become a disciple of the Buddha.
214 Ps III 275,29 explains this intervention to be the karmic result of a deed of Sakuludāyī in a former life,
when he had encouraged a monk to disrobe in order to inherit this monk’s requisites. Hecker 1972: 179
draws attention to the contrast between [[MN79]] and [[MN76]] the former depicting the readiness of the wanderer Sakuludāyī to go forth, even though he was a renowned teacher, whereas according to [[MN76]] at
MN I 524,6 the wanderer Sandaka was sufficiently convinced by Ānanda’s exposition to recommend
his disciples to go forth as Buddhist monks, but was himself too attached to his gains and honours to do
the same.

[[MN80]] Vekhanassa-sutta

The Vekhanassa-sutta, the “discourse to Vekhanassa”, records a discussion between
the Buddha and the wanderer Vekhanassa. [215] This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama and another parallel in an individual translation. [216]
The Vekhanassa-sutta and its two parallels describe in similar terms that the wanderer Vekhanassa came to visit the Buddha and spoke in praise of the “highest splendour”. According to the Pāli commentary, Vekhanassa was the teacher of Sakuludāyī
and had heard that Sakuludāyī had been unsuccessful in upholding the teaching on the
“highest splendour” in front of the Buddha (as recorded in the Cū�asakuludāyi-sutta
and its parallel). [217] Vekhanassa had thereon decided to come all the way from Rājagaha
to Sāvatthī in order to confront the Buddha himself.
The Vekhanassa-sutta and its parallels depict the first part of the exchange between
Vekhanassa and the Buddha in the same way as the Cū�asakuludāyi-sutta and its parallel describe the exchange between Sakuludāyī and the Buddha, covering the Buddha’s
delivery of the simile of someone in love with a beautiful girl he had never seen, his
interlocutor illustrating the “highest splendour” by comparing it to a shining piece of
jewellery, and the Buddha depicting an ascending series of radiances ranging from a
glow-worm to the sun.
At this point, the Vekhanassa-sutta and its parallels turn to the topic of sensual pleasures, a presentation the Majjhima-nikāya account concludes by speaking of the “highest sensual happiness”, kāmaggasukha. [218] The parallels to the Vekhanassa-sutta present


215 Be-MN II 231,3 gives the name of this wanderer as Vekhanasa and Se-MN II 367,1 as Vekha�asa. The
name of the protagonist of [[MN80]] brings to mind the Vaikhānasa hermits of the Brahminical tradition;
cf., e.g., Eggers 1929 for a translation and study of their Dharmasūtra.
216 The parallels are [[MA209]] at T I 786b-788a and T 90 at T I 913c-914c. According to the information
given in the Taishō edition, T 90 was translated by Gu�abhadra. [[MA209]] and T 90 agree with [[MN80]]
on locating the discourse in Jeta’s Grove near Sāvatthī and on taking the name of the main protagonist
as title, thus [[MA209]] is the “discourse to Vekhanassa”,, and T 90 the “discourse spoken
by the Buddha to Vekhanassa”, . For remarks on [[MA209]] cf. Minh Chau 1964/1991: 62;

the range of meaning of kāma in Sanskrit literature cf. also Hara 2007: 82-87. That the expression kāmagga does indeed refer to the “topmost” or “peak” of sensual pleasures, in the sense of being the high- 鞞摩那修經
est type of sensual pleasure, can 佛說鞞摩肅經 be seen in parallel constructions such as bhavagga, “highest [point of] existence”, found in [[SN22.76]] at SN III 83,14 and also in [[AN4.75]] at AN II 79,5, a discourse which has
several other similar expressions, such as the “highest [type of] ethical conduct”, sīlagga, the “highest

[type of] liberation”, vimuttagga, or the “highest [type of] perception”, saññagga, etc. According to Ps
III 277,19, in the present context “‘highest sensual happiness refers to Nirvā�a”, kāmaggasukhan ti nibbāna� adhippeta�. For a more detailed discussion cf. Anālayo 2007g: 97-98.

the Buddha’s exposition of sensual pleasures in a different manner. According to them,
the Buddha distinguished between sense objects that are agreeable and sense objects
that are disagreeable, concluding that, compared to disagreeable sense objects, agreeable sense objects appear to provide the supreme form of happiness. [219]
Hence, judging from these versions, the Buddha simply acknowledged that to obtain
desirable sensual objects provides gratification. This acknowledgement may have been
the first step in an examination of sensual pleasures from the perspective of their gratification (assāda), their danger (ādīnava), and the release from them (nissara�a), an examination apparently interrupted before its completion by Vekhanassa, who according
to all versions expressed his approval. [220]

MN II 43  According to the Vekhanassa-sutta and its parallels, the Buddha was quick to point
out that this approval was based on a misunderstanding. He explained that a follower
of a different type of teaching and practice, like Vekhanassa, could easily misunderstand
him, since only his arahant disciples were beyond misunderstanding his exposition.
The implication of this statement appears to be that arahant disciples are incapable of
misunderstanding a description of the gratification of sensual pleasures by the Buddha,
since by having eradicated all sensual lust they are beyond the attraction of sensual
pleasures and have fully understood their deceptive nature. Vekhanassa, however, apparently misunderstood the Buddha’s statement to be an approval of sensual desires, in
the sense that agreeable sense objects constitute the peak of happiness. [221]
The Vekhanassa-sutta and its parallels note that the Buddha’s reply irritated Vekhanassa to such an extent that he reacted by deriding the claim of those who, without possessing knowledge of the past and the future, profess to have reached realization. The
way this statement is formulated suggests that Vekhanassa was referring to recollection
of past lives and knowledge of the re-arising of beings in accordance with their deeds. [222]


219 [[MA209]] at T I 787a21 and T 90 at T I 914a29.
220 While according to [[MN80]] at MN II 43,8 Vekhanassa approved by indicating that the Buddha’s proposal was well spoken, subhāsita, according to [[MA209]] at T I 787a27 he approved by commenting that
“the recluse Gotama has explained to me in various ways sensual pleasure and the foremost sensual
pleasure”, . In [[MA209]] Vekhanassa then continues by illustrating his understanding of the Buddha’s proposition with the example of using grass that is on fire
to ignite wood or wood that is on fire to ignite grass (the simile in T 90 at T I 914b6 differs, as it speaks
of fire that depends on wood and grass). The fire imagery found in both Chinese versions seems to convey Vekhanassa’s approval of providing fuel for the ‘fire’ of sensual delight.
221 This suggests his way of thinking to have been similar to the hedonistic affirmation of sense pleasures
apparently implicit in the position taken by the wanderer Māgandiya in [[MN75]] at MN I 503,18 and its
parallel [[MA153]] at T I 670c16. This parallelism might help to explain why the commentary to [[MN80]]
was led to gloss kāmaggasukha as a reference to Nirvā�a, as according to [[MN75]] at MN I 508,30 and
[[MA153]] at T I 672a29, during his discussion with Māgandiya the Buddha indeed referred to the supreme
happiness of Nirvā�a, 沙門瞿曇為我無量方便說欲樂, nibbāna� parama� sukha� 欲樂第一 and . Given that [[MN80]] at MN II 43,14,
moreover, indicates that the Buddha’s arahant disciples will not misunderstand a reference he makes to
kāmaggasukha, the commentators perhaps came to the conclusion that the preceding statement must be
related to Nirvā�[[AN222]] Vekhanassa’s reference to knowing the past appears to intend recollection of past lives, since [[MA209]]

Chapter 8 Paribbājaka-vagga                                     -  439


According to the Majjhima-nikāya version, the Buddha acknowledged Vekhanassa’s MN II 44
criticism by replying that those who make such claims are rightly to be censured. [223] The
Buddha then changed topic and told Vekhanassa to let be past and future, proclaiming
that he was able to guide a sincere disciple to realization.
As it stands, the Majjhima-nikāya version’s presentation strikes an unexpected note.
It is surprising for the Buddha to acknowledge Vekhanassa’s criticism in this way, since
to know past and future is elsewhere not reckoned a necessary requisite for full awakening. Although both will result from developing the three higher knowledges, the destruction of the influxes can also be reached without developing the other two higher
knowledges.
According to the parallel versions, the Buddha did not acknowledge Vekhanassa’s
criticism. They report that the Buddha, who had realized that Vekhanassa was speaking
out of anger, instead replied that for those who claim realization without knowing past
and future it would be proper to let be past and future. [224] Having in this way set aside
knowledge of past and future as irrelevant, according to the Chinese versions the Buddha then told Vekhanassa to also let be past and future, an injunction similarly found in
the Pāli account. [225]
The Chinese versions agree with the Pāli discourse that the Buddha proclaimed to be
able to guide a sincere disciple to realization. According to their account, however, he
made a point of explaining that he was able to guide a disciple to realization even if
this disciple should be unable to remember a single birth. [226]
In this way, the Chinese versions make it clear that the Buddha disagreed with Vekhanassa’s assumption that knowledge of the past and the future are necessary for realization. According to them, concern with past and future can be dispensed with, as
even without recollecting a single birth it will be possible to reach awakening. This
presentation fits the present context better than an acknowledgement of Vekhanassa’s
criticism.
According to the Pāli account, the Buddha illustrated his ability to guide a sincere
disciple to realization with the example of an infant bound with a five-fold bond, an


at T I 787b10 speaks additionally of knowing “endless births and deaths”,, and T 90 at T I
914b17 of “infinite births in the world”, . Ps III 278,5 similarly refers to pubbenivāsañā�a
and dibbacakkhuñā�a in its gloss on the Buddha’s reply to Vekhanassa.
223 [[MN80]] at MN II 44,3: “this censure of theirs is in accordance with what is proper”, tesa� so yeva sahadhammiko niggaho hoti.
224 According to [[MA209]] at T I 787b28, in regard to recluses and Brahmins who claim realization without
knowing past and future, “for them it would be fitting to make this statement: ‘let be the world’s past,
let be the world’s future’”,, a proposition similarly made in T 90 at
T I 914b28: .
225 [[MN80]] at MN II 44,4: ti��hatu pubbanto ti��hatu aparanto.
226 [[MA209]] at T I 787c1: “even without recalling a single birth, a monk disciple of mine who comes ... 無窮生死

image that might represent the five-fold bondage of sensual pleasures. [227] Once grown
up and released from these bonds, the child will know to be free from bondage.
The Chinese versions’ presentation of the same simile offers further details. They mention that the parents had bound the child’s hand and feet. The idea behind this might be
that the parents wanted to prevent the child from harming itself, as can easily happen
when an infant is left unattended and is able to move around freely. This assumption receives support from the Pāli commentary, which indicates that the bondage has the purpose of protecting the child. [228]
According to the Chinese versions, once grown up the child will no longer be bound,
independent of whether or not it recalls having been bound up when it was still an infant. [229] This ties in well with the preceding topic on knowledge of past and future, as it
illustrates that the child’s freedom from bondage is the result of its growth and maturity, independent of any knowledge of what happened in the past. In this way, the simile
in the Chinese versions comes as an appropriate illustration of the fact that knowledge
of the past, and by implication also knowledge of the future, are not necessary for freedom from bondage.
The Chinese versions continue with two more similes. These similes illustrate how a
sincere disciple reaches realization with the example of an oil lamp and the example of
a wood fire, both of which will be extinguished when no further oil or wood is supplied. [230]
The Vekhanassa-sutta concludes with Vekhanassa taking refuge as a lay follower.
This conclusion is puzzling, since if he had indeed been convinced by the Buddha’s exposition, it would have been more natural for him to request ordination, all the more
since the Buddha had quite explicitly indicated that he was able to lead a sincere disciple to realization. Thus, for Vekhanassa to become a lay disciple, which would imply
that he reverted from the life of a wanderer to the lay life, seems a rather improbable
reaction.
According to the parallel versions, Vekhanassa rather attained stream-entry during
this discourse, requested the going forth and in due course became an arahant. [231]


227 [[MN80]] at MN II 44,9. However, to interpret the image as representing the pleasures of the five senses
would not be applicable to [[MA209]] at T I 787c4 and T 90 at T I 914c4, as both speak only of the child’s
hands and feet being bound, without mentioning a fifth bondage (which according to the Pāli commentarial gloss would have been placed around its neck, cf. note 228 below).
228 Ps III 278,9: “for the purpose of protection they bind his hands, feet, and neck with strings”, tassa hi
ārakkhatthāya hatthapādesu ceva gīvāya ca suttakāni bandhanti.

230 [[MA209]] at T I 787c10 and T 90 at T I 914c7. These similes thus provide a contrast to the fire simile
used in [[MA209]] at T I 787a28 and T 90 at T I 914b6 by Vekhanassa to illustrate his approval of the
highest sensual pleasure, indicating to him that the task is not to ignite the fire of sensuality, but rather
to deprive it of fuel. The same image regarding the extinction of a fire can be found in [[SN12.52]] at SN
II 85,17 and its parallel [[SA286]] at T II 80b17, while the image of the extinction of a lamp recurs in [[SN12.53]] at SN II 86,22 and its parallel [[SA285]] at T II 80b1.

## Chapter 9 Rāja-vagga

[[MN81]] Gha�īkāra-sutta

The Gha�īkāra-sutta, the “discourse about Gha�īkāra”, is a jātaka tale of a potter who
lived at the time of the former Buddha Kassapa. [1] This discourse has a parallel in the
Madhyama-āgama. [2] The same tale recurs, moreover, in the Mahāvastu of the Mahāsā�ghika-Lokottaravāda Vinaya, in the Sa�ghabhedavastu of the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda
Vinaya, preserved in Sanskrit and Tibetan, and in a Chinese Avadāna collection. [3] In
addition to these, a few words of a version of this discourse have been preserved in
Sanskrit fragments. [4]
The Gha�īkāra-sutta, its Madhyama-āgama parallel, and the Mahāvastu account begin by describing that the Buddha displayed a smile. Asked by Ānanda for the reason, [5]
the Buddha explained that in the very same spot where they stood, the former Buddha
Kassapa once sat and taught his monks. [6]

2 The parallel is [[MA63]] at T I 499a-503a, entitled after Gha�īkāra’s hometown ; for a partial translation of [[MA63]] together with extracts from the present discussion, cf. Anālayo 2009c. [[MN81]] and [[MA63]] are both located in the chapter dedicated to the topic of ‘kings’ in the Majjhima-nikāya and in the
Madhyama-āgama, the Rāja-vagga or . The (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Bhai�ajyavastu in Dutt
1984a: 217,12 also locates the present discourse in the Rājasa�yukta of the Madhyama-āgama. As already noted above p. 6, this allocation is unexpected in so far as the two main protagonists of the discourse are a potter and a Brahmin youth, neither of which is a king. Although the king of Vārā�asī also
appears in the discourse, he plays only a relatively minor role. The Madhyama-āgama edition in its
introduction on p. 17 suggests that the present tale was allocated to the chapter on kings in order to show
how past and contemporary kings took refuge and accepted the Buddha’s teachings (
, ). 鞞婆陵

442   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


In the Sa�ghabhedavastu, however, a smile by the Buddha does not provide the occasion for the delivery of the present tale. Instead, the reason for relating events at the
time of the former Buddha Kassapa was to explain to the monks the karma that was responsible for the six years of asceticism spent by Gotama during the time before his
awakening. [7]
In agreement with its parallels, the Gha�īkāra-sutta narrates that at the time of the
Buddha Kassapa there were two friends, a potter and a Brahmin youth. The Majjhimanikāya version introduces the potter under the name of Gha�īkāra and the Brahmin
youth as Jotipāla (later on identified with the Buddha Gotama in a previous life). [8]
The Mahāvastu tale agrees with the Pāli version on these two names, [9] while the
Madhyama-āgama version and the Sa�ghabhedavastu speak instead of the potter Nandīpāla and the Brahmin youth Uttara. [10] When referring to Nandīpāla, the Sa�ghabhedavastu qualifies him to be a “maker of pots”, thereby also employing the term that in the
Pāli version is his proper name. [11] The Chinese Avadāna account combines features from

Gnoli 1978a: 22,1 and the Bhai�ajyavastu in Dutt 1984a: 217,11 speak of Vaibhi�i�gī, cf. also D (1)
’dul ba, ga 4a1 or Q (1030) nge 3b3. According to the Mahāvastu in Basak 1963a: 411,8 or in Senart
1882a: 318,12, not only Buddha Kāśyapa, but also the two earlier Buddhas had been seated on the same
spot. Oldenberg 1912a: 138 comments that the sudden introduction of three Buddhas stands in contrast
to the preceding account, which is concerned only with Kāśyapa Buddha, hence this reference to three
Buddhas appears to be a maladroit attempt to improve on this passage (“ein ungeschickter Versuch ...
den Effekt zu steigern”). Mus 1935: 481 notes that references to such locations used by former Buddhas
point to a simple form of cult, before sacred iconography and architecture became important; cf. also the
discussion in Strong 2004: 36-39.
7 Gnoli 1978a: 21,31, with its Tibetan counterpart in D (1) ’dul ba, ga 3b6 or Q (1030) nge 3b1. The same
is also implicit in T 197 at T IV 172c5, which gives the title of the present tale as “discourse spoken by
the Buddha on the causes in former existences [for his present undertaking of] ascetic practices”,
.
8 While Ee-MN II 46,2 and Ce-MN II 404,23 spell his name as Gha�īkāra, Be-MN II 236,27 and Se-MN II

as a former life of the Buddha as a Brahmin youth at the time of Kassapa Buddha. The name Uttara for 佛說
苦行宿緣經 the same former life of Gotama Buddha recurs also in the Avadānaśataka, e.g., in Speyer 1906/1970:
239,7, id. 1909/1970: 23,5, 51,8, and 88,1, or in Vaidya 1958a: 105,20, 184,21, 196,23, and 212,30, and

who goes forth as a Buddhist monk is also recorded in Bv 12.11-12 at Bv 53, 儲提摩麗 21 and Jā I 37,31, although,

both of these two naming traditions, as it speaks of the potter Nandīpāla and his Brahmin friend Jotipāla. [12]
The different versions describe how the potter Gha�īkāra (or Nandīpāla) tried to convince his friend Jotipāla (or Uttara) to visit Kassapa Buddha. [13] According to the Gha�īkāra-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel, Jotipāla was disinclined to visit Kassapa
Buddha, since he thought it useless to go to see such “bald-headed recluses”. [14] The
Madhyama-āgama discourse, the Sa�ghabhedavastu, and the Chinese Avadāna account
report that Jotipāla expressed his disbelief in Kassapa Buddha’s awakening, which he
apparently held to require the undertaking of ascetic practices. [15]
The Sa�ghabhedavastu, in agreement with the Chinese, Pāli, and Tibetan Apadāna/
Avadāna collections, notes that Jotipāla’s disdain for Kassapa’s awakening had dire
karmic repercussions. [16] When reborn as Gotama, the Buddha-to-be, as a result of this


12 T 197 at T IV 172c13 speaks of Nandīpāla,, introduced as a potter’s son,, but gives
the name of his Brahmin friend as, which according to Akanuma 1930/1994: 251 stands for Jotipāla. Karashima 2006: 361 notes another rendering of Jotipāla or Jyotipāla as, found in [[DA3]] at T I
31b23, where the use of the character “indicates that -pāla (‘guard’) had become -māla (= mālā ‘wreath,
garland’)”. The same appears to be the case for the second character in the rendering adopted in T 197.
13 [[MA63]] at T I 500a12 and the Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1978a: 23,9 and D (1) ’dul ba, ga 5a1 or Q
(1030) nge 4b1 indicate that Gha�īkāra was just coming from the presence of Kassapa Buddha when he
met his friend Jotipāla, who was driving out of town in the company of other Brahmin youths. According to the Sanskrit text of the Sa�ghabhedavastu, Jotipāla wanted to teach the other Brahmin youths the
reciting of Brahminical hyms, Gnoli 1978a: 23,13: brāhma�akān mantrān vācayitukāma�, while the
Tibetan version in D (1) ’dul ba, ga 5a2 or Q 難提婆羅 (1030) nge 4b3 only indicates that he “wanted to make the 瓦師子
Brahmins (the Brahmin youths) recite 火鬘 ”, bram ze (Q adds: khye’u) rnams klog tu ’jug par ’dod nas. In
[[MA63]] at T I 500a15, Jotipāla wanted to instruct them to recite Brahminical 焰鬘 “scriptures”,
(according to Hirakawa 1997: 613 and Soothill 1937/2000: 326, 鬘 renders √likh, lekha, and pustaka).
In regard to a comparable reference in [[DN27]] at DN III 94,18 to gantha (a term that usually means “book”)
as a Brahminical occupation, Gombrich 1990b: 27 notes that in [[SNP2.7]] at [[SNP302]] and 306 “Brahmins are
said to ‘knot together mantras’ – the words are mante ganthetvā – and the reference is to their composing Vedic texts”. The same sense would underlie the reference to ‘making books’, ganthe karontā, in
[[DN27]] or to ‘scriptures’,, in [[MA63]] in the sense of oral composition or recitation.

to “difficult”,, in [[MA63]] and T 197 might intend du�kara, as suggested by the parallel passage in the
Sa�ghabhedavastu, Gnoli 1978a: 23,19: kutas tasmin mu��ake śrama�ake bodhi�, bodhir hi paramadu�karā, a term that recurs again in Gnoli 1978a: 21,31 in relation to the Buddha’s practice of austerities

The standard rendering for the second instance of du�karacaryā in the sense of “ascetic practice 書 ”, however, would be, cf., e.g., [[MA152]] at T I 669b19, discussed below p. 576 note 238.

former deed he had to undertake ascetic practices for six years before reaching liberation, thereby apparently having to prove to himself that such practices were not required for awakening. [17]
According to the Gha�īkāra-sutta, when the potter’s repeated invitation to visit Kassapa Buddha met with Jotipāla’s firm refusal, Gha�īkāra suggested that they go and
bathe instead. While the Madhyama-āgama version and the Sa�ghabhedavastu do not
record this interlude, the Mahāvastu and the Chinese Avadāna account proceed in a
way that is similar to the Pāli discourse. The Mahāvastu indicates that the idea to go
and bathe had come to Gha�īkāra as an expedient means, since the place for bathing
was close to where Kassapa Buddha was staying. [18]

MN II 47  When they had washed their heads, according to the Majjhima-nikāya account Gha�īkāra repeated his request and, when Jotipāla kept on refusing, Gha�īkāra seized Jotipāla first by his belt and then by his hair. [19] The Mahāvastu reports that Gha�īkāra had
gone so far as to seize Jotipāla’s hair because Jotipāla had pushed him away and was
about to leave. [20]
In this way, the Mahāvastu explains why Gha�īkāra undertook an action that would
have been a serious breach of etiquette in view of the ancient Indian respect for the
head and the fact that the potter Gha�īkāra was of a considerably lower social standing
than the Brahmin Jotipāla. [21] According to the Chinese Avadāna account, this action
was so outrageous that in this part of ancient India it was punishable with the death
penalty. [22]

dāna “is used with the meaning of ‘cutting (in an agricultural sense) or reaping’”. Ibid. p. 6 concludes
that the nuance of “‘reapings’ enables us to understand the apadāna-s as stories to illustrate the reaping
in a present life of the fruit (phala) or result of good or bad deeds performed in the past”. For another
shade of meaning cf. Neelis 2008: 152, who notes the existence of a type of avadāna that are edifying
narrations without references to a story from the past. Another point relevant to an appreciation of this
genre of texts would be the suggestion by Granoff 1996: 88 that avadāna tales may have been meant
specifically for a monastic audience.

counterpart cf. Bechert 1961: 238-239. The Bhai�ajyavastu in Dutt 1984a: 217,15 also considers Gotama’s ascetic practices to be the karmic result of his former life as Uttara (or Jotipāla), cf. also the Bodhisattvāvadāna-kalpalatā résumé in Mitra 1882/1971: 58; on this motif cf. also Cutler 1997: 73, Hara
1997: 250-253, Guang Xing 2002a: 21, Strong 2001: 33, and Walters 1990: 77. A further step is then
taken in the Upāyakauśalya-sūtra, which reasons that the bodhisattva’s reluctance was only a skilful
means in order to convince some friends to visit the Buddha Kassapa as well, T 310 at T XI 602b3, cf.
also Tatz 1994/2001: 62-65.

The Gha�īkāra-sutta and its parallels agree that this drastic action was effective and
overcame Jotipāla’s resistance. The two friends thereupon visited Kassapa Buddha,
who delivered a discourse to them. [23] This discourse inspired Jotipāla to go forth. Gha�īkāra could not do the same, as he had to support his blind parents. [24]
The Chinese Avadāna tale takes a different route at this point. It reports how Jotipāla
noticed that Kassapa had thirty of the marks of a superior being (mahāpurisalakkha�a)
and requested in verse to be shown the other two. [25] On ascertaining that Kassapa had
all thirty-two marks, Jotipāla was filled with faith. Kassapa then gave him a description
of the conduct of a bodhisattva, [26] on hearing of which Jotipāla had to confess that he
had not kept up such a conduct. [27]
In this way, the Chinese Avadāna tale focuses on the meeting between Jotipāla and
Kassapa Buddha as a stage in the bodhisattva career of the future Buddha Gotama.
Quite probably due to taking this perspective, the Chinese Avadāna account does not
cover the later events described in the Gha�īkāra-sutta and its other parallels, events in
which Jotipāla no longer plays a role.
The Majjhima-nikāya and Madhyama-āgama discourses and their counterparts in the
Mahāvastu and the Sa�ghabhedavastu continue by describing how Kassapa Buddha arrived in Vārā�asī. King Kiki of Vārā�asī treated the Buddha and his monks to a meal,
at the completion of which the king invited Kassapa Buddha to spend the three months
of the rainy season at Vārā�asī, promising his abundant support. [28] Kassapa Buddha,
however, did not accept the king’s invitation. [29]

Indian context, Hara 1986a: 71-72 explains that in a fighting situation “the seizure of the hair in single
combat means complete control over one’s adversary”, as “once he succeeds in holding his adversary’s
hair, he is in a position to behead him”. Therefore, “being held by the hair is an unbearable humiliation”.
Outside of a battle context, forcefully grabbing the hair of another, such as, e.g., one’s teacher or of another’s wife, are similarly humiliating and therefore “censured as an ignoble act” (ibid. p. 83).
23 The Mahāvastu in Basak 1963a: 416,4 or in Senart 1882a: 321,18 reports that before delivering the discourse, Kāśyapa Buddha wanted to give the three refuges and the five precepts to his visitors. Jyotipāla,
however, said that he could not take all the five precepts, since he still had to kill someone. Asked by
Kāśyapa whom he needed to kill, Jyotipāla explained that he had to kill Gha�īkāra for having seized his
hair. This slightly bizarre episode thus agrees with the Chinese Avadāna version’s indication that Gha�īkāra’s action was a rather serious deed. On the idea of taking only some out of the five precepts in general cf. Agostini 2008.
24 Bailey 2003: 247 explains that “Gha�īkāra ... is the archetypal image of the village lay Buddhist”, and
that “the symbolism of the blind parents, found often elsewhere in Indian literature ... lends more dramatic emphasis to his domestic responsibility”.

28 While [[MN81]] at MN II 50,25 only implicitly refers to the support the king was willing to give with the
expression “like this will be the maintenance of the community”, evarūpa� sa�ghassa upa��hāna� bhavissatī ti, thereby indicating that he would continue to offer supplies similar to the meal offering he had
just made, the Mahāvastu and the Sa�ghabhedavastu give a detailed description of the dwellings and
supplies the king intended to provide, cf. Basak 1963a: 422,7 or Senart 1882a: 325,17, Gnoli 1978a: 26,3
and D (1) ’dul ba, ga 7a6 or Q (1030) nge 6b5. [[MA63]] at T I 501a22 similarly reports that the king listed

Kassapa’s refusal to accept the invitation upset the king and prompted him to inquire
if Kassapa Buddha had a better supporter. [30] Kassapa confirmed that this was the case
and told the king that his supporter was the potter Gha�īkāra. The Mahāvastu draws out
in more detail the point made in the present passage, as it describes that the king asked
Kassapa (Kāśyapa) what kind of wealth this potter had so as to be able to support the
Buddha and the community of monks. [31] Kassapa replied by describing Gha�īkāra’s virtuous conduct, explaining that this was the potter’s wealth.

MN II 51  The Majjhima-nikāya and Madhyama-āgama discourses and their counterparts in the
Mahāvastu and the Sa�ghabhedavastu agree in their description of Gha�īkāra’s exemplary conduct, recording that he had adopted a behaviour that closely resembles the
monastic code of conduct. Thus, he would not even dig the earth to make pots, but only
take clay that had fallen off naturally. Moreover, he did not sell his pots, but offered
them in free exchange for beans and rice. [32] By avoiding the harm caused to creatures
through digging the ground and by abstaining from sale and barter, Gha�īkāra was
adopting rules usually only incumbent on and compatible with the life of a monastic. [33]
While the Majjhima-nikāya account indicates that Gha�īkāra was a non-returner, the
Madhyama-āgama version and the Sa�ghabhedavastu present him as a stream-enterer. [34] The Majjhima-nikāya presentation receives support from a discourse found in
the Sa�yutta-nikāya and in two Sa�yukta-āgama collections. These three discourses
report that Gha�īkāra, who had been reborn as a deva, paid a visit to Gotama Buddha in

the number of dwellings and the sumptuous food he wished to give. These descriptions further enhance
the contrast between the king’s material wealth and Gha�īkāra’s spiritual wealth.
29 The Mahāvastu in Basak 1963a: 389-409 or Senart 1882a: 303-317 provides some additional background
to Kāśyapa’s refusal to spend the rainy season in Vārā�asī, as it precedes the story of Gha�īkāra and Jyotipāla with a narration of what took place earlier between Kāśyapa and the king, a tale also found in the
Mahīśāsaka Vinaya, T 1421 at T XXII 172a7. According to this tale, the veneration and support shown
by the king’s daughter to Kāśyapa and his monks had infuriated the local Brahmin community. Events
had escalated up to the point where the Brahmins demanded that the king’s daughter be killed and (according to the Mahāvastu) even employed assassins to kill Kāśyapa Buddha, cf. Basak 1963a: 404,13 or
Senart 1882a: 313,19. Given such feelings of resentment among the local Brahmin community, it would
be natural for the story to continue with Kāśyapa preferring to spend the rainy season elsewhere, in order to avoid exacerbating the situation.
30 According to the Mahāvastu in Basak 1963a: 422,14 or in Senart 1882a: 326,4, the king was so upset
that he even started to cry.
31 Basak 1963a: 423,4 or Senart 1882a: 326,12.
32 [[MN81]] at MN II 51,24, [[MA63]] at T I 502a5, Basak 1963a: 424,2 or Senart 1882a: 326,19, Gnoli 1978a:
26,24 and D (1) ’dul ba, ga 4a4 or Q (1030) nge 3b6; cf. also T 197 at T IV 172c16.
33 This becomes all the more evident in the detailed description of Gha�īkāra’s virtuous conduct in [[MA63]]
which notes that he would not accept livestock, slaves, land, and grains, etc., a description similar to the
standard description of proper ethical conduct for recluses found, e.g., in [[DN1]] at DN I 5,12.
34 [[MN81]] at MN I 51,16 notes that Gha�īkāra was free from doubt in relation to the three jewels and the four
noble truths, thereby implicitly indicating that he had attained stream-entry, an indication also made in
[[MA63]] at T I 501b12, and in Gnoli 1978a: 26,22 as well as in D (1) ’dul ba, ga 4a3 or Q (1030) nge 3b5.
[[MN81]] at MN I 52,2 then concludes its description by specifying that Gha�īkāra had destroyed the five
lower fetters, thereby specifying that he had progressed to the level of non-returning.


Chapter 9 Rāja-vagga                                        -  447


order to brief him on the progress made by some monks reborn in the Pure Abodes, [35]
realms in which according to Buddhist cosmology only non-returners are reborn. The
two Chinese versions explicitly indicate that Gha�īkāra had been reborn as a non-returner in the Pure Abodes, [36] a fact also implicit in their Pāli counterpart, since for him
to know what was taking place in the Pure Abodes suggest that he would have been
living there himself and thus would also be a non-returner.
The Mahāvastu also reports that Gha�īkāra took rebirth in the Pure Abodes. According to its account, in his life as an inhabitant of the Pure Abodes Gha�īkāra again played
an important role in helping his former friend Jotipāla (Jyotipāla), now reborn as the
bodhisattva Gotama, the Buddha-to-be. The Mahāvastu account indicates that the deva
Gha�īkāra, together with other devas of the Pure Abodes, was responsible for conjuring
up the sight of an old man, a sick man, a dead man, and a recluse − sights that stirred
the mind of the bodhisattva sufficiently to motivate him to go forth. [37]
The Gha�īkāra-sutta and its parallels continue by relating that on one occasion Kassapa Buddha had come to Gha�īkāra’s house when the latter was out. [38] The potter’s
blind parents told Kassapa that he should help himself to the food that was ready in the
kitchen.
While the other versions simply indicate that Kassapa did so, the Madhyama-āgama
version and the Sanskrit and Tibetan Sa�ghabhedavastu further specify that he helped


35 [[SN1.50]] at SN I 35,6 (or [[SN2]] 50 at [[SN2]] I 75,3), a discourse that recurs in the Sa�yutta-nikāya collection
as [[SN2.24]] at SN I 60,4 (or SN [2] 105 at SN [2] I 137,16). The Chinese parallels are [[SA595]] at T II 159c3 and
SĀ [2] 189 at T II 442c26, which differ in as much as they speak of Nandīpāla, .

37 Basak 1965: 212,3, 214,9, 217,6, and 221,3, or Senart 1890: 150,16, 152,10, 154,7, and 156,18. This intervention by Nandīpāla recurs also in a Buddha-biography preserved in Chinese, the, T
184 at T III 466b18. Another Buddha-biography, the, T 189 at T III 629c17, T III
630a17, T III 630c27, and T III 631c13 attributes the manifestation of an old man, a sick man, a dead
man, and a monk to an unnamed deva from the Pure Abodes. According to the Buddhacarita 3:26, 3:40,
and 3:54 in Johnston 1936/1995a: 23, 25, and 27, the devas from the Pure Abodes were only responsible
for the first three manifestations, i.e., the old man, the sick man, and the dead man, while according to
the Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1977: 73,2, they were only responsible for conjuring the apparition of a
monk, cf. also T 1450 at T XXIV 113b18. 難提婆(羅)
38 The Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1978a: 27,5 and in D (1) ’dul ba, ga 7b7 or Q (1030) nge 7a6 reports
that Kāśyapa at first softly knocked on the bolt to announce his presence to the blind parents, thereby
causing them to initiate the conversation, whereas according to [[MN81]] at MN II 52,8 Kassapa directly 修行本起經
asked them where Gha�īkāra had gone. The Mahāvastu 過去現在因果經 in Basak 1963a: 424,12 or in Senart 1882a:
327,7 and the Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1978a: 27,3 note that Kāśyapa had come to the potter’s house
while undertaking the practice of going begging without interruption, sāvadāna� pi��āya caranto.
Childers 1875/1993: 461 s.v. sapadāna� calls into question the commentarial etymology at Vism 60,20
of the corresponding Pāli expression sapadāna as saha apadānena, “without interruption”, as does Senart 1882a: 595, who suggests the Sanskrit expression to point to sa + avadāna, “part by part”, in the
sense of “successively”. The corresponding passage in [[MA63]] at T I 502a13 speaks of begging food
“one after another” or “in turn”, . The implication of this practice is that a monk begs at each
house on the road he has taken, not leaving out any house because he anticipates that he might not receive food or only get low-quality alms.

himself to the food in accordance with the “custom of the northern Kurus”. [39] According to the Ā�ānā�iya-sutta, in the (mythical) region of northern Kuru private ownership
had been abolished, [40] a circumstance also recorded in the Divyāvadāna. [41] Thus the
“custom of the northern Kurus” might imply that in an ownerless society there would
be no need to offer food formally.
The Gha�īkāra-sutta and its parallels agree that when Gha�īkāra came home and
heard from his parents what had taken place, his joy lasted for two weeks. [42] The Majjhima-nikāya and Madhyama-āgama discourses report that Kassapa took food in Gha�īkāra’s house another time in the same manner, a description that differs from the previous occasion only in regard to the type of food he took. The Mahāvastu and the Sa�ghabhedavastu do not report such a second occasion.
It would indeed seem of little interest to repeat the whole episode just to show that
Kassapa Buddha at first had rice to go with the curries, while later he instead had porridge to go with the curries. [43] One might wonder if this passage in the Majjhima-nikāya
and Madhyama-āgama versions could be the outcome of a textual doubling of what
was originally only a single episode.
Notably, the Sa�ghabhedavastu follows its description of the Buddha’s visit to Gha�īkāra’s house by narrating how the parents gave a full account of the whole episode to
their son Gha�īkāra when he came home. [44] Thus in this version, the tale of the partaking of food also occurs twice, although these are two accounts of the same occasion. If
a similar repetition of the account of this episode should have been found in an early

39 [[MA63]] at T I 502a19 and again at T I 502b8:, to which the Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1978a:
27,14 refers to as “depending upon the conventions of Uttarakuru”, uttarakaurava� samayam adhi��hāya and D (1) ’dul ba, ga 8a3 or Q (1030) nge 7b1: byang gi sgra mi snyan gyi dus byin gyis brlabs nas.
This specification may be related to the fact that under normal circumstance it is reckoned improper for
a bhikkhu (and thus implicitly also for the Buddha) just to help himself to food; cf. the pācittiya rule 40
in Vin IV 90,1, and its parallels, pātayantika rule 39 in the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, T 1428 at T XXII
663c15, rule 39 in the Kāśyapīya Vinaya, T 1460 at T XXIV 662c18, rule 37 in the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya,

been offered to him. 鬱單曰法

he took “wheat and rice”,, and on the second occasion described at T I 502b7 he had “rice”,

version of the discourse, it could easily be imagined how a minor slip of memory in
regard to the type of food taken by Kassapa Buddha could have introduced a variation
that resulted in turning into two consecutive events what was originally only a single
event. If that should indeed have been the case, then this doubling took place at a relatively early stage of the transmission of the discourse, as it is found in the Majjhima-nikāya and the Madhyama-āgama versions.
The Gha�īkāra-sutta, its Madhyama-āgama parallel, and their counterparts in the Mahāvastu and the Sa�ghabhedavastu relate another occasion when Kassapa Buddha’s
hut was without roofing, which caused his monks to take some dry grass from the newly
made roof of Gha�īkāra’s workshop during the latter’s absence. [45] The Majjhima-nikāya
discourse, the Madhyama-āgama version, and the Sa�ghabhedavastu agree that even
though Gha�īkāra’s workshop remained without a roof for three months, for the whole
of this period it did not rain into it. [46]
According to the Madhyama-āgama discourse, the Mahāvastu, and the Sa�ghabhedavastu, Kassapa Buddha highlighted the contrast between Gha�īkāra, who was not at
all irritated when the newly made roofing of his working place had been removed or
when his meal had been eaten by someone else, and King Kiki, who was sorely displeased when Kassapa did not accept the invitation to spend the rainy season at Vārā�asī. [47] The Majjhima-nikāya discourse also contrasts the attitude of the king with that
of Gha�īkāra, although it does this at an earlier point, by way of introduction to its description of how Gha�īkāra reacted when his food and roofing had been taken away
during his absence. [48]
According to the Gha�īkāra-sutta and its parallels, the king dispatched cartloads of
food as a gift to Gha�īkāra, which Gha�īkāra politely refused to accept. The Gha�īkārasutta and its parallels agree that Gotama Buddha identified the Brahmin youth Jotipāla
as one of his former lives. [49] While the Majjhima-nikāya version concludes at this point,

45 A minor difference is that when the potter’s parents asked who was taking away the roof, according to
[[MN81]] at MN II 53,25 the monks replied by addressing both parents as “sister”, bhaginī. According to
[[MA63]] at T I 502b26, they used the address, “elders”.
46 [[MA63]]at T I 502c11 explains that this happened due to the power of Kassapa Buddha,, a
specification similarly made in the Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1978a: 29,5: buddhasya buddhānubhāvena and in D (1) ’dul ba, ga 9a6 or Q (1030) nge 8b4: sangs rgyas rnams kyi sangs rgyas kyi mthu, followed by also mentioning the power of the (rain) gods, devatānā� devatānubhāvena or else lha rnams

according to the Madhyama-āgama account the Buddha continued by highlighting that,
in contrast to his present life as a fully awakened Buddha, in his former life as Jotipāla
he had not been able to reach perfection. [50]
The Mahāvastu continues differently, as it narrates how the monk Jotipāla (Jyotipāla)
developed the aspiration to become a future Buddha. Through his telepathic powers, the
Buddha Kassapa (Kāśyapa) became aware of this and called Jotipāla to his presence, informing the young monk that he should first acquire merit by making offerings to the
Buddha and the monastic community. [51] Once Jotipāla had carried out this instruction,
Kassapa Buddha predicted that Jotipāla was destined to become a Buddha, a proclamation repeated by the gods of various celestial realms up to and including the Brahmā
world.
In this way, the Mahāvastu account presents the events described in the Gha�īkārasutta from the perspective of the bodhisattva’s career. This shift of emphasis finds its
explicit expression in the discourse’s title in the Mahāvastu, where the “discourse on
Gha�īkāra” has become the “discourse on Jyotipāla”. [52]
In the Gha�īkāra-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel, however, the circumstance
that Jotipāla was a former life of the Buddha does not seem to be the central point of
the tale. In fact, the Buddha’s former life as Jotipāla, unlike his former lives as Mahāsudassana and as Ma(k)hādeva, has not even made its way into the Pāli Jātaka collection. [53]
The central theme of the Gha�īkāra-sutta appears to be rather the contrast between
the potter Gha�īkāra and the king of Vārā�asī, in the sense that due to his virtues Gha�īkāra was a better supporter than the king of the country. Thus the didactic function of
the Gha�īkāra-sutta seems to be the depiction of an ideal layman, who fulfils his filial


dowed with u��ī�a and ūr�ā. The young Brahmin’s possession of these two out of the thirty-two characteristics is a clear indication of his impending Buddha-hood and thus confirms his status as a former life
of the Buddha Gotama, in fact his possession of thirty out of the thirty-two characteristics is explicitly
mentioned in T 197 at T IV 172c11. For another representation of the same event in a Gandhāran sculpture cf. Vogel 1954: 810.

and suggests the translation “basket”.
52 Basak 1963a: 436,5 or Senart 1882a: 335,8: jyotipāla-sūtra. The same would also be implicit in the placing of this episode within what, according to Hiraoka 2002/2003: 355, would have been the original
overall structural pattern of the Mahāvastu, in that the Jyotipāla-sūtra originally would have come directly after the accounts of previous predictions of Gautama’s future Buddhahood by the earlier Buddhas Dīpa�kara and Ma�gala, the intervening tales about the Buddha in Vaiśālī being a later addition;
cf. also Dutt 1956: 147-148.
53 This has already been noted by Oldenberg 1912b: 189. The counterparts to the former lives of the Bud- 不至究竟 ... 不離生老病死 ... 未能得脫一切苦
dha, depicted in [[DN17]] and [[MN83]] are the Mahāsudassana-jātaka, Jā 95 at Jā I 391-393, and the Makhādeva-jātaka, Jā 9 at Jā I 137-139. For a more detailed examination of the jātaka nature of the present
tale cf. Anālayo 2010f: 74-84.

duty by supporting his blind parents and at the same time lives a life that corresponds
as closely as possible to monastic standards. From the perspective of the Gha�īkārasutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel, such an ideal layman is superior even to the
king of the country.


[[MN82]] Ra��hapāla-sutta

The Ra��hapāla-sutta, the “discourse about Ra��hapāla”, records the going forth of
Ra��hapāla and his later visit to his parents as a monk. This discourse has three Chinese
parallels, one of which is found in the Madhyama-āgama, while the other two are individual translations. [54] Considerable parts of this discourse have also been preserved in
Sanskrit fragments. [55] A version of the present discourse can, moreover, be found in the
Bhai�ajyavastu of the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, preserved in Tibetan. [56]
Descriptions of Ra��hapāla’s going forth are also given in the Pāli and Sanskrit Apadāna/Avadāna collections and in their Chinese and Tibetan counterparts, [57] as well as in
a commentary on the beginning parts of the Ekottarika-āgama, preserved in Chinese. [58]


54 The parallels are [[MA132]] at T I 623a-628a, T 68 at T I 868c-872a, and T 69 at T I 872a-875a. According to the information given in the Taishō edition, T 68 was translated by Zhī Qīan ( ); on this attribution cf. also Nattier 2008: 129. T 69 was according to the information in the Taishō edition translated
by Făxián ( ). [[MA132]] T 68, and T 69 agree with [[MN82]] on locating the discourse in the Kuru country and entitling it after its protagonist Ra��hapāla. The same title recurs also in a reference to the present
discourse in the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Bhai�ajyavastu, T 1448 at T XXIV 37c1. [[MA132]] has been summarized and translated by Minh Chau 1964/1991: 66-69, 294-305. For counterparts to [[MN82]] at MN II

fragment), and the so far unpublished fragment no. 2376/37 of the Schøyen collection, identified by 支謙
Seishi Karashima (I am indebted to Jens-Uwe Hartmann for kindly providing me with a preliminary
draft transliteration of these fragments). SHT IV 412 contains considerable parts of the discourse and 法賢

and SHT V 1896 together with their Tibetan counterpart from the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Bhai�ajyavastu.
SHT XI 4568 corresponds to the beginning part of the discourse; SHT V 1896 parallels the request for
ordination and the parents’ reaction at MN II 56-57; SHT VI 1423 and Schøyen fragment 2376/37B
have a few words paralleling the verses at MN II 64-65; Schøyen fragment 2376/37A parallels the report given to the king at MN II 65; and SHT III 804 has a few words from the conclusion of the discourse
at MN II 74. For a comparison of some aspects of the diction found in the Sanskrit fragments and in the

452   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


MN II 54  The Ra��hapāla-sutta, its three Chinese parallels, and the Tibetan Bhai�ajyavastu describe how a group of householders came to visit the Buddha. [59]
The Majjhima-nikāya and Madhyama-āgama versions employ standard pericopes
found regularly in other discourses of the respective collections to describe several
variations in the behaviour that was adopted by the householders on approaching and
meeting the Buddha. As part of this standard description, they also mention that some
visitors just sat down silently. [60] The Pāli commentary on another occurrence of this description explains that those who remained silent did so out of hypocrisy or out of stupidity. [61]
According to the Madhyama-āgama description, in the present instance these householders sat down silently once they had “seen the Buddha from afar”, a detail not mentioned in the Pāli version of this pericope. [62]


at T XXIV 84b24-c6, with its Sanskrit and Tibetan counterparts in Hofinger 1954: 94-98; for the Sanskrit version cf. also Bechert 1961: 155-158, Dutt 1984a: 200-202, and Wille 1990: 100-101. The Mahāvastu in Basak 1968/2004: 25,2 or in Senart 1897: 41,1 also refers to Rā��rapāla, identifying him with
the protagonist of one of its jātaka accounts.
58 The, T 1507 at T XXV 42b17-c20; on this work cf. also Mori 1970.
59 In regard to the description of what motivated the householders to visit the Buddha, it is perhaps noteworthy that [[MA132]] at T I 623a22 qualifies the Dharma taught by the Buddha to “have meaning”,,
corresponding to [[MN82]] at MN II 55,9: sāttha� (while T 68 and the Tibetan Bhai�ajyavastu do not employ this pericope at all, T 69 at T I 872b1 speaks of “phrasing and meaning that are profound, genuine,
and not confused”, ). Bapat 1969: 3 explains the use of to point to a Prākrit
original used for the translation of the Madhyama-āgama, since if the translator “had a Sanskrit text as
his basic original, he would have naturally used an expression corresponding to Sanskrit svartha� (suartha�)”. The use of svartha can be found, for example, in a description of the Dharma taught by the
Buddha in fragment 493V2 of the Daśottara-sūtra in Mittal 1957: 27, and also in the same context in
the 分別功德論 Sa�ghabhedavastu’s parallel to the Sāmaññaphala-sutta in Gnoli 1978a: 230,15. Another variation
in regard to the description of what motivated the householders to visit the Buddha occurs in T 68 at T I
869a3 in relation to the Buddha’s qualities, as in this context this version also mentions the Buddha’s 有義
supernormal power, such as being able to fly through the air and to enter the earth.
60 [[MN82]] at MN II 55,20: “some kept silent and sat down at one side”, app’ ekacce tu�hībhūtā ekamanta�
nisīdi�su, and [[MA132]] at T I 623b 文義深遠純一無雜 1: “[some] sat down silently”, . The pericope employed in 有義
the Madhyama-āgama collection to describe such variations in behaviour of the visitors differs from its
Pāli counterpart in as much as the description that some visitors pronounced their name and then sat
down, cf., e.g., [[MN82]] at MN II 55,19: app’ ekacce bhagavato santike nāmagotta� sāvetvā ekamanta�
nisīdi�su, is without a counterpart, cf., e.g., [[MA16]] at T I 438c1, [[MA62]] at T I 497b27, [[MA64]] at T I
560c15, and [[MA161]] at T I 688a3 (in addition to the present instance in [[MA132]] at T I 623b1). However,
the same type of behaviour is taken into account in a Sanskrit version of this pericope in fragment 3v2 in
Hartmann 2002b: 4 (parallel to [[MN95]]): apy ekatyā bhagavata� sa�ntike svakasvakāni mātāpait�kāni
nāmagotrā�i anuśrāvayitvā ekatama�nte ni�īdi�su. The same detail can also be found in such a
description in the Divyāvadāna in Cowell 1886: 619,2: apy ekatyā bhagavata� purata� svakasvakāni
mātāpait�kā�i nāmagotrā�i anuśrāvyaikānte ni�annā� and in the Mahāvastu 默然而坐 in Basak 1968/2004: 266,6
or in Senart 1897: 443,20: apy ekatyā bhagavato svakasvakāni mātāpit�kāni nāmagotrā�i anuśrāvayitvā

The same additional specification recurs in versions of this pericope in the Catu�pari�at-sūtra and the Sa�ghabhedavastu. [63] From the perspective of these texts, it seems
that such visitors simply wish to witness the Buddha’s exposition from an uninvolved
distance. As they remain at a distance, it would only be natural that they do not pay respects or speak to the Buddha, an action that need not be interpreted as a sign of hypocrisy or stupidity.
Ra��hapāla was among the visiting householders and felt so inspired by the exposition delivered by the Buddha that he wished to go forth. One of the individual translations relates that, once the Buddha’s exposition was over and the visitors were leaving,
Ra��hapāla turned back and approached the Buddha again to express his desire to go
forth. [64] The Pāli commentary reports the same, explaining that in order to avoid interference by friends and relatives who had been present during the Buddha’s discourse,
Ra��hapāla had left together with them and then turned back on a pretext in order to approach the Buddha again and request ordination. [65] According to all versions, the Buddha told Ra��hapāla that, if he wished to go forth, he would need to get the consent of
his parents. [66]
The Sanskrit and Tibetan Avadāna tales differ from the presentation given in the discourse parallels and in the Tibetan Bhai�ajyavastu, as according to these tales Ra��hapāla’s inspiration to go forth arose on seeing that the Buddha was endowed with the
thirty-two characteristics of a superior being (mahāpurisa-lakkha�a), together with
their accompanying eighty minor characteristics. [67] Ra��hapāla had noticed these characteristics when he saw the Buddha begging alms in town, so that in the Sanskrit and


63 Catu�pari�at-sūtra fragment [[MN368]]V2 in Waldschmidt 1952: 46: (dūrād e)[va] d���vā tū��īm-ekānte
nya�īdan, its Chinese counterpart, T 1450 at T XXIV 135b27: “some remained at a distance and sat
down silently”,, and the Tibetan version in Waldschmidt 1962: 343,3: “some saw
the Blessed One from afar and silently sat down at one side” (my translation), kha cig ni bcom ldan ’das
rgyang ring po nas mthong nas cang mi smra bar phyogs gcig tu ’khod do; cf. also von Simson 1965:
89. The pericope used in the Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1977: 155,2 similarly reads eke bhagavanta�
dūrād eva d���vā tū��īm ekānte ni�a��ā�. A comparable description in the Mahāvastu in Basak 1968/
2004: 266,9 or in Senart 1897: 444,1, however, does not have this specification, just reading apy ekatyā
māgadhakā brāhma�a-g�hapatikā tū��ībhūtā ekānte ni�īdensu�, as is the case for an occurrence of such
a description in the Divyāvadāna in Cowell 1886: 619,5: apy ekatyās tū��ī�bhūtā ekānte ni�a��ā�.
64 T 68 at T I 869a22.
65 Ps III 291,1.
66 A reference to the Buddha’s refusal to ordain Rā��rapāla without the consent of his parents can also be 一分遠住默然而坐
found in the Karmavibha�ga in Kudo 2004: 118,1 and 119,1 or in Lévi 1932a: 59,8. According to Prasad
1972a: 104, getting the consent of one’s parents was also required for going forth in the Jain tradition.
67 Speyer 1909/1970: 118,11 or Vaidya 1958a: 227,11 and Devacandra 1996: 632,8. The same versions in
Speyer 1909/1970: 118,9 or in Vaidya 1958a: 227,9 and in Devacandra 1996: 632,3 agree with their
Chinese counterpart, T 200 at T IV 249b13, that the Buddha had come on purpose to convert Rā��rapāla.
According to the same tale in Speyer 1909/1970 124,17 or in Vaidya 1958a: 229,30 and in Devacandra
1996: 639,12, in a former life Rā��rapāla had also been inspired on seeing Kāśyapa Buddha endowed
with the thirty-two characteristics. This perhaps helps to explain why in the present Avadāna tale the
mere sight of Gautama Buddha endowed with the thirty-two characteristics had such an impact on him.



MN II 55


454   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


Tibetan Avadāna accounts Ra��hapāla conceived the wish to go forth without even
having heard an exposition of the Dharma.
The Chinese Avadāna account, however, agrees with the discourse parallels and the
Tibetan Bhai�ajyavastu in as much as it records the Buddha delivering some teachings
to Ra��hapāla. [68] The same Chinese Avadāna account also reports the impact of the Buddha’s thirty-two major and eighty minor characteristics on Ra��hapāla, although in its
account this only appears to have inspired Ra��hapāla to approach and listen to the Buddha. [69]

MN II 57  The Ra��hapāla-sutta and its parallels relate that Ra��hapāla went on a hunger strike,
because his parents had refused to allow him to become a monk. One of the individual
translations offers additional background to this refusal, mentioning that before his
birth Ra��hapāla’s parents had longed to have a son who would ensure continuity to
their family line. [70]
This ties in with a passage in a Dīgha-nikāya discourse, according to which the duties of a son are to continue the family line, to look after his parents when they are old,
to maintain the inheritance, and to give offerings for the benefit of the departed ancestors. [71]


68 T 200 at T IV 249b21, according to which the Buddha delivered teachings on the four (noble) truths on
this occasion, . The fact that T 200 refers to teachings given by the Buddha is of interest in the
light of the suggestion by Bagchi 1945: 57 and Pachow 1953: 2 that this version of the Avadānaśataka
collection preserved in Chinese translation is earlier than the Sanskrit version at our disposal, the latter
containing several later interpolations and amplifications not yet found in the version that was translated
into Chinese. The situation appears to be, however, somewhat complex, as can be seen in the detailed
comparative study of two Avadānaśataka tales in Meisig 2004. The same also becomes evident in the
present case, as T 200 at T IV 249b15 describes various miracles that took place when the Buddha entered town, such as an earthquake, a rain of heavenly flowers, a great light, the blind could see, the deaf
hear, the mute speak, and the lame walk. These miracles are not found in the Sanskrit and Tibetan versions. In this case, the Chinese Avadāna version might be showing signs of later amplification, since a
general tendency in Buddhist texts appears to be to add miracles rather than leaving them out. A similar 四諦法
description of various miracles that happened when Kāśyapa Buddha once entered a town can be found
in the Mahāvastu in Basak 1963a: 396,2 or in Senart 1882a: 308,1. According to the same Mahāvastu in
Basak 1968/2004: 153,18 or in Senart 1897: 255,17, such miraculous events are regularly part of the
Buddha’s entry into a city. For another description of the wonders that accompany the Buddha’s arrival
in a city cf., e.g., the Divyāvadāna in Cowell 1886: 365,2 or Vaidya 1999: 229,16.

1950 (Strong 1983a: 173 comments that the substantial number of Chinese translations of this discourse
reflects its common use “by Buddhists in China to show their religion’s support for Confucian filiality”);
cf. also [[AN10.23]] at AN III 43,14, which lists five expectations parents have in regard to their son. The
same duties recur among a listing of the benefits that parents expect from a son in the Karmavibha�ga in
Kudo 2004: 118,8 and 119,8 or in Lévi 1932a: 59,12; cf. also the Divyāvadāna in Cowell 1886: 2,15 or in
Vaidya 1999: 1,22. Cohen 2000: 13 explains that “a son is so valued ... because his behaviors as a son
are crucial to the well being of fathers and forefathers”; cf. also Bareau 1976: 19. For a description of
the parents’ affliction at their son’s wish to go forth in Jain texts cf. the Antaga�adasāo, translated in


Chapter 9 Rāja-vagga                                        -  455


In view of this set of duties, if Ra��hapāla as the only son of the household would go
forth, this would not only deprive his parents of the company of their beloved son, but
would also threaten to bring the family lineage to an end and cause the loss of the family’s inheritance. Moreover, there would be no son to make offerings on behalf of the
parents once they had passed away, an important requirement for their well-being after
death according to ancient Indian beliefs. These repercussions of Ra��hapāla’s going
forth would have been at the background of his parents’ wish to prevent him from ordaining.
According to the Chinese Avadāna account, Ra��hapāla had already become a streamenterer during his first meeting with the Buddha. [72] Although the Pāli and Chinese discourse versions do not explicitly mention any attainment, their account also suggests
that the Buddha’s sermon had left a strong impression on Ra��hapāla, as he was so determined to go forth that he went on a prolonged hunger strike in order to get his parents’ approval. [73]
Although his parents, relatives, and friends tried to persuade him to give up his fast,
Ra��hapāla remained firm in his decision. [74] Faced with the prospect that their son might

72 T 200 at T IV 249b22, which happened when the Buddha had expounded the four noble truths to him.
73 According to the Avadānaśataka in Speyer 1909/1970 119,8, Rā��rapāla was so determined to go forth
that he abstained from food for six meals, yāvac cha� bhaktacchedā� k�tā� (Vaidya 1958a: 227,22: yavat �a�), cf. also SHT V 1896R5: [yā]va[t]-�a[�-a]pi. [[MN66]] at MN I 448,5 and its parallel [[MA192]] at
T I 741a14+20 indicate that it was customary in ancient India to take three meals per day, so that to forgo six meals would imply that Ra��hapāla’s fast continued for a period of about two days. According to
the Burmese and Siamese editions of [[MN82]] his fast lasted for seven meals, B [e] -MN II 247,18 and S [e]  MN II 392,8: satta pi bhattāni na bhuñji, while E [e] and C [e] do not specify the time period (cf. also the
parallel account of the going forth of Sudinna at Vin III 13,21, which records that Sudinna abstained
from seven meals). The Sanskrit fragment in Waldschmidt 1980b: 366 also reports that he fasted for
seven meals, yāvat sapta bhaktacchedānām akār�īt. According to [[MA132]] at T I 623c11, however, Ra��hapāla fasted for “over four days”, (a fast earlier specified to also imply abstention from
drinking), and according to T 68 at T I 869b13 he fasted up to five days, (here, too, including
abstention from drinking), while T 69 does not specify the time period. The Bhai�ajyavastu in Hofinger
1954: 96 notes that he fasted for six days, �a�rātra�, a time period also mentioned in T 199 at T IV
196c1:, in T 200 at T IV 249b28:, in T 1507 at T XXV 42b26:, and in the Tibetan Avadānaśataka in Devacandra 1996: 633,5: zhag gcig dang ... drug gi bar du kha ’tshos so. The Tibetan
Bhai�ajyavastu at D (1) ’dul ba, kha 102a1 or Q (1030) ge 94a6 (or Matsumura 1985: 45,1) records that
he fasted for up to seven days, nyi ma gcig ... bdun gyi bar du zan bcad pa byas so, a time period also
mentioned in B [e] -Ap-[[AN328]] sattāha� bhattaccheda� katvā. The same is implicit in Jā I 156,13, which
speaks of another young man who, “just like the elder Ra��hapāla”, ra��hapālathero viya, fasted for

pāla’s determination to become a monk appears to have been enhanced by progressive extensions of the
period of his fast as a way of throwing into relief his strong determination. On the threat to starve oneself to death 六日 as a means to achieve an objective 六日 in the ancient Indian context 六日 in general cf. Hopkins 1900.

starve himself to death, Ra��hapāla’s parents finally allowed him to go forth under the
condition that he should come to visit them, a permission given in the hope that he would
become dissatisfied with the life of a monk and return to live with them. [75]

MN II 60  Ra��hapāla ordained, [76] and after practising earnestly in due time became an arahant. [77]
According to the commentary on the Ekottarika-āgama, Ra��hapāla had become an arahant after being taught the four noble truths, [78] while according to the Sanskrit and Tibetan Avadānaśataka tales he accomplished the same by developing insight into the
impermanent nature of all formations. [79]

MN II 61  With the Buddha’s permission, Ra��hapāla went to visit his family. Begging his food
in successive order from house to house, Ra��hapāla approached his parents’ place. On
seeing Ra��hapāla from afar, Ra��hapāla’s father did not recognize his own son and
voiced his displeasure at seeing one of those “bald-headed recluses” that had taken his
only son away from him. [80] The Madhyama-āgama account adds that the father right

1970: 120,1 or in Vaidya 1958a: 228,2, and the Tibetan Avadānaśataka in Devacandra 1996: 633,19. T
69 at T I 872c9 does not mention that either the friends or the relatives attempted to convince Ra��hapāla
to stop fasting, only reporting that Ra��hapāla’s friends counselled his parents to allow him to go forth.
75 Notably, the description of Ra��hapāla’s hunger strike to obtain his parents’ permission to go forth and
his later visit to them as a monk recurs in almost the same terms in the Vinaya account of the going forth
of the monk Sudinna in Vin III 11-17, cf. also Jā 14 at Jā I 156,11, a parallelism already noted by Lupton 1894: 770. Von Hinüber 1976: 37 (cf. also id. 1996/1997: 13) considers the Sudinna tale to be the
earlier version of the two stories, because of the form vihe�hayittha found in Vin III 17,28, in contrast to
the form vihe�hetha in [[MN82]] at MN II 64,17. According to Lupton 1894: 771, however, the tale of “Sudinna ... evolved as the correlative of Ra��hapāla”; cf. also below note 123. For a study of different
versions of the Sudinna tale cf. Anālayo 2012a.
76 According to T 68 at T I 869c13, the Buddha had already left for Sāvatthī while Ra��hapāla was on hunger strike, so that, to get ordained, Ra��hapāla had to go all the way to Sāvatthī to meet the Buddha there.
77 The Therāpadāna at Ap I 64,4 and the Chinese Avadāna version in T 200 at T IV 249c5 record that Ra��hapāla attained the six abhiññās; cf. also T 68 at T I 869c23.

at arahant-ship in Avadānaśataka tales, so that its occurrence in the present instance is a case of applying a pericope and need not be characteristic of the individual person concerned. The same pericope recurs in the Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1977: 177,10 in a different context.

T 69 at T I 873a9 does not report the episode with the father at all, but proceeds directly from Ra��hapāla’s setting out to beg alms to the next episode, concerned with his meeting
with a female slave that was about to throw away stale food.

away gave orders that no food should be given, [81] a reaction which caused Ra��hapāla to
leave quickly. [82] One of the individual translations offers the additional information that
the whole family felt hostile towards monks, to the extent that they would avoid even
looking at them. [83]
The Ra��hapāla-sutta and its parallels describe how Ra��hapāla asked a female slave
of his parents’ household, who was about to throw away stale food, to give the food to
him instead. The Madhyama-āgama version and one of the individual translations note
that the food was already smelly. [84] The commentary on the Pāli Vinaya reckons Ra��hapāla’s partaking of food in a condition that it was to be thrown away as an example of
supreme contentedness. [85]
The Ra��hapāla-sutta and its parallels relate that when coming close to Ra��hapāla to
give him the food, the female slave recognized him. [86] According to the Majjhima-nikāya account and one of the individual translations, she reported her discovery to Ra��hapāla’s mother, who was so delighted as to promise to set her free from slavery. [87]
The Madhyama-āgama version, the other individual translation, and the Tibetan Bhai�ajyavastu account instead report that the female slave informed the father of her discovery. [88]
The Ra��hapāla-sutta and its parallels agree in recording that Ra��hapāla’s father approached his son, asking him to come and take food at his parent’s house. The Pāli Vinaya has preserved a verse exchange between Ra��hapāla and his father that seems to
pertain to the present turn of events, although these verses are not found in any of the

identity. Regarding the reference to a female domestic slave in the different versions, according to Tha- 臭
[[BU-PJ1975]] 121 domestic slaves were “the more common category [of slaves] met with in the Indian sources
... slaves were probably expensive ... and could not therefore be used too extensively in production”; on
slaves in ancient India cf. also, e.g., Auboyer 1961: 52-56.

different versions of the present discourse. According to this verse exchange, the father
asks Ra��hapāla why he did not come to beg from his father, to which Ra��hapāla replies that begging is not pleasing to others, just as for one who begs it is not pleasing
when he receives nothing – an evident reference to the events that according to the Ra��hapāla-sutta and its parallels had just taken place. [89]
It is noteworthy that the Ra��hapāla-sutta, in spite of giving such a detailed account
of events, has not included this exchange between father and son in its account, even
though according to the Vinaya passage the Buddha explicitly attributed this stanza to
Ra��hapāla, an identification that is, moreover, evident from the use of Ra��hapāla’s
name in the father’s stanza.
This is just one of several examples where even texts belonging to the same Theravāda tradition have not been thoroughly homogenized. From a general perspective, this
shows that it is rather improbable that instances where they agree should be entirely
due to a later levelling of texts.

MN II 63  Returning to the comparative study of the Ra��hapāla-sutta, the Madhyama-āgama
discourse and one of the individual translations report that Ra��hapāla went straight
away to the house with his father, [90] whereas according to the Majjhima-nikāya version
and the other individual translation he only came the next day. [91]
The Pāli and Chinese discourses and the Tibetan Bhai�ajyavastu account report that
when Ra��hapāla came for the meal, his parents tried to make him give up the life of a
monk by offering him wealth. [92] In reply, he told them to better throw their riches into
the river Ganges in order to avoid the sorrow and anguish that would inevitably result
from owning wealth. The two individual translations further explain this remark by
mentioning the suffering that arises due to the fear of losing one’s wealth to kings, robbers, or natural calamities. [93] The Pāli commentary offers a similar explanation. [94]


89 Vin III 148,32: yācako appiyo hoti, yāca� adadam appiyo. Oldenberg 1912b: 187 note 1 draws attention to a similar verse exchange found in Jā 403 at Jā III 353,6 and in the Mahāvastu in Basak 1968/
2004: 251,7 or in Senart 1897: 419,7, attributed to a former existence of the bodhisattva under the name
of A��hisena or Asthisena (a comparative study of the Jātaka and Mahāvastu versions of these stanzas
can be found in Schneider 1953).
90 [[MA132]] at T I 624c28 and T 69 at T I 873a24.
91 [[MN82]] at MN II 63,14 and T 68 at T I 870a26. T 1507 at T XXV 42c6 also records that Ra��hapāla refused to accept food the same day and only came the next day, which according to its account he did because the proper time for partaking of food had already passed.
92 While according to [[MN82]] at MN II 63,21 it was the father who made this offer, the Chinese and Tibetan versions attribute this device to the mother, cf. [[MA123]] at T I 625a8, T 68 at T I 870b5, T 69 at T
I 873b1, and D (1) ’dul ba, kha 104b2 or Q (1030) ge 96b1; on the expression used in [[MN82]] to describe
the gold etc., offered on this occasion, cf. Rhys Davids 1877: 5.
93 T 68 at T I 870b14 and T 69 at T I 873b7. Regarding the reference to kings as a potential threat to one’s
wealth, Gokhale 1966: 16 notes that in early Buddhist scripture “kings are always greedy ... always searching for pretexts allowing them to acquire more wealth or territory”. That kings can be a threat to one’s
property is also recognized in the Jain tradition, cf., e.g., the Āyāra�ga 1.2.3.5 in Schubring 1910/1966:
9,5: rāyā�o vā se vilumpanti (Jacobi 1882: 9,25 reads vilu�pa�ti).
94 Ps III 300,6.

After this ruse proved unsuccessful, Ra��hapāla’s former wives entered the scene, [95] MN II 64
tantalizingly asking him whether he had undertaken the life of a monk for the sake of
winning heavenly nymphs. The Pāli and Chinese discourses, the Sanskrit fragment,
and the Tibetan Bhai�ajyavastu version agree that Ra��hapāla reacted by calling them
“sisters”, indicating through this form of address that he was beyond any interest in
their female charms. [96] While according to the Majjhima-nikāya version, the two individual translations, and the Tibetan Bhai�ajyavastu account he merely made it clear
that he did not practise for the sake of nymphs, according to the Madhyama-āgama
version he further explained that the objective for which he had undertaken the life of a
monk had been fully accomplished by him. [97]
Having partaken of the meal offered by his parents, according to the Madhyama-āgama version, one of the individual translations, and the Tibetan Bhai�ajyavastu account
Ra��hapāla delivered a discourse and thereby satisfied and pleased his parents. [98] At the
conclusion of this discourse he spoke a set of stanzas, in which he contrasted a fool deluded by female charms with someone who is in search of the other shore. [99] The Majjhima-nikāya discourse records a similar set of stanzas spoken by Ra��hapāla, a set of
stanzas also found in the Theragāthā. [100]


95 From the different versions itself it is not clear how far, given the apparently young age when Ra��hapāla went forth, the existence of these former wives could be reflecting child marriage. The existence
of child marriage suggests itself from a passage in Vin IV 322,6 (pācittiya rule 65 of the Bhikkhunīvibha�ga), which refers to a married girl whose age is less than twelve years (in her detailed examination
of this passage, Kieffer-Pülz 2005a: 235 concludes that the twelve years probably stand for the age of
the girl, not for the time she has been married; for a reply to her presentation cf. von Hinüber 2008).
The same appears to be implicit also in [[SN37.3]] at SN IV 239,13, according to which one of the disadvantages of being a woman is to be separated at a tender age from one’s own family and to have to go
and live in the family of one’s husband; cf. also Horner 1930/1990: 27, Misra 1972: 179, and Talim
1972: 163.
96 [[MN82]] at MN II 64,12: bhagini (Be-MN II 252,21 and Ce-MN II 434,4: bhaginī), [[MA132]] at T I 625b9:
, T 68 at T I 870b25:, T 69 at T I 873b17:, Waldschmidt 1980b: 374: bhaginya�, and the Tibetan counterpart in D (1) ’dul ba, kha 105a7 or Q (1030) ge 97a6 (or Matsumura 1985: 55,2): sring
mo. The implications of considering a woman to be one’s sister can be seen in [[SN35.127]] at SN IV
110,31, where young monks are instructed to look on women as their sisters (or else as mothers or
daughters) in order to avoid the arising of sensual desire. The use of the address “sister” by Ra��hapāla
has a counterpart in the Chinese and Tibetan parallels to the Mahāsudassana-sutta, where the king in a
similar way indicates his disinterested attitude towards his queen by addressing her as “sister”, cf. T
1451 at T XXIV 394a18:, with its counterpart sring mo in Waldschmidt 1951: 345 (cf. also the corresponding fragment [[SN360]] folio 222V3 in Waldschmidt 1950: 38). In the Pāli version, [[DN17]] at DN
II 192,12, however, the king used the term devī, a normal way for a king to address his queen.

same context at Th 775 is, however, without a parallel in the Ra��hapāla-sutta or in its Chinese counterparts. Ra��hapāla’s stanza Th 769 recurs in [[DHP|DHP147]] his stanzas Th 769-770 and Th 772 have parallels

According to the Chinese versions and the Tibetan Bhai�ajyavastu account, Ra��hapāla departed by flying up in the air. [101] One of the individual translations explains that
he did so because his parents had locked the door to prevent him from leaving after the
meal. [102]

MN II 65  The Ra��hapāla-sutta and its parallels continue by relating that, after leaving the house
of his parents, Ra��hapāla went to the royal park. On being informed of Ra��hapāla’s
presence in the royal park, the local king came to pay him a visit.
Although the ensuing discussion between Ra��hapāla and the king may at first sight
appear to form an epilogue to the narration of Ra��hapāla’s going forth and visit home,
the Majjhima-nikāya collection nevertheless allocates the Ra��hapāla-sutta to its chapter on kings. [103] As the discourse does not present Ra��hapāla as being either a king or a
member of the king’s family, [104] the reason for including this discourse in the chapter on


in the Sanskrit and Tibetan Udāna-(varga) stanzas 27:20-21 and 27:23 in Bernhard 1965: 341-344 (cf.
also stanzas 381-382 in Nakatani 1987: 78) and in Beckh 1911: 94-95 or in Zongtse 1990: 279-280. On
the description of the deceptive nature of women’s bodies in these stanzas cf., e.g., Lang 1986: 71.
101 [[MA132]] at T I 625c3, T 68 at T I 870c14, T 69 at T I 873b24, and D (1) ’dul ba, kha 105b7 or Q (1030)
ge 97b5.
102 T 68 at T I 870c1. Ps III 304,4 similarly narrates that Ra��hapāla departed by flying up in the air, explaining that his father had planned to remove Ra��hapāla’s robes forcefully and clothe him in white.
Although in ancient India the status of a wandering monk was perhaps not what the parents of a rich
and important household would have wished for their only son, it seems difficult to conceive of them
trying to forcefully remove his robes and dress him in white. Vin I 73-76 reports that to become a Buddhist monk was a way for soldiers to escape from having to go to war and for robbers to avoid being
charged for their crime, it even saved slaves from being taken back by their owners. In view of such degree of immunity, there would seem to be little scope for Ra��hapāla’s parents to be depicted as trying
to force their adult son to comply with their wishes.
103 While [[MN82]] occurs in the Rāja-vagga, [[MA132]] occurs in the “great chapter”,, of the Madhyama-āgama.
104 According to the Sanskrit and Tibetan Avadāna account, however, Rā��rapāla was the son of the king’s
brother, cf. Speyer 1909/1970: 118,9 or Vaidya 1958a: 227,9 and Devacandra 1996: 632,1, and according to the Chinese Avadāna account, T 200 at T IV 249b27, he was even the crown prince. Feer 1891:
363 remarks that Ra��hapāla’s name, whose meaning is “protector of the country”, supports the assumption that he was a member of the royal family (“cette naissance royale ... est, du reste, comme indiquée par le nom même du héros”). Yet, in the majority of sources Ra��hapāla does not seem to have
royal status, as becomes particularly evident from the remainder of the description of the conversation
between the local king and Ra��hapāla in the Pāli and Chinese discourses and the Tibetan Bhai�ajyavastu. The Sanskrit Avadāna tale no. 84 in Speyer 1909/1970: 80,15 or in Vaidya 1958a: 209, 大品 30, and its
Chinese and Tibetan counterparts, T 200 at T IV 246a19 and Devacandra 1996: 584,2, relate that at the
time of Buddha Kāśyapa the crown prince of Vārā�asī also obtained permission to go forth by going on
a hunger strike, just as Rā��rapāla did. According to Sanskrit Avadāna tale no. 90 in Speyer 1909/1970:
125,4 or in Vaidya 1958a: 230,5 and its Tibetan counterpart in Devacandra 1996: 639,7, at the time of
Kāśyapa Buddha, Rā��rapāla had also been a son of the same king of Vārā�asī, presumably a brother of
the crown prince mentioned in tale no. 84. Perhaps a confusion between these stories caused the attribution of royal status to Rā��rapāla also in his present life account. T 200 at T IV 249c24 even reports
that at that time Ra��hapāla was the king himself. Demoto 1998: 119-123 (page reference and résumé
provided to me by the author) explains that the Chinese translation has preserved an earlier version of


Chapter 9 Rāja-vagga                                        -  461


kings would be the appearance of the local king during this final part of the discourse.
This indicates that, from the perspective of the reciters, this section constitutes the discourse proper, so to say, to which the earlier narration of Ra��hapāla’s going forth and
subsequent visit home serves as an introductory narration.
In regard to the king’s visit, the Pāli, Chinese, and Tibetan versions differ in their
portrayal of the degree of respect shown by the king towards Ra��hapāla. [105] According
to the Majjhima-nikāya account, the king politely invited Ra��hapāla to sit on what apparently was the king’s own sitting rug, and only once Ra��hapāla had declined to use
this rug the king sat down on it himself. [106] The Chinese versions do not mention such a
rug at all. According to the Madhyama-āgama discourse, however, the king made a
point of waiting until he was invited to sit down. [107] One of the individual translations
reports that he paid his respect and then simply sat down, without any explicit invitation, [108] while according to the other individual translation Ra��hapāla, on seeing the king
approach, quickly got up himself, went forward, and invited the king to come and sit
down with him. [109] These minor differences (see further below table 9.3) give a different flavour to the ensuing meeting.
According to the Madhyama-āgama version, one of the individual translation, and
the Tibetan Bhai�ajyavastu account, the king offered some of his wealth to Ra��hapāla. [110] Ra��hapāla declined, indicating that a more proper offer the king could make to
him would be to ensure that the country was peaceful and prosperous.
The Ra��hapāla-sutta and its parallels agree that the king thought the motivation for
someone to go forth could be:

  - old age,

  - disease,


the Avadāna tale, which in the Sanskrit and Tibetan versions has been expanded by absorption of discourse material. This caused a conflict between Rā��rapāla as a crown prince in the original Avadāna
account and Rā��rapāla as a kulaputta or g�hapatiputra in the discourse, a conflict that was resolved by
treating him as the bhrāt�putra, as the son of the king’s brother.
105 Another difference is that according to [[MN82]] at MN II 65,11 and T 68 at T I 870c18 the king originally intended to come to the park for recreation, while according to [[MA132]] at T I 625c9 his original
intention was to hunt.
106 Ee-MN II 66,4, Be-MN II 254,7, and Ce-MN II 436,18 report that the king offered Ra��hapāla his “elephant rug”, hatthatthara, to sit down. Ps III 305,6 explains that he did so because he felt it improper to
just sit on this rug himself, without first inviting Ra��hapāla to sit on it. An elephant rug occurs in a list
of unsuitable seats not used by the Buddha in [[DN1]] at DN I 7,10. According to Vin I 192,17, the possession of elephant rugs was prohibited to monks, although according to Vin II 163,24 monks were allowed just to sit on an elephant rug if invited to do so by laity. Instead of an elephant rug, S [e] -MN II
402,10 speaks of a “mat made of twigs”, ka��hatthara.
107 [[MA132]] at T I 625c29; cf. also the similar report in D (1) ’dul ba, kha 106b4 or Q (1030) ge 98b1. For a
comparable behaviour in the case of a Brahmin who visits a monk cf. [[MN94]] at MN II 158,16.
108 T 68 at T I 870c23.
109 T 69 at T I 873c12. This would be rather unusual behaviour for a monk, who is not supposed to rise at
the arrival of any layperson, even a king.

The parallel versions differ from each other in the sequence in which they list these
four themes (see table 9.1).
On considering these possible motivations, the king was puzzled to find that Ra��hapāla, who was young and healthy, from a wealthy family, and with many friends and
relatives, had nevertheless gone forth. [112]

The Ra��hapāla-sutta and its Chinese and Tibetan parallels differ to some extent on
the reasoning the king attributed to these four types of motivation. According to the
Majjhima-nikāya account, in all four instances the rationale for going forth is that the
person in question feels no longer able to acquire wealth or else to increase the wealth
that has already been acquired. [113] The Madhyama-āgama version and the Tibetan
Bhai�ajyavastu account, however, do not mention the problem of acquiring or increasing wealth. [114] One of the individual translations envisages this problem only for the


111 Schmidt-Leukel 1984: 69 notes that the king sees old age, disease, etc., as causes for searching material
security, not as something that can inspire a radical change of one’s attitude to life. On early Buddhist
attitudes to poverty cf. also Fenn 1996. Schopen 2010: 127 notes that in the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, however, old age, poverty, and loss of relatives regularly motivate going forth as a Buddhist monk
(cf. also below note 117). The present case could perhaps serve as a reminder that conclusions based on
a reading of the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya are not necessarily representative of what early Buddhist
texts have to say on a particular issue.
112 The same motif recurs in the Mahāvastu in Basak 1965: 227,15 or in Senart 1890: 161,15, which notes
that the bodhisattva also did not go forth because of old age, disease, loss of wealth, or loss of relatives.
113 [[MN82]] at MN II 66,17+31 and MN II 67,16+32: “it is not easy for me to acquire riches that have not [yet]
been acquired, or to increase riches that have been acquired”, na kho pana mayā sukara� anadhigatā
vā bhogā adhigantu�, adhigatā vā bhogā phāti� kātu� (B [e] -MN II 254,18, C [e] -MN II 436,28, and S [e]  MN II 403,4: (an)adhigata� vā bhoga�). This explanation does not fit each of the four cases equally
well. Someone who is poor may indeed find it difficult to acquire riches, but a poor person would not
really have a problem concerning the increase of riches that have already been acquired, as the very
condition of being poor implies that there are no acquired riches in the first place.
114 According to [[MA132]] at T I 626a25 and T I 626b2 and according to the Tibetan Bhai�ajyavastu at D (1)
’dul ba, kha 107a7 and 107b6 or Q (1030) ge 99a3 and 99b1, sick or old persons realize that they are
anyway no longer able to enjoy sensual pleasures and thus decide to go forth. In the case of loss of
relatives or lack of wealth, [[MA132]] at T I 626b6+11 and the Tibetan Bhai�ajyavastu at D (1) ’dul ba,
kha 108a4 and 108b1 or Q (1030) ge 99b6 and 100a2 do not mention any explicit motivation for going
forth, apparently taking the reasons to be self-evident.


Chapter 9 Rāja-vagga                                        -  463


case of old age, [115] while the other individual translation relates the problem of acquiring and protecting wealth to the case of being old, being ill, or being without relatives. [116] The same version, however, makes a point of not bringing in the need to protect wealth in its examination of the case when someone is poor. Instead, this individual translation indicates that someone who is poor and has difficulties earning his livelihood will go forth in order to support himself by begging. [117]
In reply to the four motives proposed by the king, Ra��hapāla explained that his reasons for going forth had been:

  - the changing nature of the world,

  - the absence of any real shelter in it,

  - the fact that all has to be left behind at death,

  - the insatiability of craving.
These four motives are presented in the parallel versions in different sequences (see
below table 9.2). The parallel versions agree, however, that Ra��hapāla presented these
four reasons only in a succinct manner, which caused the king to request a more detailed exposition. Ra��hapāla did so by skilfully adjusting his explanations to the king’s
personal experience, drawing the king’s awareness to the fact that:

  - his physical condition had changed with the coming of old age and he was no
longer as strong as he had been in his youth,

  - nobody could protect him from the suffering of sickness,

  - when passing away, he will have to leave behind all his possessions,

  - being a king he will never be satisfied with his dominion, always ready to conquer additional territory. [118]
Ra��hapāla then summed up his exposition in verse form. [119] The Majjhima-nikāya discourse concludes with the last of Ra��hapāla’s verses. [120] The Madhyama-āgama version,


115 T 69 at T I 874a6. The same version reckons loneliness due to loss of relatives, the suffering of having
an incurable disease, and the suffering of poverty to be reasons for going forth.
116 T 68 at T I 871a9+14+17.
117 T 68 at T I 871a20. In fact, although monks were not always sure to get their fill, to become a monk appears to have been a way of accessing a relatively stable supply of food and other minimal necessities.
This seems to have been the case to such an extent that, according to Vin IV 129,10, parents decided to
get their children ordained in order to ensure that they will not lack food, since Buddhist monks, after
“having eaten good food lie down on beds sheltered from the wind”, subhojanāni bhuñjitvā nivātesu
sayanesu sayanti (for other instances that testify to relatively profane motivations for going forth cf.
Brekke 1996: 9-10). According to Vin IV 91,20, on another occasion an ascetic even made fun of the
Buddhist monk community for their abundant supplies, derisively calling the Buddha a “shaven headed
householder”, mu��agahapati; for a study of Jain texts that mock the abundant food partaken off by
Buddhist monks cf. Granoff 1998.
118 The theme of protection, in that even a king is not able to protect himself against disease, is also employed by a Jain monk in discussion with King Bimbisāra in Uttarājjhaya�[[AN20.12]] in Charpentier
1922: 153,19.
119 While [[MN82]] at MN II 72,26 (= Th 776-788, cf. also [[SNP50]]), [[MA132]] at T I 627c14, T 69 at T I 874c8,
and the Tibetan Bhai�ajyavastu at D (1) ’dul ba, kha 111b2 or Q (1030) ge 102b5 record this in verse
form, T 68 at T I 871c17 has the same in prose, cf. also above note 99. According to Zürcher 1991: 283,

a Sanskrit fragment, and the Tibetan Bhai�ajyavastu account additionally report that
the king was pleased, [121] according to one of the individual translations he took refuge,
and according to the other individual translation he became a stream-enterer. [122] The
king’s reaction depicted in the different versions thus stands in direct contrast to how
the different versions portray his initial behaviour towards Ra��hapāla.


Table 9.2: Themes of Ra��hapāla’s Reply in [[MN82]] and its Parallels

Whereas in the Majjhima-nikāya version the king acted in a very respectful manner,
yet the discourse ends without even going so far as to record that the king expressed his
appreciation, the individual translations show him behaving without any particular expression of respect, yet according to them he took refuge or even became a stream-enterer. By in this way providing a sharper contrast between the king’s attitudes before
receiving instructions and afterwards, these versions enhance Ra��hapāla’s abilities as
an eloquent teacher (see below table 9.3).
In addition to being an eloquent teacher, according to the A�guttara-nikāya’s list of
eminent disciples Ra��hapāla was outstanding among the Buddha’s disciples in respect
to going forth out of faith. [123] Sanskrit and Tibetan Avadāna sources, however, reckon
him to have been foremost among forest dwellers. [124]

it was common among early Chinese translators active during the second century AD to render verse as
prose, so that perhaps Zhī Qīan ( ) may have decided to render in prose what in his Indic original
was in verse.

the above-mentioned hypothesis by Lupton 1894: 771 (cf. above p. 456 note 75) that the Sudinna tale
drew on elements found originally in the story of Ra��hapāla, since if at the time of the coming into
being of the listing of eminent disciples in the A�guttara-nikāya the Sudinna tale in the Vinaya had
already taken its present shape, he 支謙 would have been associated with the same faithful determination to
go forth at all cost as Ra��hapāla, making it less probable that Ra��hapāla could be reckoned as foremost
in this respect. B [e] -Ap-[[AN327]] reports that already in a previous life Ra��hapāla had received a prediction
by Padumuttara Buddha that he would become “foremost among those gone forth out of faith”, saddhāpabbajitāna� aggo. According to the list of eminent disciples in the Ekottarika-āgama, Ra��hapāla was
rather outstanding among those who had gone forth from a noble and wealthy family, [[EA4.2]] at T II

Although Ra��hapāla would quite probably have spent a considerable part of his
monk’s life in the forest, to dwell in the forest appears to have been a fairly common
practice among the early generation of monks. [125] Thus in order to be reckoned an outstanding forest dweller, he would have to have lived an exceptionally secluded life
style. According to at least one of the individual translations, however, Ra��hapāla had
closely followed the Buddha after his ordination, which implies that he did not live exclusively in the forest. [126]

Whatever may be the last word on the quality in regard to which Ra��hapāla excelled
all other disciples, his exemplary conduct appears to be the central theme of the Ra��hapāla-sutta and its parallels. The different versions agree in portraying a young man who,
on hearing a single discourse by the Buddha, is willing to discard a secure and affluent
social position and is ready to risk death just in order to be able to join the Buddhist
monastic community, and who in his later meeting with his family and the local king
conducts himself as an exemplary monk.
Thus, after the preceding discourse in the Majjhima-nikāya, the Gha�īkāra-sutta, has
depicted an exemplary layman, the present discourse presents the image of an exemplary monk. [127] The same mode of presentation continues with the next discourse, the
Makhādeva-sutta, which describes the conduct of an exemplary king. In this way an in

pa; cf. also Feer 1891: 358 note 1 and Speyer 1909/1970: 123 note 1. T 199 at T IV 196c19 presents

more settled life style, the forest life appears to have remained an important factor throughout Buddhist
history, cf. Ray 1994: 251-292 on the importance of the forest life for the early Mahāyāna and Carrithers 1983b for an account of the revival of the forest life in modern day Theravāda (for a critical assessment of Ray 1994 cf. Sasaki 2004). Durt 1991: 6 relates “the tendency of Indian monks to settle in
urban monasteries more than in forests” to the circumstance that “the development of Indian Buddhism
was connected with the expansion of an urban and mercantile civilization”.

ner connection between these three discourses can be seen, all of which use a predominantly narrative mode to inculcate Buddhist values. This inner connection might offer
an additional explanation why the Gha�īkāra-sutta and the Ra��hapāla-sutta have been
included together with the Makhādeva-sutta in a chapter on kings, even though in the
former two discourses kings do not play a central role.


[[MN83]] Makhādeva-sutta [128]

The Makhādeva-sutta, the “discourse on Makhādeva”, is a jātaka tale of a past life of
the Buddha as a king. This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama and another parallel in the Ekottarika-āgama. [129] Parts of the same tale recur also in the introductory section of the Ekottarika-āgama collection, [130] and in a discourse quotation in
Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya, preserved in Tibetan. [131]
The events described in the Makhādeva-sutta are also recorded in the Bhai�ajyavastu
of the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, preserved in Tibetan, [132] in the Pāli Jātaka collection, [133] and in a collection of tales of former existences of the Buddha, assembled under
the heading of the six perfections, preserved in Chinese translation. [134]
The story of King Nimi, which constitutes the theme of the later part of the Makhādeva-sutta and its parallels, has also made its way as a tale on its own into the Pāli Jātaka and Chinese Dharmapada Avadāna collections. [135]


128 Be-MN II 262,1 and the Se-MN II 415,1 have the title Maghadeva-sutta.
129 [[MA67]] at T I 511c-515b and [[EA50.4]] at T II 806c-810b. [[MA67]] and [[EA50.4]] agree with [[MN83]] on locating the discourse at Mithilā, the capital of the Videha country, on which cf., e.g., Law 1932/1979:
30. [[EA50.4]] at T II 806c21, however, places Mithilā in the Magadha country, . [[MA67]] has the
title “discourse on Mahādeva’s Mango Grove”, . On [[MA67]] cf. also Minh Chau 1964/

to which the monk Uttara, to whom Ānanda entrusts the preservation of the Ekottarika-āgama collection, had in a former life been a descendant of King Ma(k)hādeva, cf. [[EA1]] at T II 552a23.

Before turning to the actual story of king Makhādeva, it is worthy of note that the
Sanskrit version of the Bhai�ajyavastu of the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, which only
refers to the present tale, indicates that the details should be supplied from the Mahādeva-sūtra found in the chapter on kings of the Madhyama-āgama. [136] This indication
accords with the actual location of the present discourse in the Chinese Madhyamaāgama collection.
The Sanskrit Bhai�ajyavastu of the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya gives another four
such references to Madhyama-āgama discourses, each time specifying the chapter
where the discourses are to be found. [137] Each of these references corresponds to the
location of the equivalent discourse in the Chinese Madhyama-āgama. [138] Although
these locations accord with the indications given in the Bhai�ajyavastu, all five Chinese discourses have titles that differ from the titles mentioned in the Bhai�ajyavastu. [139]


recurrent feature of Jātaka literature cf. Feer 1875: 403, for an examination of the same phenomena cf.
also Lüders 1940a: 96 and id. 1940c: 356.
136 Dutt 1984a: 111,20: vistare�a mahādevasūtre madhyamāgame rājasa�yuktakanipāte. This might intend only the first part of the present discourse, as the Bhai�ajyavastu refers in a similar way to the tale
of Nimi, Dutt 1984a: 112,19: vistare�a nimisūtre madhyamāgame rājasa�yuktakanipāte, so that perhaps the later part of what now is [[MN83]] or [[MA67]] was considered a separate discourse, similar to the
separate Pāli Jātaka and Chinese Dharmapada Avadāna accounts. The Chinese translation of the Bhai�ajyavastu, T 1448 at T XXIV 58c1, also indicates that the story of Mahādeva,, is located in the
Madhyama-āgama, without, however, specifying in which chapter it can be found.
137 The Bhai�ajyavastu in Dutt 1984a: 93,10 refers to the Māndhāt�-sūtra found in the Rājasa�yuktanipāta, p. 98,15 to the Velāma-sūtra in the Brāhma�anipāta, p. 112,19 to the Nimi-sūtra in the Rājasa�yuktanipāta, and p. 217,12 to the Nandīpāla-sūtra in the Rājasa�yuktanikāya (Skilling 1997a: 282 note
65 suggests that in the last case “nikāya could be a wrong reading for nipāta”). De Jong 1979c: 400
notes the following counterpart references in the Chinese translation: T 1448 at T XXIV 56b11 (Māndhāt�), T 1448 at T XXIV 57b13 (Velāma), T 1448 at T XXIV 58c1 (Mahādeva), and T 1448 at T XXIV
58c16 (Nimi). T 1448, however, mostly refers to the subject matter without explicitly giving the discourse title, and only specifies the chapter of the Madhyama-āgama collection in the case of the Māndhāt�-sūtra, T 1448 at T XXIV 56b11: (where the reading 大天
supports Skilling’s suggestion that nikāya in the Sanskrit version is an error for nipāta). The location of
the Mahādeva-sūtra is given also in T 1448 at T XXIV 30b8. I already surveyed these instances in
Anālayo 2010m: 69.
138 Waldschmidt 1980a: 142-144 identifies the following counterparts: the Māndhāt�-sūtra corresponds to
[[MA60]] at T I 494b-496a, the Velāma-sūtra corresponds to [[MA155]] at T I 677a-678a, the Mahādevasūtra and the Nimi-sūtra correspond to [[MA67]] at T I 511c-515b, and the Nandīpāla-sūtra corresponds
to [[MA63]] at T I 499a-503a. [[MA60]] [[MA63]] and [[MA67]] are indeed found in the “chapter collection on
kings”, Rājasa�yuktakanipāta, and [[MA155]] occurs in the “chapter on Brahmins”, Brāhma�anipāta, . The Pāli counterpart to the Māndhāt�-sūtra is the Mandhātu-jātaka, Jā 258 in Jā II
310-314, the Pāli parallel to the Velāma-sūtra 頂生, is the 如中阿笈摩王法相應品中廣說 Velama-sutta, [[AN9.20]] at AN IV 392-396, the Ma- 品
hādeva-sūtra and the Nimi-sūtra have their Pāli counterpart in the Makhādeva-sutta, [[MN83]] at MN II
74-83, and the Pāli counterpart to the Nandīpāla-sūtra is the Gha�īkārā-sutta, [[MN81]] at MN II 45-54.
Thus the Pāli parallels occur in different collections.
139 The counterpart to the Māndhāt�-sūtra, [[MA60]] at T I 494b9, has the title, “discourse on four
continents”. The counterpart to the Velāma-sūtra, [[MA155]] at T I 677a8, has the title, the
“discourse to Sudatta”. The counterpart to the Mahādeva-sūtra and the Nimi-sūtra, [[MA67]] at T I 511c21,

That the indications given in the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya on the location of discourses should agree with the Madhyama-āgama collection but disagree in regard to
the respective titles of these discourses further supports a point already made above, in
that the titles of discourses appear to have been relatively open to change during the
process of transmission. [140]

MN II 74  The Makhādeva-sutta, its Madhyama-āgama and Ekottarika-āgama parallels, and the
Tibetan Bhai�ajyavastu begin by reporting that the Buddha displayed a smile. [141] The
introductory section of the Ekottarika-āgama and the collection of tales on the six perfections add that lights of five different colours emanated from the Buddha’s mouth
when he displayed this smile. [142]
Asked by Ānanda about the reason for this smile, the Buddha narrated the tale of a
former king, whose name the Pāli editions give as Makhādeva or Maghadeva, whereas
the parallel versions mostly speak of King Mahādeva. [143] The Madhyama-āgama and


has the title, “discourse at Mahādeva’s Mango Grove”. The counterpart to the Nandīpālasūtra, [[MA63]] at T I 499a9, has the title,, corresponding to its location at Vebha�i�ga or
Vaibhi�i�gyā. Notably, Abhidh-k-� gives the title of [[MA67]] just as lha chen po, cf. D (4094) mngon
pa, ju 76b2 or Q (5595) tu 86a8, thereby agreeing with the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya (and the *Karmavibha�gopadeśa in Lévi 1932a: 161,14). In the case of [[MA63]] however, Abhidh-k-� uses the name
of the location as the discourse’s title, thereby agreeing with the Madhyama-āgama collection against
the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, cf. D (4094) mngon pa, ju 244b4 or Q (5595) tu 279a7, cf. also Skilling 1997a: 279-285.
140 Cf. above pp. 106 and 123.
141 Xuánzàng ( ) reports that a stūpa had been erected in the place where this was believed to have
happened, cf. T 2087 at T LI 909b 大天㮈林經 8, translated in Beal 1884/2001b: 74. In regard to stūpa worship,
Schopen 1989/1997: 91 assumes this to be characteristic of Buddhism already at a very early stage and 鞞婆陵耆經
concludes that “the total absence of rules regarding stūpas in the Pāli Vinaya would seem to make sense
only if they had been systematically removed”. A perhaps more reasonable explanation is given by
Hirakawa 1993/1998: 272, who takes the absence of any reference to stūpa worship to indicate that the
Pāli Vinaya was closed by the time stūpa worship came to be generally practised; cf. also Bareau 1960:

early date”. For a criticism of Schopen’s assumption cf. also Enomoto 2007: 194-195, Gombrich

Ekottarika-āgama discourses, the discourse quotation in Śamathadeva’s commentary,
and the Tibetan Bhai�ajyavastu differ from the Majjhima-nikāya presentation in that
they present Ma(k)hādeva as a wheel-turning king (cakkavatti rājā). The two Chinese
Āgama versions describe in detail each of the seven treasures of a wheel-turning king, [144]
whereas the two Tibetan versions just enumerate them. [145] The descriptions in the two
Āgama discourses are similar to the portrayal of a wheel-turning king found in the Bālapa��ita-sutta, in which case it is the Pāli version that describes these qualities in detail, while such a treatment is absent from its parallels. [146]
The introduction to the Ekottarika-āgama collection shows an intermediate stage in
the application of the motif of the wheel-turning monarch. While this account does not
introduce Makhādeva as a wheel-turning king, it does present the first descendant of
King Ma(k)hādeva as a wheel-turning king endowed with the seven treasures. [147]
These variations testify to the increasing interest among the Buddhist traditions in the
image of the wheel-turning king, which apparently made them explore this image whenever a suitable opportunity presented itself. Although the basic idea of such a universal
monarch predates Buddhism and thus need not be a sign of lateness in itself, [148] its use
would have become particularly popular with the rise to power of the Mauryan kings.

Sanskrit Bhai�ajyavastu in Dutt 1984a: 111,19 and 112,18 has also preserved a reference to the status of
Mahādeva and Nimi as wheel-turning kings, cf. also T 1448 at T XXIV 58c1, which has the same for
Mahādeva. Another reference to Mahādeva’s status as a wheel-turning king occurs in T 744 at T XVII
553b25. T 211 at T IV 608b9 also presents Nimi as a wheel-turning king. T 152 at T III 48c5+26 speaks
of both as, literally “flying emperors”, which according to Hirakawa 1997: 1273 renders cakravartin, cf. also Chavannes 1910: 322.

147 [[EA1]] at T II 552a16.
148 Armelin 1975: 6, in his detailed study of the concept of a wheel-turning king, notes that the idea of such a
ruler can already be found in Vedic times, although the use of the term cakravartin for this idea appears
to have originated only later. Chakravarti 1996: 6 explains that “the word ... cakkavatti already existed
in sixth century B.C. vocabulary”. Drekmeier 1962: 203 suggests that “the concept of a state ... under
the rule of a chakravartin goes back at least to the tenth century B.C.”. According to Gombrich 1988:
82, the notion of “a world-ruler of untrammelled power is a commonplace of the ideology informing
Vedic ritual 飛行皇帝 ”. Nanayakkara 1977: 592 traces the origins of the idea of a cakravartin to the world ruler,
sa�raj, mentioned in the �gveda, while Wijesekera 1957: 265 points out that the notion of setting in
motion the wheel is also found in the �gveda (associated with Indra). Zimmer 1951: 129 explains that
the “conception of the mahāpuru�a cakravartin, ‘the superman turning the wheel’, goes back not only
to the earliest Vedic, but also to the pre-Vedic, pre-Āryan traditions of India”. On the antiquity of the
concept cf. also Collins 1998: 470, Horsch 1957: 73, Mahony 2005: 1350, Sastri 1940, and Strong 1983b:
48; on the term cakravartin cf. also Gonda 1966: 123. A reference to the cakravartina� can be found in
the Maitrī Upani�ad 1.4 in Radhakrishnan 1953/1992: 797. On the significance of the cakravartin motif in
Buddhist literature cf. also Gokhale 1994/2001d: 129 and Reynolds 1972: 19-21.

MN II 75  The Makhādeva-sutta and its Chinese and Tibetan parallels relate in similar terms
that King Ma(k)hādeva requested his barber to inform him once any of his hair turned
white. [149] When this happened, King Ma(k)hādeva decided to go forth. [150]
The Pāli version indicates that King Ma(k)hādeva had decided to go forth as he had
realized that the appearance of white hair on his head meant that the divine messengers
had manifested, [151] a realization similarly recorded in the Chinese discourses, [152] as well
as in the Tibetan versions. [153] The same insight is also reported in the Pāli Jātaka account of the life of King Ma(k)hādeva, [154] in the Chinese Dharmapada collection, and

149 A Barhut relief that depicts the barber showing the grey hair to the king can be found in Cummings
1982: 44 plate 7; cf. also Barua 1934a: 82-85, Lal Nagar 1993: 160-161, Schlingloff 1981b: 102, and
Sarkar 1990: 124; for further references cf. Grey 1994: 233-234. On the motif of the grey or white hair
in Indian literature cf. Bloomfield 1916: 57-58; for an occurrence in the Jain Pariśi��aparvan 1.95 cf.
Jacobi 1883: 10, translated in Hertel 1908: 25; for parallels to the notion of the messenger of death in
European literature cf. Morris 1885.
150 According to [[MN83]] at MN II 75,16, before going forth King Makhādeva granted his barber an “excellent village”, gāmavara�, which Ps III 311,11 explains to be a “foremost village with a revenue of a
hundred-thousand”, satasahassu��hānaka� je��hakagāma�. [[MN83]] at MN II 75,24 reports that Makhādeva then summoned the crown prince and told him to act in the same manner and also give such a
grant to his barber in future. According to Ps III 311,12, King Makhādeva gave the grant because he
had been mentally agitated by the manifestation of the white hair on his head. Jā I 138,6 elaborates the
same in greater detail, describing how sweat poured down his body and he felt as if he was on fire within, as he realized that the king of death was hovering above him (similar reactions of fear on seeing the
first white hair are associated with another two former lives of the Buddha in Jā 411 at Jā III 393,12 and
Jā 525 at Jā V 177,27). From the perspective of the narration in the Pāli and Chinese discourses, however, it seems as if King Makhādeva had long before expected old age to manifest and was ready to act
on it, otherwise he would not have instructed his barber to keep a look out for the first white hair. The
motif of a gift of a village as a boon for a barber recurs in the Mahāvastu in Basak 1968/2004: 117,5 or
in Senart 1897: 191,16, in this case motivated by the fact that the barber had accomplished the feat of
cutting the king’s hair and beard while the latter was asleep.

in a Chinese Dharmapada Avadāna account of the life of King Nimi. [155] Old age as one
of several divine messengers, exemplifying the impermanent nature of life and the importance of wholesome conduct, is described in more detail in the Devadūta-sutta and
its parallels. [156]
The Makhādeva-sutta and its Ekottarika-āgama parallel report that, after handing over
the kingdom to the crown prince and going forth, King Ma(k)hādeva developed the
four brahmavihāras and was consequently reborn in the Brahmā world. [157] The descendants of King Ma(k)hādeva’s kept living their lives according to the same pattern for

157 [[MN83]] at MN II 77,28 and [[EA50.4]] at T II 808b15. [[MA67]] at T I 513c28 reports that he “practised the
path, practised [as] a royal seer and developed the holy life”, . The Tibetan
Bhai�ajyavastu at D (1) ’dul ba, kha 54a6 or Q (1030) ge 50a4 and Abhidh-k-� at D (4094) mngon pa,
ju 77b2 or Q (5595) tu 87b4 similarly indicate that “he practised the holy life of a seer”, drang srong gi
(Q tu: gis) tshangs par spyod pa spyad do. Hence, these descriptions do not explicitly mention his practice of the four brahmavihāras. The parallel passage in [[EA50.4]] at T II 808b15 speaks of him practising 今我
上體首, the 白生為被盜,, the “four 已有天使召, brahmacariya 時正宜出家 s”, which [[EA50.4]] then shows to stand for the practice of the four
brahmavihāras, ; cf. also Bronkhorst 1993/2000: 94 note 32. Although a more common
way to refer to the brahmavihāras would be or else (appamaññā), alternatively referred to
in [[EA1]] at T II 552a14 as, judging from the implications of in [[EA50.4]] the occurrence of
the same expression in [[MA67]] could also stand for the brahmavihāras, in fact Soothill 1937/2000:

where stands for brahmavihāra. T 744 at T XVII 554a6 also records that King Mahādeva practised, to which it refers to as “four pure practices”, . Anyway, as noted by Shaw
2006: xliii, the tale of Makhādeva ends with what is “a common and natural conclusion to a Jātaka story
in that he leaves the lay life” to go forth and meditate.

early Buddhist literature to convey the sense of a very long time span, perhaps the result of multiplying 梵住 無量
the twelve months of the year by seven, and enhancing the resultant eighty-four by further multiplica- 四等心 梵行
tion by a thousand (eighty-four-thousand can then itself become the basis for further multiplications, 梵行
cf., e.g., Fukita 1997: 158). The number seven has a clearly symbolic sense: PED: 673 s.v. 四梵行 四無量 satta indicates that seven is a number 梵行 “invested with a peculiar magic nimbus”. According to Dumont 1962: 73,
the number 慈, 悲, seven 喜, 護 in ancient India “indicates a totality”, Senart 1882b: 四淨行 285 considers references to seven
days to be “typique et conventionnel”; cf. also Sen 1974: 64. On the number seven in religious traditions
in general cf. Davidson 1917: 406, Keith 1917: 407-408 and 413, and Schimmel 1987: 15-16; cf. also
Gombrich 1975a: 118; on the symbolism of the number twelve in ancient India cf. Spellman 1962.
Symbolic use of the number seven can be seen, for example, in Jā 514 at Jā V 48,28, which depicts the
long time it took a hunter to reach a remote area by indicating that his journey lasted seven years, seven
months, and seven days. Another instance can be found in [[AN7.58]] at AN IV 89,4 and its parallel MĀ



MN II 76


472   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


MN II 79 The Pāli and Chinese discourses, as well as the Tibetan Bhai�ajyavastu, relate in
similar terms that the gods of the Thirty-three were desirous to see Nimi, one of the descendants in the lineage of kings instituted by Ma(k)hādeva. [159] Sakka thereon invited
Nimi on behalf of the gods of the Thirty-three and sent his chariot to fetch him. [160]
The Makhādeva-sutta, its Chinese parallels, and the Tibetan Bhai�ajyavastu report
that Nimi wanted to be taken to heaven along both possible paths, the path that leads
through the spheres where evildoers experience their retribution and the path that goes
via the spheres where the result of wholesome conduct is experienced. The three dis
138 at T I 646b18 (cf. also [[MA61]] at T I 496b5), according to which the Buddha in a past life practised
loving kindness for seven years. As a result of such prolonged practice, he was not reborn in the sensual world for seven aeons. Yet another example can be found in [[MN10]] at MN I 62,34, which speaks
of mindfulness practice undertaken for various time periods that range from seven years to seven days.
The parallel [[MA98]] at T I 584b18 differs in so far as it speaks of a period that ranges from seven years
to a single day or night. The time range depicted in [[MN10]] recurs also in the Mahāvastu counterpart to
the Mahāgovinda-sutta, Basak 1968/2004: 132,6 or Senart 1897: 219,4 (another example of this pattern
can be found in the Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1977: 189,1, although in this case the series describes
different heights instead of different time periods); cf. also fragment 420v4 of the P���hapāla-sūtra in
Melzer 2006: 272, which speaks of personally realizing an entirely happy world and the path leading to
it for a period ranging from seven years to less than a moment. What is particularly noteworthy is that,
after counting down by single years from seven years to one year, the P���hapāla-sūtra fragment, [[MN10]] [[MA98]] and the Mahāvastu next speak of seven months, after which they again count down by single
months. Had their presentation followed numerical logic, it would have proceeded from a single year to
eleven months instead. This shows that the mode of counting is influenced by the symbolic value of the
number seven. A departure from this pattern can be found, however, in [[AN10.46]] at AN V 85,4, where a
countdown of time periods by years, months and days revolves around the number ten instead of the
number seven.
159 When describing the succession of kings that reigned after Mahādeva, [[EA50.4]] at T II 808c13 narrates
that seven days after the going forth of the next wheel-turning king his seven treasures disappeared. This
disappearance motivated the grandson of Mahādeva to visit his father for advice, who explained to his
son that the seven treasures were not inheritable. The father then instructed his son how to rule the kingdom rightly, as then the seven treasures might reappear. This account brings to mind a similar description of the succession of wheel-turning kings given in the Cakkavatti-(sīhanāda)-sutta and its parallels,
[[DN26]] at DN III 60,9, [[DA6]] at T I 39b24, and [[MA70]] at T I 520c14. It is perhaps also noteworthy that
[[EA50.4]] gives a full account of the succeeding king’s reaction to this disappearance only when describing the disappearance of the seven treasures after the son of King Mahādeva had gone forth, not when
describing what happened after King Mahādeva went forth (where it only notices the disappearance of
the woman treasure, not of the other six treasures, cf. [[EA50.4]] at T II 808b17). This brings to mind the
earlier noted fact that [[EA1]] at T II 552a16 only associates the wheel-turning king motif with the son of
Mahādeva, giving the impression that the motif of the wheel-turning king was applied in a somewhat
inconsistent manner in both Ekottarika-āgama versions.
160 While according to [[MN83]] at MN II 80,24 and the Tibetan Bhai�ajyavastu at D (1) ’dul ba, kha 55a3 or
Q (1030) ge 50b8 this chariot was drawn by a thousand thoroughbred horses, sahassayutta ājaññaratha
and rta cang shes stong dang ldan pa’i shing rta, according to [[MA67]] at T I 514c11 it was drawn by a
thousand elephants, . [[EA50.4]] at T II 809b21 agrees with [[MN83]] that the chariot was drawn by
horses,, without, however, specifying their number. [[EA50.4]] at T II 809b16 also differs from the
other versions in as much as, instead of Sakka himself calling on Nimi, a heavenly maiden was sent by
Sakka to invite Nimi.

courses and the Tibetan Bhai�ajyavastu refer to this journey only in brief, while the Jātaka tale reports it in considerable detail. [161]
The same Jātaka tale also throws a light on why the gods of the Thirty-three would
want to invite Nimi for a visit. According to this Jātaka account, King Nimi had urged
others to undertake wholesome deeds to such an extent that large numbers of his subjects were reborn among the gods of the Thirty-three. [162] As these newly arisen gods of
the Thirty-three owed their favourable rebirth to his instructions, it would be quite natural
that they should wish to invite him.
The Ekottarika-āgama account reports that, when visiting the gods of the Thirty-three,
Nimi delivered a set of instructions to them. [163] From the perspective of the Jātaka account, this would then have been just a continuation of his earlier tutorial relationship
with them.
The Pāli and Chinese discourses, as well as the Tibetan Bhai�ajyavastu, relate that, on
arrival in the heaven of the Thirty-three, Nimi was invited to enjoy himself. He preferred
to return home, however, and rather continue his exemplary and meritorious conduct. [164]
The Makhādeva-sutta and its Chinese discourse parallels note that Nimi was the last
of the kings that kept up the way of acting instituted by King Ma(k)hādeva. [165] According to the collection of tales on the six perfections, Nimi was in fact a reincarnation of
Ma(k)hādeva. [166] The Jātaka tale reports the same, explaining that Ma(k)hādeva had de

charioteer to move on.

163 [[EA50.4]] at T II 809c22.
164 [[MN83]] at MN II 80,19 reports that Nimi just briefly declined and indicated that he wished to return home
to conduct himself as a righteous king. According to [[MA67]] at T I 515a3 and the Bhai�ajyavastu in
Dutt 1984a: 113,4 and at D (1) ’dul ba, kha 55b6 or Q (1030) ge 51b3, he expressed his sentiments in
more detail by comparing the temporary nature of the heavenly pleasures of the Thirty-three to a borrowed chariot. Jā 494 at Jā IV 358,2, Jā 541 at Jā VI 127,32 (quoted in Ps III 318,3), and T 152 at T III
49b14 similarly report that Nimi compared a sojourn among the Thirty-three to borrowed goods. According to [[EA50.4]] at T II 809c17, after being asked three times to remain, Nimi finally explained that
the heaven of the Thirty-three did not provide the appropriate conditions for practising the path and that
he wanted to follow his father’s example and eventually go forth.
165 [[EA50.4]] at T II 810a14 reports the discontinuation of Mahādeva’s conduct in additional detail, narrating
how once Nimi’s son did not keep up the tradition of his forefathers the condition of the whole country
deteriorated and people became short lived, diseased, and poor. Poverty led to theft, to which the king
reacted by instituting the death penalty. This reaction in turn caused further increase of unwholesome
actions of all kinds. This account brings to mind the deterioration of conditions due to bad rulership depicted in the Cakkavatti-(sīhanāda)-sutta, [[DN26]] at DN III 65,15, and its parallels [[DA6]] at T I 40b23
and [[MA70]] at T I 522a28. Another parallelism occurs earlier, as part of the description of King Nimi’s
visit to the Heaven of the Thirty-three. According to [[EA50.4]] at T II 809c7, Sakka shared his throne
with Nimi, and when the two sat together on the throne they looked completely alike. A similar
description can be found in the tale of King Māndhāt� in [[MA60]] at T I 495b17 and in the Divyāvadāna
in Cowell 1886: 222,17 or in Vaidya 1999: 137,20 (another version of this story, Jā 258 at Jā II 310314, does not mention their sharing of the throne).

cided to take birth as Nimi in order to make sure that the conduct instituted by him was
carried to its numerical completion of eighty-four-thousand descendants. [167]

MN II 82  According to the Makhādeva-sutta, its Chinese parallels, and the Tibetan Bhai�ajyavastu, the Buddha identified Ma(k)hādeva as one of his former lives and explained
that the type of practice he had instituted at that time did not lead to liberation, unlike
the practice he had instituted now, [168] followed by exhorting Ānanda that he should
maintain the presently instituted tradition alive. [169]


Vaidya 1958b: 119,14 also reckons King Nimi to have been a former life of the Buddha, while according to [[EA50.4]] at T II 810a27 he was a former life of Ānanda. Nimi’s son, who discontinued the conduct instituted by King Mahādeva, was according to [[EA50.4]] at T II 810a29 a former life of Devadatta.
According to the identifications reported in Jā 9 at Jā I 139,28 and Jā 541 at Jā VI 129,16, Ānanda had
been Makhādeva’s barber and then Sakka’s charioteer Mātali, who took King Nimi to the heaven of the
Thirty-three. Tanabe 2002/2003: 50 comments that the tale of King Nimi is based on an ancient Indian
tale that was adopted as a story reporting a previous life of the Buddha and then introduced into the
Buddhist canon.
167 Jā 541 at Jā VI 96,17. The same account continues by reporting that the soothsayers told the king that
his newborn son had come to “round off” the number of descendants. The king then associated the idea
of “rounding off” with the “rim” of a wheel and decided to give his son the name nemi, “rim” (for an
explanation of the name of the twenty-second Jain Tīrtha�kara that similarly involves the sense of
nemi as a wheel-rim cf. von Glasenapp 1925/1999: 317 and Jacobi 1884/1996: 277 note 1). The Tibetan Bhai�ajyavastu at D (1) ’dul ba, kha 54b2 or Q (1030) ge 50a7 similarly renders his name as mu
khyud, “rim”. Dīp 3:35 in Oldenberg 1879: 28,24 records his name as Nemiyo, whereas the protagonist
of [[MN83]] at MN II 78,28 has the name Nimi. [[MA67]] at T I 514b8 renders his name as, nri-mji
(following Pulleyblank 1991: 212 and 223). T 152 at T III 48c27 and T 211 at T IV 608b9 render his
name as, which according to Chavannes 1910: 324 points to Nami, while Willemen 1999: 220 translates the same as Nemi. [[EA50.4]] at T II 809a23 renders his name as, a character that according to
Mathews 1963: 466 among others means “alternating”. Could this be an attempt to render nimi, for
which MW: 551 s.v. nimi gives “the closing or winking of the eyes, twinkling”? Still other renderings
can be found in [[DA6]] at T I 39b5, which renders the name (Da�ha)nemi found in [[DN26]] at DN III 59,1
(on which cf. also Collins 1996: 428) as ( ), cf. also Karashima 1994: 179, and in the Mahāvyutpatti no. 3583 in Sakaki 1926: 248, which employs the rendering
168 [[MN83]] at MN II 82,24, [[MA67]] at T I 515a14, [[EA50.4]] at T II 810b6, and D (1) ’dul ba, kha 56a2 or Q
(1030) ge 51b6. [[EA1]] at T II 552a28 also contrasts the way of practice instituted by King Mahādeva 尼彌
with the liberating teachings of the Buddha. While according to [[MN83]] at MN II 82,33, [[MA67]] at T I
515a26, and D (1) 南 ’dul ba, kha 56b2 or Q (1030) ge 52a5 the Buddha explained that the path he taught
at present is the noble eightfold path, [[EA50.4]] at T II 810b11 does not report such an identification. A 荏
comparable case can be found in [[DN19]] at DN II 251,18, which contrasts the practice instituted by the
bodhisattva in a former life with the Buddha’s present teaching of the noble eightfold path, while the
parallel [[DA3]] at T I 34a21 (cf. also Hahlweg 1954: 150) does not mention the noble eightfold path.
169 In [[MN83]] at MN II 83,8 this exhortation is worded in the plural, 堅固 念 ta� vo aha�, ānanda, eva� vadāmi,
giving the impression that other monks were also present, even though 輻輞. [[MN83]] at MN II 83,12 concludes
with only Ānanda rejoicing in the discourse. [[EA50.4]] at T II 810b19 similarly reports only Ānanda rejoicing, even though [[EA50.4]] at T II 806c22 indicates that the Buddha was in the company of one-thousand-two-hundred-fifty monks. Only [[MA67]] at T I 515a29 explicitly states that “other monks” also rejoiced. As already mentioned above, p. 66, such variations are mainly differences in formulation, as by
naming the most prominent person anyone else present appears to be included, so that a statement
according to which “Ānanda rejoiced” would cover the delight of other monks that were present as well.

[[MN84]] Madhura-sutta

The Madhura-sutta, the “discourse at Madhurā”, [170] examines the Brahminical claim
to supremacy among ancient Indian social classes. This discourse has a parallel in the
Sa�yukta-āgama. [171]
The Madhura-sutta and its Sa�yukta-āgama parallel report in similar terms that the
king of Madhurā had asked Mahākaccāna’s opinion on the claim made by the Brahmins
to being the superior social class (va��a). [172] In reply, Mahākaccāna clarified that the
Brahminical claim to superiority was mere hearsay. According to the Sa�yukta-āgama
version, he also explained that what really matters are one’s own deeds. [173]
The Madhura-sutta illustrates that economic might is more powerful than class membership with the example of a wealthy person from any of the four classes who is served
by members of each of these four classes. [174] Instead of Brahmins, warriors, merchants,
and workers, the Sa�yukta-āgama version’s explanation of the same point speaks of
Brahmins, warriors, and two types of householder. [175] Other discourses in the Sa�yukta

170 Jaini 1989: 215 comments that “Mathurā is always referred to as Madhurā in the Pāli texts. It is difficult to ascertain whether the Pāli suttas retain the original name of the city or only a variant spelling of
the same”.
171 The parallel is [[SA548]] at T II 142a-143a, for which Akanuma 1929/1990: 60 gives, corresponding to Madhurā, as a tentative title.
172 A circumstantial difference between the two versions is that [[MN84]] at MN II 83,18 begins by reporting
Mahākaccāna’s good reputation as a learned and wise arahant and also describes in detail how the king
drove out of town in his chariot to meet Mahākaccāna, while [[SA548]] does not mention Mahākaccāna’s
reputation, nor does it describe in what manner the king approached him.
173 [[SA548]] at T II 142b2: “great king, you should know that [one’s] deeds are what is truly real [in this regard], it depends on [one’s] deeds”,, a remark that might be related in
meaning to a statement found in [[SN22.3]] at [[SNP650]] according to which it is through one’s deeds that one
becomes a [true] Brahmin, cf. also [[SNP1.7]] at [[SNP136]] According to [[SA548]] at T II 142b3, the king then
requested Mahākaccāna to explain this matter in more detail, so that their subsequent discussion is a 摩偷羅
more detailed exposition of this short statement. This becomes particularly evident in [[SA548]] at T II
142b17+c3+23, where after each argument Mahākaccāna refers back to this statement on karma, a statement that recurs also in the king’s final conclusion in [[SA548]] at T II 142c27.
174 [[MN84]] at MN II 84,18. The suggestion that all four classes were able to reach a position of being served
by members of each of the other classes is to some extent surprising. Although some degree of social
fluctuation may well have been possible in ancient India, it seems improbable that members of the
fourth class were able to have members of the other three classes at their service and command. In fact, 大王當知業真實者, 是依業者
the statement in [[MN84]] is formulated as a hypothetical case, so that to apply this possibility to the
worker class may not have been intended as an accurate reflection of ancient Indian social mobility.
175 [[SA548]] at T II 142b6:, a listing which Nakamura 1957: 167 takes to be due
to a tendency on the side of the translator(s) “to adapt the text to the understanding of readers brought
up on Confucian hierarchical ethics”. The same type of enumeration recurs again in [[SA472]] at T II
120c10 (which adds “wilderness men and hunters”,, to this list), where the Pāli parallel [[SN36.14]] at SN IV 219,12 has instead the standard enumeration of the four classes. According to Hirakawa
1997: 403 and 1195, is an equivalent to g�hapati or vaiśya, while corresponds to g�hapati,
to mahāśāla, or to śre��hin. According to Soothill 1937/2000: 257 and 284, refers to a kulapati, a
householder in the sense of being the head of a family, and stands for a g�hapati as a householder

āgama, however, have the standard listing of all four classes that includes the merchants
and the workers. [176] Since the present context is clearly related to class issues, the reference to Brahmins, warriors, and two types of householder could be a confusion of the
four classes with the four types of wise man (a listing that covers Brahmins, warriors,
householders, and recluses), [177] or else a confusion of the four classes with the three
types of great family (a listing that mentions Brahmins, warriors, and householders). [178]
The Sa�yukta-āgama discourse also differs in so far as instead of taking up the possibility of becoming wealthy, it speaks of becoming a king. This results in envisaging
the possibility that Brahmins and householders become kings. [179] The Sa�yukta-āgama
version’s indication that Brahmins and householders can become kings receives support from the Mahāsā�ghika and Sarvāstivāda Vinayas, from the Divyāvadāna, and
from the Mahāvastu. [180]


in general. Hence, even though a subtle difference might be found between the two expressions, their
main import appears to be similar. This impression is born out in [[SA1074]] at T II 279a27+29, which
uses the two terms and to refer to the same group of persons. A similar closeness of meaning of these two expressions can also be seen in their use in the Ekottarika-āgama, where [[EA39.8]] at T
II 732c5+6 uses and interchangeably to refer to the same person. Along similar lines, [[MA64]]
at T I 506a8, [[MA134]] at T I 637c29, and [[MA199]] at T I 763a2 use the combination to represent one of the three great families. These instances show a considerable overlap in meaning between

II 304a9, [[SA1146]] at T II 304b29, and [[SA1235]] at T II 338b14 speak of,,
each of these two ways of presentation corresponding to the four classes usually mentioned in the early
texts. It is noteworthy that between discourses belonging to the same Sa�yukta-āgama collection and
presumably translated by the same translation team, alternative ways of rendering 居士 長者 vessa or vaiśya can
be found. [[SA95]] reads, [[SA1145]] uses, and [[SA548]] employs, even though their Pāli
parallels [[AN5.50]] at AN I 162, 居士 長者 17 (parallel to [[SA95]]), [[SN22.21]] at SN I 99,15 (or SN [2] 135 at SN [2] I 221,3,
parallel to [[SA1145]]) and the present discourse [[MN84]] at MN II 85,9 (parallel to [[SA548]]) all use the 居士大長者
same term vessa, making it probable that the Indic original used for translating these Sa�yukta-āgama
居士 discourses had the same reference to 長者. vessa or vaiśya in each instance.
177 This listing is found in [[SA108]] at T II 33c20 and includes 婆羅門, 剎利, 毘舍 首陀羅, and, being the
counterpart to khattiya, brāhma�a, gahapati, and sama�a in its parallel [[SN22.2]] at SN III 6, 婆羅門, 剎利, 鞞舍 16. 首陀羅
178 This listing shows some variations, as [[SA1042]] at T II 273a7 has, and (preceded in
[[SA1042]] at T II 273a6 by a reference to ), while [[SA1146]] at T II 304c21 has, and
. Thus, these two discourses again point to the close similarity between and . The Pāli
parallels [[MN41]] at MN I 289, 毘舍 2 and [[SN22.14]] at SN I 94, 鞞舍 33 (or SN [2] 132 at SN 居士 [2] I 212,6) speak of khattiya, brāhma�a, and gahapati (each case qualified as mahāsāla).
179 [[SA548]] at T II 142b5+9 speaks of becoming a Brahmin king, of a warrior becoming king, and (twice)
of becoming a householder becoming king,, and .
180 The Mahāsā�ghika Vinaya, T 1425 at T XXII 244b7, in the context of its regulation against theft, defines kings by listing the same four types of king as found in [[SA548]] 剎利, 婆羅門, “about kings – kings [can be] 長者 沙門
designated as warriors, Brahmins, householders, and householders”,
(notably another instance where and feature together in a listing). The Sarvāstivāda 剎利, 婆羅門 居士 Vinaya, T 1435 at T XXIII 309b24, goes a step further, since in its definition of kings it lists not only Brah- 長者 剎利, 婆羅門

The Madhura-sutta and its parallel agree that undertaking the ten unwholesome
courses of action will result in evil rebirth independent of class affiliation. [181] Both versions apply the same principle to the ten wholesome courses of action and their potential to lead to a heavenly rebirth.
The Majjhima-nikāya version next describes someone who breaks into a house, commits burglary, makes an ambush or seduces the wife of another. In each case the king
would punish him, independent of whatever class the culprit may belong to. The Sa�yukta-āgama version takes up the same case at an earlier point of its exposition. [182] It
also differs in so far as it only describes how this person commits a theft, without taking into account the other types of evil conduct mentioned in the Majjhima-nikāya version.
The Madhura-sutta continues by taking up the case of someone gone forth, who would
be worthy of the king’s respect and offerings independent of his former class, an example not found in the Sa�yukta-āgama presentation (see below table 9.4). [183]
The Sa�yukta-āgama discourse concludes by reporting that the king rejoiced in the
exposition and left. According to the Majjhima-nikāya version, however, he expressed
his wish to take refuge and was thereon told by Mahākaccāna that he should take refuge with the Buddha. In reply to the king’s inquiry after the whereabouts of the Buddha, Mahākaccāna explained that the Buddha had passed away. [184] The Majjhima-nikā

head’”, . A similar definition occurs in the Divyāvadāna in Cowell 1886: 544,3 or in Vaidya 1999: 464,19: stry-api ... brāhma�o ’pi vaiśyo ’pi śudro
’pi rājyābhi�eke�ābhi�ikto bhavati rājā. The Mahāvastu in Basak 1968/2004: 105,28 or in Senart 1897:
172,8 introduces a Brahmin king in one of its tales, indicating that from its perspective it was indeed
possible for a Brahmin to take up the office of a king. The same Mahāvastu in Basak 1965: 98,6 or in
Senart 1890: 70,1, in the context of a fable, however, records the statement that “nowhere females are
kings, everywhere males are kings”, na ca kahi� cit istriyo rājā, sarvatra puru�ā rājā. Megasthenes
reports that in a part of India a queen could be found, cf. McCrindle 1877: 147, 156, and 158; cf. also
Altekar 1956: 186. In relation to the Divyāvadāna passage, Oldenberg 1912b: 166 remarks: “won’t it
be experiences and considerations of later times – one may think of the Maurya dynasty – that recommended such broadminded interpretation? 若婆羅門, 若居士, 若女人受王職, ” 亦名為王水澆頂 (“sind es nicht Erfahrungen und Rücksichten späterer
Zeiten – man denke etwa an die Maurya-Dynastie – die zu dieser weitherzigen Interpretation rieten?”);
cf. also Lamotte 1958/1988: 218-219 on Candragupta’s probable low birth.
181 A minor difference in regard to the examination of the ten courses of action is that, according to [[MN84]]
at MN II 86,16, the king on his own indicated that he had heard from arahants about the prospective rebirth in hell, while according to [[SA548]] at T II 142c6 Mahākaccāna asked the king what he had heard
from arahants concerning the rebirth to be expected for undertaking the ten unwholesome courses of
conduct, thereby prompting the king to refer to arahants in his reply.
182 [[SA548]] at T II 142b18 examines the punishment inflicted by a king on a thief before taking up the ten
courses of action, whereas [[MN84]] at MN II 88,7 takes up the topic of the king’s punishment only after
having examined the ten courses of action.
183 [[MN84]] at MN II 89,2. This example seems to fit well into the exposition, as it provides a contrast to the
description of what will happen to someone who breaks the law and incurs the king’s punishment, similar to the earlier contrast between rebirth in heaven and rebirth in hell.
184 [[MN84]] at MN II 90,16. This indication stands in contrast to [[SA548]] at T II 142a18, which begins by re

[[MN85]] Bodhirājakumāra-sutta

The Bodhirājakumāra-sutta, the “discourse to Prince Bodhi”, records a meeting between the Buddha and Prince Bodhi. [186] Although this discourse does not have a parallel
in the Chinese Āgamas, parts of a version of this discourse have been preserved in Sanskrit fragments. [187] Versions of the introductory narration to the Bodhirājakumāra-sutta,

cording that at the time of this discourse the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, so that from the perspective of the Sa�yukta-āgama version he was still alive.
185 [[MN84]] at MN I 90,26: yojanasatam pi maya� gaccheyyāma ta� bhagavanta� dassanāya (Se-MN II
439,12: yojanasata�). A similar statement recurs in [[MN94]] at MN II 162,33 and in SHT V 1332bR3-5
(p. 228). The parallelism between [[MN84]] and [[MN94]] in regard to taking place after the Buddha’s death
had already been noted by Chalmers 1894: 341. On the assumption that a yojana would correspond to
approximately seven miles (cf. also above p. 164 note 106), to cover a distance of a hundred yojanas
would have required a rather long journey.
186 While the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya T 1421 at T XXII 74b13 gives the name of the prince as, corresponding to the name Bodhi used in the parallel passage in the Theravāda Vinaya at Vin II 127,20, most Sanskrit fragments refer to the protagonist of the present discourse as Prince Bodha, cf., e.g., SHT IV 33
folio 21V3, SHT IV 180 folio 1R3, SI B/14 2A3 in Bongard-Levin 1989: 510, or folio 342V3 in Hartmann 2004b: 129. An exception to this pattern is SHT IV 160 folio 20Rc, which reads Bodhi. The uddāna in folio 299V3 in Hartmann 2004b: 123 reads bodha�, suggesting the title Bodha�-sūtra. Alternatively, the uddāna may have abbreviated the title, which in analogy to the Pāli version could also
have been Bodharājakumāra-sūtra.
187 The fragments from the newly discovered Dīrgha-āgama are folios 342-343 in Hartmann 2004b: 129131, with the complete version covering folios 340-344 in Silverlock 2009. Other fragments are SHT

which reports how Prince Bodhi invited the Buddha to a meal, can also be found in the
Theravāda and the Mahīśāsaka Vinayas, [188] and in the Dhammapada commentary. [189]
The Bodhirājakumāra-sutta, the Sanskrit fragments, and the two Vinayas report in
similar terms that Prince Bodhi invited the Buddha for a meal to his newly built palace. [190] On arrival, the Buddha refused to enter the palace, as the steps had been covered
with cloth. Ānanda told Prince Bodhi to remove the cloth, as the Buddha would not
step on it.
According to the Bodhirājakumāra-sutta, the reason given by Ānanda for the Buddha’s reluctance was that the Buddha “looked after future generations”. [191] The Theravāda and Mahīśāsaka Vinayas as well as the Sanskrit fragments speak of his “compassion for future generations”. [192]
The commentary explains that Prince Bodhi was childless and had spread the cloth
with the aspiration that, if the Buddha should step on it, his wish to have a child would
be fulfilled. [193] The Buddha, however, knew that in retribution for an evil deed done in a
past life Prince Bodhi was destined to remain childless, wherefore the Buddha refused
to step on the cloth. The commentary further explains that at the Buddha’s time many
monks had supernormal powers and were able to find out if someone was destined to
remain childless. Based on such knowledge, the monks were able to decide if it was
opportune to step on a cloth on such occasions. In later times, however, monks who
would not have such supernormal powers might not know if it was opportune to step
on a cloth in similar circumstances. If they should step on a cloth and then the couple
were to remain childless, this would cause people to look down on the monks. In order
to prevent this from happening, the Buddha remained silent, out of compassion.


ment Or. 15004/76, Or. 15009/187, and fragment SI B/14 1B correspond to the beginning of the discourse and the invitation of the Buddha at MN II 91-92. SHT IV 33 folios 21-22 and SHT IV 165 folio

480   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


This commentarial explanation does not really help to explain the situation. If the
Buddha knew that Prince Bodhi was to remain childless, that would be sufficient for
not stepping on the cloth, without any need to have concern or compassion for future
generations.
The expression used in this context in the Theravāda Vinaya and in the Sanskrit fragment recurs in several other Pāli discourses, occurrences that suggest compassion for
future generations to stand for acting as a model to be emulated. [194] From this perspective, then, the present passage might simply intend that the Buddha did not step on a
cloth in order to set an example that discourages the keen interest his Indian contemporaries apparently had in such supposedly auspicious actions.
This would be in keeping with a general tendency that manifests repeatedly in the
early discourses, where the search for externals and auspicious tokens is redirected towards inner purification of the mind. [195] In fact, according to the Theravāda Vinaya account the Buddha took the present instance as the occasion to promulgate a rule against
stepping on cloth. [196]
The Mahīśāsaka Vinaya differs from the Theravāda Vinaya, as it does not relate the
present event to a regulation about stepping on cloth. According to the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya, the problem that arose was rather that the monks made a mess when partaking of
the food offered by Prince Bodhi. This behaviour caused the laity to criticize the
monks and led the Buddha to lay down a regulation that food should be received and
partaken of in a proper manner. [197]
The story of how Prince Bodhi wanted the Buddha to step on a cloth recurs also in
the Dhammapada commentary. According to the Dhammapada commentary, Prince
Bodhi in fact asked the Buddha why he was not willing to step on the cloth. In reply,
the Buddha explained that the prince was destined to remain childless, followed by
giving an account of Prince Bodhi’s former evil deed that was responsible for his pre
194 According to [[MN4]] at MN I 23,35 (cf. also [[AN2.3]].9 at AN I 61,1), the Buddha lived a secluded life
style out of compassion for future generations, pacchimañ ca janata� anukampamāno ti. Another example can be found in [[SN16.5]] at SN II 203,5, which reports that Mahākassapa continued to undertake
ascetic practices in spite of his advanced age for the same reason, further explained to imply that in this
way he hoped to set a model to be emulated by others, app’ eva nāma pacchimā janatā di��hanugati�
āpajjeyyu� (B [e] -SN I 405,26, C [e] -SN II 310,7 and S [e] -SN II 339,7: di��hānugati�, C [e] and S [e] : āpajjeyya).
195 Cf., e.g., [[MN7]] at MN I 39,13 and its parallels [[MA93]] at T I 575c23, [[SA1185]] at T II 321b4, [[SA2]] 98 T
II 408c3, [[EA13.5]] at T II 574c15, and T 51 at T I 844a21, which contrast external purification by bathing in sacred rivers with internal purification of the mind. Witanachchi 2005b: 549 comments that the
commentarial explanation, according to which the Buddha did not step on the cloth “because he knew
that the prince’s wish for a child will not be fulfilled, seems to be completely off the mark. If that were
so, there was no reason for the Buddha to have laid down a rule restraining his disciples from following
the practice”.
196 Vin II 129,3. When, however, the demands of the laity to have monks step on cloth became too pressing, this rule was amended. Granoff 2002/2003: 200 note 39 comments that “a monk may step on the
cloth offered by a woman who has just had a miscarriage ... behind this might lie a belief in the fructifying power of the monk’s touch”.

sent childlessness. [198] The evil deed was that Prince Bodhi and his wife in a former life
had survived on eggs and birds, after being shipwrecked, without feeling any remorse
at killing living beings. The Buddha concluded his explanation to Prince Bodhi with a
stanza – the stanza the Dhammapada commentary’s tale is intended to explain – highlighting the need to protect oneself and to remain wakeful during the three watches of
the night. [199]
Whatever may be the final word on the reasons why the Buddha refused to step on
the cloth, the Bodhirājakumāra-sutta reports that, during the conversation that ensued
after the completion of the meal, the Buddha gave an autobiographical account of his
striving for awakening. [200]
At the end of this account, according to the Bodhirājakumāra-sutta Prince Bodhi asked
the Buddha how long it would take a disciple to reach the final goal. According to the
Sanskrit fragment, however, he asked how many qualities were required to reach the
final goal. [201] The Pāli and Sanskrit versions agree that the Buddha replied with a counterquestion, [202] asking Prince Bodhi if he could impart his knowledge to a man with the
following qualities:


198 Dhp-a III 137,2. Dhp-a III 139,7 concludes this tale by reporting that Prince Bodhi attained stream-entry at the end of the Buddha’s exposition.
199 [[DHP|DHP157]] “holding oneself dear, one should well protect oneself, the wise should keep watchful during
any of the three watches of the night”, attānañce piya� jaññā, rakkheyya na� surakkhita�, ti��a� aññatara� yāma�, pa�ijaggeyya pa��ito, with counterparts in stanza 312 in the Patna Dharmapada in
Cone 1989: 185 or in stanza 313 in Roth 1980b: 125, and in stanza 5:15 in the Sanskrit Udāna-(varga)
in Bernhard 1965: 143, with its Tibetan counterpart in stanza 5:16 in Beckh 1911: 22 or in Zongtse
1990: 79. Similar stanzas found in T 196 at T IV 161a7, T 210 at T IV 565c21, T 211 at T IV 593b16, T
212 at T IV 652b11, and T 213 at T IV 780a17 differ in their second part and do not refer to the three
watches. T 211 embeds its version of this stanza into a different story, which describes a monk on the
verge of suicide out of desperation at his inability to learn the Dharma. T 211 at T IV 593b24 concludes
by reporting that, stirred by the verses spoken by the Buddha, this monk soon enough became an arahant; cf. also Willemen 1999: 121-123. Some elements of this story are similar to the tale of Cū�apanthaka at Dhp-a I 239,14, although Cū�apanthaka was not on the verge of suicide, but only about to leave
the order.
200 This account combines the information given in [[MN26]] at MN I 163-173 and [[MN36]] at MN I 240-249.
The Sanskrit fragment does not present this account in full, but indicates that it should be supplemented
from the preceding discourse, the Kāyabhāvanā-sūtra (parallel to [[MN36]]), cf. folio 342R7 in Hartmann
2004b: 129 or Silverlock 2009: 77. E [e] similarly gives this account only in an abbreviated manner, indicating that it should be supplemented, while B [e] -MN II 279-297, C [e] -MN II 484-508, and S [e] -MN II 443470 give it in full.
201 [[MN85]] at MN II 94,8: “how long”, kīva cirena?, whereas according to folio 342V2 in Hartmann 2004b:
129 he inquired “endowed with how many qualities, venerable sir”, k(a)tibhi[r bhada�]tā�gai� sama[nv]āgata?; cf. also Silverlock 2009: 78.
202 Since according to both versions the Buddha used a counter-question, the Pāli version of Prince Bodhi’s
inquiry might fit the context better. If Prince Bodhi had asked about the qualities required to reach liberation, there would have been no need to reply with a counter-question, as the Buddha could just have
listed the five qualities straightaway. A counter-question usually occurs in reply to a type of question
that cannot be answered straightaway, but needs to be tackled by asking a question in return (that is,

  - faithless,

  - ill,

  - deceitful,

  - lazy,

  - stupid. [203]
According to the Majjhima-nikāya version, the Buddha illustrated his reply with the
example of Prince Bodhi teaching someone how to ride an elephant. The Sanskrit fragment version takes up also other abilities that could be taught by Prince Bodhi, such as
elephant and horse riding, driving a chariot, fencing and archery, as well as writing and
calculation. [204]
To bring in several crafts fits the context well, since such variety illustrates that the
task of leading a monk to liberation requires training him in various abilities, instructing him in proper conduct, in the development of concentration, and in the development of insight, [205] just as a prince would not only need to be able to ride an elephant,
but also to ride a horse, to drive a chariot, to fence, and to perform archery. [206]
In the case of calculation and writing, the situation appears less straightforward. Other
Pāli passages indicate that calculation was a specific profession in ancient India, yet
perhaps some basic training in this art would be appropriate in the case of someone
who in future hopes to become a king. [207]


this would be an instance of the pa�ipucchā vyākara�īya pañha, in contrast to the eka�sa vyākara�īya
pañha, cf. [[AN5.55]] at AN I 197,20).This is indeed the case for the prince’s question in the Pāli version,
as the time period required to reach the goal cannot be simply stated, since this time period depends on
the qualities of the practitioner.
203 [[MN85]] at MN II 94,18. SHT IV 180 V3-5 has preserved being faithless, ill, and stupid, and at V8-9
mentions the positive qualities of being honest and energetic, thereby accounting for all five qualities
mentioned in [[MN85]] Similarly, the fragments SI B/14 2A4+B2 and SI B/14 3A1+B4 in BongardLevin 1989: 510-512 mention the positive qualities of faith, health, honesty, energy, and wisdom. Folio
342V7-8 in Hartmann 2004b: 129-130 or Silverlock 2009: 78 only mentions being faithless, deceitful,
and stupid, which Hartmann 2004b: 132 note 34 suggests to be “most likely due to a haplography in
this highly repetitive passage”. Parts of a description of the five factors of striving, mentioned in the
present discourse, have also been preserved in the Sanskrit fragments of the Daśottara-sūtra, cf. fragment [[SN493]]cR2-5 in Mittal 1957: 34.

205 The image of an elephant to illustrate the training of a monk recurs in [[MN125]] at MN III 132,2, which
compares the practice of the gradual path to an elephant trainer who catches and trains a wild elephant.
The image used in [[MN125]] differs from [[MN85]] at MN II 94,13, where the task is only to teach someone how to ride an elephant. To ride an elephant (that would have already been tamed and trained by
someone else) would be considerably less demanding than having to catch and tame a wild elephant.
206 A list of the abilities of a king in [[MN82]] at MN II 69,8 mentions riding a horse, driving a chariot, archery, and fencing, together with riding an elephant; cf. also [[AN10.73]] at AN III 152,29, where these recur as the learning curriculum of a prince.
207 [[DN1]] at DN I 11,10 mentions muddā, ga�anā, and sa�khāna as forms of livelihood. Vin IV 7,5 includes ga�anā together with muddā (S [e] -Vin II 166,4: muddhā) in a listing of various types of craft (on


Chapter 9 Rāja-vagga                                        -  483


The Lalitavistara, [208] the Mahāvastu, and the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya in fact include the art of writing in the curriculum of a prince, [209] while a description of the training of a prince given in a discourse in the Madhyama-āgama does not mention accounting or writing. [210]
The Pāli and Sanskrit versions agree that in reply to the Buddha’s exposition of these
five detrimental qualities, Prince Bodhi remarked that even the presence of one of these
qualities would inhibit someone from being able to learn. [211]
The Bodhirājakumāra-sutta and its Sanskrit parallel repeat their respective treatment
for the complementary positive case of someone who has faith and is healthy, honest,
energetic, and wise. According to both versions, Prince Bodhi remarked that even one
of these five positive qualities would make it easy to teach such a person. [212]
This statement seems to stand to some extent in logical contrast to the earlier statement, according to which even one of the negative qualities would render such a person incapable of learning. The logical consequence of the earlier statement would be
that all five positive qualities are required for being able to learn, not just one of them.
That is, in order to be able to learn someone would need to be not only healthy, for example, but also should have faith and be free from deceit, laziness, and stupidity.
Perhaps the formulation found in both versions is the outcome of stereotyping during
the course of transmission, due to which the pattern of the treatment used for the negative case was applied in an identical manner to the positive case, without noting that
this creates an inner inconsistency.

208 The Lalitavistara in Hokazono 1994: 526,13 or in Lefmann 1902: 126,2 or in Vaidya 1958b: 88,13 lists
various types of scripts, including the script of the devas, etc., which are absent from a list of Indian
scriptures given in the Mahāvastu in Basak 1963a: 160,6 or in Senart 1882a: 135,5 (on the significance
of this listing cf. also the comments in Harrison 2003: 115-116).

A minor difference between the two versions is that in [[MN85]] the Buddha presents all five qualities
and then asks Prince Bodhi if such a person would be able to learn, while in the Sanskrit fragment the
Buddha poses the same question after each of the five qualities, each time Prince Bodhi replying that
someone with this quality would not be able to learn from him.

484   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


The Pāli version illustrates the first quality of faith with the example of a monk’s
confidence in the awakening of the Tathāgata, described with the standard formula for
recollecting the Buddha. [213] The Sanskrit fragment speaks instead of a noble disciple
whose faith is firmly established so that it cannot be shaken by anyone in the world. [214]
The Pāli and Sanskrit versions agree in explaining that to be energetic is to make a
steadfast effort to develop what is wholesome. To this the Sanskrit fragment adds the
determination not to slacken in energy even if the flesh and blood of the body should
dry up and only skin, sinews, and bones remain. [215]

MN II 96  The Pāli version continues by specifying the time period within which a disciple may
reach realization, a time period that ranges from seven years at most to a single dayand-night at least. [216] Instead of listing various time periods, the Sanskrit discourse only
explains that realization can be reached “quickly”. [217] A listing of time periods within


213 [[MN85]] at MN II 95,17: iti pi so bhagavā araha� sammāsambuddho vijjācara�asampanno.
214 Folio 343R7-8 in Hartmann 2004b: 130 or Silverlock 2009: 79 describes that the noble disciple’s faith
has become “rooted and established”, mūlajātā prati��hitā. In other Pāli discourses, such unshakeable
faith appears to be a quality of those who have reached stream-entry. Thus, e.g., [[DN27]] at DN III 84,21
indicates that those whose faith is firm, mūlajātā pati��hitā, can claim to be “born from the mouth” of
the Blessed One, mukhato jāto, an expression the commentary Sv III 865,7 explains to imply that they
have reached the paths and fruits, maggaphalesu pati��hitattā oraso mukhato jāto. [[MN47]] at MN I
320,12 speaks of the same firm faith once a monk can claim that he has “through direct knowledge
come to a conclusion in regard to a certain teaching among the teachings”, abhiññāya idh’ ekacca�
dhamma� dhammesu ni��ham agama� (S [e] -MN I 580,6: ni��ha�gama�). The commentary Ps II 388,23
explains that the firm faith of stream-entry is intended here, mūlajātā ti sotāpattimaggavasena sañjātamūlā. [[MN70]] at MN I 478,32 qualifies the saddhāvimutta, a person who is at least a stream-enterer, to
be endowed with such firm faith, saddhā nivi��hā hoti mūlajātā pati��hitā. [[SN48.42]] at SN V 219,2 indicates that the Brahmin U��ābha had reached firm faith, saddhā nivi��hā mūlajātā pati��hitā, followed
by noting that this Brahmin will not be reborn in this world, which the commentary Spk III 246,24
explains to imply that he was a stream-enterer and a jhāna attainer. These passages indicate that references to such firm faith usually imply at least stream-entry. The same would, however, not work so
well for the Sanskrit version, as this would imply turning the fruit of progress on the path into a requirement for being taught the path.
215 Folio 343V4-5 in Hartmann 2004b: 131 or Silverlock 2009: 80: kāmam tvak snāyv asthi cāvati��hatā�
pariśu�yatu śarīrān mā�saśo�itam. While [[AN4.1]] at AN I 50,8 relates this type of determination to
the Buddha’s breakthrough to awakening, other discourses use the same expression in the context of a
general definition of energetic practice, cf., e.g., [[MN70]] at MN I 481,1, [[SN12.22]] at SN II 28,23, [[SN21.3]] at SN II 276,11, and [[AN8.13]] at AN IV 190,8, similar to the way this determination occurs in the
Sanskrit fragment.
216 [[MN85]] at MN II 96,16 speaks of realising the goal within a period that ranges from seven years to a
single day-and-night, eka� rattindiva�. For practice that takes place only from morning to evening or
from evening to morning, [[MN85]] at MN II 96,19 indicates that “distinction” can be reached, visesa�
adhigamissati. The proclamation in [[MN85]] that practice can lead to realization within a single day-andnight appears to be unique in the Pāli discourses for envisaging such a short time period. A similar position is taken in [[SA703]] at T II 189a24 and in [[SA1121]] at T II 297c19, however, discourses otherwise
not related to [[MN85]]
217 Folio 343V8 in Hartmann 2004b: 131 or Silverlock 2009: 80: k�ipram. Consequently the two versions
also differ on the reason for Prince Bodhi’s appreciation of the Buddha’s teaching, which according to


Chapter 9 Rāja-vagga                                        -  485


which realization can be attained is also found in the two (Mahā-)Satipa��hāna-suttas
and in the Udumbarikasīhanāda-sutta, which, however, reckon a minimum of seven
days to be necessary for reaching full awakening. [218]
The Bodhirājakumāra-sutta and the Sanskrit fragments agree that Prince Bodhi expressed his appreciation and took refuge. [219] Both versions note that refuge had already
been taken on his behalf when he was in his mother’s womb and when he was an infant. [220]


[[MN86]] A�gulimāla-sutta

The A�gulimāla-sutta, the “discourse about A�gulimāla”, records the conversion of
the brigand A�gulimāla. [221] This discourse has five Chinese parallels: two parallels in


[[MN85]] at MN II 96,23 was the ability of the Dharma to lead to distinction within a period of twelve
hours, while according to the Sanskrit fragment folio 344R2 in Hartmann 2004b: 131 or Silverlock
2009: 80 his appreciation was due to the potential of the five factors of striving to lead quickly to the
destruction of the influxes.
218 [[DN22]] at DN II 314,11 (= [[MN10]] at MN I 62,35) and [[DN25]] at DN III 55,21 list time periods that range
from seven years to seven days for reaching realization. The prediction in the parallel to [[MN10]] [[MA98]] at T I 584b24, corresponds to [[MN85]] in as much as it envisages realization for a period of practice
(of the four satipa��hānas) from seven years down to a single day-and-night, followed by indicating
that by undertaking practice from morning to evening or from evening to morning, “progress”,,
can be reached (Hirakawa 1997: 596 gives parā-√kram and ā-√kram as possible equivalents for, a
similar description, found in fragment 421r7 of the P���hapāla-sūtra in Melzer 2006: 274, speaks of
reaching viśe�a if practice is undertaken from evening to morning or from morning to evening). An example for the possibility of reaching realization within a very short time can be found in [[UD1.10]] at [[UD8.13]] which reports that Bāhiya, a non-Buddhist ascetic, reached full awakening during his very first
meeting with the Buddha, right after receiving a short but penetrative instruction.
219 According to the Sanskrit fragments, the prince employed a golden pitcher when taking refuge, apparently pouring out water in a ceremonial gesture, cf. folio 344R8 in Silverlock 2009: 80, SHT IV 33 folio 28V4 and SHT IV 165 folio 24V5-6. A golden pitcher occurs in a similar contexts in the Sa�ghabhedavastu, cf. Gnoli 1978a: 25,39, where at the conclusion of a meal offering to the Buddha Kāśyapa 昇進
the king of the country invites the Buddha and the monks for the rains residence, Gnoli 1977: 166, 昇進 10,
where King Bimbisāra offers the Squirrels’ Feeding Ground, and Gnoli 1977: 180,26, where Anāthapi��ada offers Jeta’s Grove.
220 According to [[MN85]] at MN II 97,2+10, when the prince’s mother was pregnant with him, she took refuge in his name when visiting the Buddha in the Ghositārāma at Kosambī, and later on his nurse took
refuge in his name when the Buddha was staying in the Bhesaka�ā Grove at Mount Su�sumāra, the
same location where [[MN85]] takes place. The Sanskrit fragments give one location of taking refuge as
the Gho�ilārāma in Kauśāmbī, cf. folio 344R5 in Silverlock 2009: 80, SHT IV 33 folio 24R6a; cf. also
SHT IV 165 folio 24V2 and the Hoernle fragment 149/280R6, no. 12 in Hartmann 1991: 77. The other
location is the Badarikārāma, Badārikārāma, or Batarikārāma, cf. folio 344R7 in Silverlock 2009: 80,
SHT IV 33 folio 24R4, SHT IV 180 folio 1R6, and Hoernle fragment 149/280R4, no. 12 in Hartmann
1991: 77 (compared to [[MN85]] SHT IV 33 folio 24 and the Hoernle fragments refer to these two locations in the opposite sequence). This grove would have been close to the Ghositārāma, as in [[SN22.89]]
at SN III 126-132 a discussion between the monk Khemaka and a group of monks takes place by way
of sending a messenger back and forth between these two places.

two Sa�yukta-āgama collections, one parallel in the Ekottarika-āgama, and two parallels in the form of individual translations. [222] Parts of the present discourse have also
been preserved in Sanskrit fragments. [223]
The story of A�gulimāla recurs, moreover, in an Udāna-(varga) preserved in Chinese. [224] A version of the present narration is also found in the “discourse on the wise
and the fool”, a collection of Buddhist tales extant in Chinese and Tibetan. [225] In addition, the events surrounding A�gulimāla have also served as the basis for the composition of a Mahāyāna sūtra, extant in Chinese and Tibetan translation. [226]
The A�gulimāla-sutta and its discourse parallels vary in the degree to which they incorporate various narrations and events that took place either before or after the encounter between A�gulimāla and the Buddha (see table 9.5)

MN II 98  Regarding the actual encounter between the Buddha and A�gulimāla, which is narrated in all versions, according to the A�gulimāla-sutta and its Chinese parallels the
Buddha had been proceeding towards A�gulimāla’s haunts, but was warned by onlookers to desist from proceeding further.

222 The parallels are [[SA1077]] at T II 280c-281c, [[SA2]] 16 at T II 378b-379a, [[EA38.6]] at T II 719b-722c, T

edition, T 118 was translated by Dharmarak�a, cf. also Boucher 1996: 282, and T 119 by Făjù ( ),

According to the restoration of the relevant Hoernle fragment in Hartmann 1998: 358, the Sanskrit version also appears to
have had Magadha as its location. T 118 and T 119 have the title “discourse spoken by the Buddha on
A�gulimāla”, or . Anesaki 1908: 117 gives the title “robber”,, for [[SA1077]] For a translation of [[SA1077]] together with extracts from the present study, cf. Anālayo 2008b; a

In the two Sa�yukta-āgama versions, these onlookers simply tell the Buddha that a
dangerous brigand by the name of A�gulimāla is living in this area. [227] The other versions present the threat posed by A�gulimāla in increasingly stronger degrees:

  - up to forty men had been overpowered by A�gulimāla according to the Pāli version,


227 [[SA1077]] at T II 280c22 and [[SA2]] 16 at T II 378b18.


488   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


  - up to fifty men had met with the same fate according to the Ekottarika-āgama
report,

  - even a hundred men would not dare to oppose him according to one individual
translation,

  - even up to a thousand men had been caught by A�gulimāla according to the other
individual translation. [228]
These differences reveal a tendency to exaggeration, a tendency that makes itself felt
again and again in the A�gulimāla-sutta and its parallels. In as much as the A�gulimālasutta and its parallels present themselves as records of an actual event, it is difficult to
imagine how a single person should be able to overpower a group of forty or fifty men,
leave alone for him to be able to do the same when faced with a thousand men.
The two Sa�yukta-āgama discourses begin directly with their description of how the
Buddha set out on his way towards A�gulimāla. The Pāli discourse and the other Chinese versions precede this with an introductory account. In this introductory account,
the Pāli discourse, the Ekottarika-āgama version, and one of the individual translations
explain that A�gulimāla wore the fingers of his victims as a garland, [229] which explains
why he was called A�gulimāla, “Finger-garland”.
One of the individual translations reports that A�gulimāla had caused harm to villages and towns. [230] The Majjhima-nikāya version goes further, as it records that A�gulimāla had lain waste not only villages and towns, but even whole districts. [231] The commentary explains that people had deserted their homes and fled to Sāvatthī because of
A�gulimāla. [232]
Although the abandonment of a village in the vicinity of A�gulimāla’s murderous
activities seems conceivable, it appears exaggerated to suggest that a single criminal
could cause whole districts to be left deserted. [233]


228 [[MN86]] at MN II 98,16, [[EA38.6]] at T II 719c11, T 118 at T II 509a25 (the reference to the hundred men
occurs here in a different context, namely as a reflection made by A�gulimāla when meeting the Buddha), and T 119 at T II 510c12. The sentence in T 119 indicates that “at his wish that A�gulimāla got all
of them and ate them”, . On adopting a, and variant reading,
the last part of the sentence would indicate that “he got all of them and killed them”,, a preferable reading, as also indicated by a similar expression at a slightly later point in T 119 at T II 510c16:
. The curious intrusion of “to eat”, in the present context in T 119 is nevertheless
noteworthy, as according to Jā 537 at Jā V 456-511 A�gulimāla in a past life feasted on human flesh.

232 Ps III 330,20. 彼鴦崛髻, 從意所欲, 皆取食之 宋, 元 明
233 In a predominantly agricultural society such a mass exodus would imply loss of livelihood for a consid- 皆取殺之
erable part of the population and thus be quite a dramatic decision. According to Wagle 1966: 29-37, a
隨意所欲而殺害 janapada represents a socio-cultural unit in the 食, sense of a region with distinct social habits and customs,
cf. also Gräfe 1974: 168. Although the term janapada would not necessarily imply a geographical dimension as large as a mahājanapada (a term used for the sixteen Indian counties regularly mentioned


Chapter 9 Rāja-vagga                                        -  489


The Majjhima-nikāya version’s suggestion that whole districts had been laid waste
stands, moreover, in contrast to the circumstance that according to the same Majjhimanikāya discourse cowherds, shepherds, ploughmen, and travellers had warned the Buddha of A�gulimāla. [234] Their presence in so close proximity to A�gulimāla suggests that
the area of his activities was not as abandoned as the same version’s description suggests. Hence, its indication that A�gulimāla had laid waste whole districts appears to
be another instance of the above-mentioned tendency to exaggeration.
As part of their introduction to the meeting between the Buddha and A�gulimāla, the
Ekottarika-āgama discourse and the two individual translations relate that a group of
monks had gone into town and witnessed a great crowd complaining to the king and
demanding that action should be taken against the brigand. The Majjhima-nikāya version also records such a complaint made about A�gulimāla to the king, although this
occurs at a later point of its narration, by way of introducing King Pasenadi’s visit to
the Buddha. [235]
According to the Ekottarika-āgama discourse and the two individual translations, after hearing from the monks what had happened in town, the Buddha left for A�gulimāla’s haunts. [236] Hence in these versions, it seems as if the Buddha decided to approach
A�gulimāla in order to prevent him being arrested by the king. [237]
One of the individual translations additionally precedes this introductory account by
narrating the story that caused A�gulimāla to become a murderer. This account resembles in several respects the story of A�gulimāla’s youth given in the Pāli commentary.
According to the description given in this individual translation, A�gulimāla had
been an extraordinary strong, intelligent, and beautiful young Brahmin. The wife of his
teacher had fallen in love with him and tried to seduce him. He, however, refused to
comply with her wishes. Enraged, she pretended to her husband that A�gulimāla had
forcefully tried to seduce her. Out of fear of A�gulimāla’s strength, the teacher did not
dare to punish him directly and thus devised the idea to command A�gulimāla that he
should procure the fingers obtained by killing a hundred victims within a single day,
hoping that this would lead A�gulimāla to be reborn in hell. [238]


elsewhere in the discourses) a janapada comprises a considerable area with “villages”, gāmas, “towns”,
nigamas, and even “fortified cities”, nagaras, on which cf. also Erdosy 1995: 114 and Ghosh 1973: 46.
Thus, to turn several such districts into “no-districts”, in other words, to devastate an entire or even several janapadas, would be an impossible feat for a single man, no matter what remarkable strength he is
supposed to possess.

490   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


The Chinese Udāna-(varga) offers a similar account, differing in so far as it speaks
of a thousand victims to be killed, a number also mentioned in the Ekottarika-āgama
version, in the “discourse on the wise and the fool”, and in the Pāli commentary. [239]
The Pāli commentarial narration differs from the individual translation and the Chinese Udāna-(varga) account in so far as it attributes A�gulimāla’s defamation to jealous fellow students. The commentary to the A�gulimāla Theragāthā agrees with the
individual translation that out of fear of A�gulimāla’s strength the teacher did not try to
kill him. [240] According to the Majjhima-nikāya commentary, however, the teacher desisted from killing his student A�gulimāla in order to avoid damaging his reputation as
a teacher. [241] Both commentaries relate that already at A�gulimāla’s birth it had become
clear that he was destined to become a brigand, thereby presenting him in a less favourable light than the individual translation and the Udāna-(varga). [242]
The Majjhima-nikāya commentary explains that A�gulimāla had decided to wear the
fingers as a garland in order to keep count of his victims. According to the Ekottarikaāgama discourse, the individual translation, and the Udāna-(varga) account, however,
his teacher had instructed him to make a garland out of the fingers of his victims. [243]
Whatever may have been the rationale for constructing such a garland, it would have
been impossible to wear it, so that the idea of a garland with a ‘thousand’ fingers is
perhaps best understood in a symbolic sense as a garland with ‘many’ fingers. [244]


239 T 212 at T IV 703b17. Although [[EA38.6]] does not directly report the teacher’s instruction, in its description of A�gulimāla’s thought after his verse exchange with the Buddha, [[EA38.6]] at T II 720b1 records him reflecting on his teacher’s instruction to kill a thousand men and make a garland out of their
fingers, . The “discourse on the wise and the fool” specifies that the teacher
demanded the fingers of a thousand victims within a period of seven days, cf. T 202 at T IV 423c28:
and Schmidt 1843: 242,3: nyin zhag bdun gyis ... mi stong gi mgo
bcad nas sor mi re re zhing blangs nas. According to Ps III 330,1, the teacher told him that he should
“kill a thousand by-passers”, ja�ghasahassa� ghātehi (it seems preferable to take ja�gha in this sense,
a meaning which suggests itself from the compound ja�ghavihāra, “a walker’s abiding”, e.g., at [[MN18]]
at MN I 108,20, although literally ja�ghasahassa� ghātehi would mean to “kill a thousand legs”).
240 Th-a III 55,31.
241 Ps III 329,21. Such differences between commentaries on the same tale are not uncommon, in fact according to Goonesekera 1967: 346 “there are numerous instances where accounts of the same episode
in the different 能取千人殺, a��hakathā 以指作鬘者 differ as regards details”.
242 According to Ps III 328,8 and Th-a IIII 55,2, his father, the Brahmin minister of the king of Kosala, knew
若持七日之中, from the constellation of stars at his son’s birth that A�gulimāla was destined to become a robber. The 斬千人首, 而取一指
father then asked the king to put A�gulimāla to death before he could do any harm.
243 [[EA38.6]] at T II 720b1, T 118 at T II 508c17, and T 212 at T IV 703b17. T 202 at T IV 423c29 and its
Tibetan counterpart in Schmidt 1843: 242,4 report the same. [[EA38.6]] T 118, T 202, and T 212 refer to
this garland as (T 119 at T I 510b24 similarly speaks of ). This suggests this garland to be a form
of hair dress or decoration, instead of being a necklace. In fact, T 118 at T II 508c17 specifies that the
finger garland is to be worn on the forehead, .
244 Although A�gulimāla could have strung up a few fingers and worn them as a garland, making a garland
of a thousand fingers would have become so bulky that he would no longer have been able to use his
weapons. Gombrich 1996: 149 suggests that “the idea that he needed a thousand must have arisen from
an over-literal interpretation” of a passage found in the A�gulimāla Theragāthā, Th 868: “having heard
鬘 髻
其額


Chapter 9 Rāja-vagga                                        -  491


The Pāli commentary explains that when a great crowd complained to the king about
A�gulimāla’s murderous activities, A�gulimāla’s father realized that this robber must
be his son. A�gulimāla’s mother thereupon decided to approach her son and fetch him,
before the king would capture him. In order to prevent A�gulimāla from killing his
own mother and thereby committing a crime that would have barred him from reaching
any of the stages of awakening, the Buddha decided to approach A�gulimāla himself.
A�gulimāla’s mother also takes part in the Ekottarika-āgama version and in one of
the individual translations, as well as in the Chinese Udāna-(varga) tale. According to
these three versions, A�gulimāla’s mother had come to bring her son some food. [245] As
A�gulimāla lacked only one more finger to make up the number of victims required, he
decided to kill his mother. In the individual translation, his willingness to kill his own
mother is related to the circumstance that the sun is about to set and, in order to follow
his teacher’s command, he had to accomplish his murderous feat within a single day. [246]
According to the Ekottarika-āgama discourse and the individual translation, A�gulimāla had already gotten hold of his mother when the Buddha intervened. [247] The individual translation relates that the Buddha suddenly appeared in front of A�gulimāla,
while according to the Ekottarika-āgama version the Buddha emanated a great light
that illuminated the whole forest. The Ekottarika-āgama account reports that A�gulimāla was alarmed by this great light and asked his mother to explain what was taking
place. In reply, she told him that the source of this light could only be the Buddha.
When A�gulimāla heard this he was full of joy, as his teacher had told him that by
killing the Buddha he would be reborn in heaven. [248] He told his mother to wait for a
moment, as he would just kill the Buddha and then partake of the meal she had brought. [249]

Schmidt 1843: 242,16 report the same.
246 This suggestion does not sit too well with the same version’s account in T 118 at T II 509a9, according
to which begging monks witnessed people complaining to the king about A�gulimāla’s deeds. Monks
have to partake of their food before noon, so that for them to hear peoples’ complaints would have to
have taken place during the early hours of the day, the time when they approach the town to beg alms.
This would imply that within a few hours of the same day on which A�gulimāla began his murderous
activities rumours of his deeds spread, people realized that they were unable to handle this situation on
their own and decided to approach the city to complain to the king. Even with considerable imagination, this seems to be putting too much into too short a time period.
247 [[EA38.6]] at T II 719c21 and T 118 at T II 509a24. T 202 at T IV 424a19 and Schmidt 1843: 243,5, as
well as the Maitrisimit in Tekin 1980: 162, also report that A�gulimāla was about to kill his mother and
only let go of her to kill the Buddha.
248 [[EA38.6]] at T II 720a7. Xuánzàng’s ( ) travel records in T 2087 at T LI 899a24, translated in Beal
1884/2001b: 3, report a version of the A�gulimāla tale that similarly depicts him about to kill his
mother and then rejoicing at the prospective of being able to kill the Buddha instead, as according to
A�gulimāla’s teacher this would lead to a heavenly rebirth.
249 [[EA38.6]] at T II 720a9. T 212 at T IV 703c9 also reports that A�gulimāla thought of coming back for his
meal after killing the monk he had seen, whom in this version he had not recognized to be the Buddha.
玄奘


492   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


MN II 99  At this point the narrative threads of the different versions come together again, as all
versions describe that A�gulimāla was unable to catch up with the Buddha even though
the latter was walking at a slow pace. The Udāna-(varga) account explains that the
Buddha accomplished this feat by magically contracting the earth where A�gulimāla
was and expanding the earth where the Buddha was himself. [250]
According to the Majjhima-nikāya discourse and one individual translation, A�gulimāla was surprised at being unable to catch up with the Buddha, as he was usually able
to catch even an elephant, a horse, or a chariot. [251] These descriptions of A�gulimāla’s
abilities again show a tendency to exaggeration, since for a human being to be strong
enough to catch an elephant or fast enough to catch up with a horse is hard to imagine.
According to the Pāli and Chinese discourses, the Sanskrit fragments, and the Udāna-(varga) account, A�gulimāla told the Buddha to stop. The Buddha replied that he
had already stopped, whereas A�gulimāla had not yet stopped. [252]
This riddle caused A�gulimāla to reflect and request an explanation. In reply, the
Buddha explained that, whereas he had stopped harming other beings, [253] A�gulimāla
was without restraint and hence in need of stopping.


250 T 212 at T IV 703c11: “the Buddha used his magical power so that where ‘Harmless’ [i.e. A�gulimāla]
was, the earth suddenly contracted, [whereas] the earth [where] the Buddha was became broad and
spread out, so that [A�gulimāla] became very tired and could not reach the Buddha”,
. Ps III 332,10 somewhat similarly describes how the
Buddha used his magical power to influence the earth in such a way that A�gulimāla was unable to
catch up with him.
251 [[MN86]] at MN II 99,12: “formerly I could catch up and seize a running elephant, catch up and seize a
running horse, or catch up and seize a racing chariot” (followed by also mentioning a running deer),
pubbe hatthim pi dhāvanta� anupatitvā ga�hāmi, assam pi dhāvanta� anupatitvā ga�hāmi, ratham pi
dhāvanta� anupatitvā ga�hāmi (S [e] -MN II 479,15 reads hatthi�, assa�, and ratha�) and T 119 at T II
510c20: “I can run and seize an elephant, or reach a horse, or reach a chariot” (followed by also mentioning an ox and a man), . His prowess in matters of speed recurs
also at a later point in the Ekottarika-āgama version, being part of A�gulimāla’s reflection after the 佛以神力令彼
無害在地頓縮, Buddha had spoken to him, cf. [[EA38.6]] at T II 720b 佛地寬舒, 如是疲極不能及佛 12: “at the time of running, I can reach an elephant,
a horse, or a chariot” (followed by also mentioning a man), . According
to Th-a III 55,24, A�gulimāla had the strength of seven elephants, and according to the “discourse on
the wise and the fool”, A�gulimāla’s strength was such that he was able to resist a thousand men, T 202
at T IV 423c22: and Schmidt 1843: 239,14: gcig pus mi stong thub pa.
252 [[MN86]] at MN II 99,18, [[SA1077]] at T II 280c27, [[SA2]] 16 at T II 378b25, [[EA38.6]] at T II 720a18, T 118

253 The “discourse on the wise and the fool 我走能逮象, ” differs from the other versions in so far as its treatment of the 亦能及馬, 亦能及車
topic of “stopping” contrasts the Buddha’s self-control with A�gulimāla’s mental agitation. Thus, in T 202
at T IV 424a23 the Buddha points out that: “I have calmed my faculties ... your mind is shaky and does
not reach stability, [as you] day and night kill and harm, committing innumerable sins 我奔走之時, 能及象, 馬, ” 車乘, ...
,, a contrast found similarly in the Tibetan version in Schmidt
1843: 243,10: nga’i dbang po rnams ni rtag tu zhi zhing ting nge ’dzin ... khyod kyis sems kyang bslus
te mi sdod pas, nyin mtshan du gsod pa’i las byed de, sdig pa mtha’ med pa’i las byed do. 力敵千人 This contrast
would suit the ensuing transformation of A�gulimāla well. According to Harris 1990/1994: 36, due to

Chapter 9 Rāja-vagga                                        -  493


The Majjhima-nikāya discourse and one of the individual translations present this reply by the Buddha in a single stanza, [254] while the Ekottarika-āgama version and the
other individual translation have the same in two stanzas. [255] The two Sa�yukta-āgama
versions, which in all other respects present by far the briefest account, report the Buddha’s reply in five or six stanzas, explaining in detail in what sense he had stopped and
A�gulimāla had not yet stopped. [256]
From the perspective of the discourse as a whole, this more detailed treatment seems
quite to the point, since the words spoken by the Buddha at this moment converted A�gulimāla from a criminal, ready to kill the Buddha, to a repentant desiring to become a
monk. In fact, later Buddhist traditions tend to consider this act of conversion as the climax of the whole story and its most prominent feature. [257]
The Pāli and Chinese discourses report that A�gulimāla acknowledged the truth of
the Buddha’s exposition, [258] threw away his weapons, and requested to be ordained,


the words spoken by the Buddha, “A�gulimāla is forced into the realization that his life has been a futile
chase, a fretful searching, without peace and fulfilment. The tranquillity of the Buddha contrasts sharply
with his own turbulence and the destructive state of his mind. The contrast makes him see the nature of
his mind. A revolution  - in its true sense of a complete turning around  - takes place”.
254 [[MN86]] at MN II 99,29 and T 119 at T II 511a1; cf. also Th 867.
255 [[EA38.6]] at T II 720a24 and T 118 at T II 509b9. [[EA38.6]] continues with A�gulimāla’s reflection after
hearing these two stanzas, reporting that he knew that Tathāgatas arise only rarely in the world and that
he even had some idea of what a Tathāgata would teach.
256 [[SA1077]] at T II 281a4 and [[SA2]] 16 at T II 378c2. SHT I 160cR1-3 also has several stanzas similar to the
two Sa�yukta-āgama versions. The Udāna-(varga) account, which has only a single stanza, nevertheless specifies that this should be supplemented with what is found in detail in the respective discourse, T
212 at T IV 703c20:, thereby indicating that the Buddha’s treatment of the topic of “stopping” was longer than the single stanza it quotes.
257 References in other works to A�gulimāla tend to highlight in particular the Buddha’s ability to transform
him, cf., e.g., the Avadānaśataka in Speyer 1906/1970: 148,9 or in Vaidya 1958a: 68,20 and in T 200 at
T IV 215a24, or the Sanskrit fragments of a buddhastotra in Schlingloff 1955: 104; for further references
cf. Hartmann 1998: 353-355 and Skilling 1997a: 297 note 111. Schlingloff 1988a: 229 describes a representation of the A�gulimāla tale from Aja��ā where “A�gulimāla appears before the Buddha twice; once
rushing towards him to attack and then bowed at his feet”. This contrast highlights the present turn of
events and the Buddha’s ability to tame and convert a ferocious brigand. On Amarāvatī sculptures depicting aspects of the tale of A�gulimāla cf., e.g., Sivaramamurti 1942/1956: 191-193; for Gandhāran
representations cf., e.g., Foucher 1918: 12 figure 304 and Kurita 1988: 227-229, plates 471-476. 廣說如契經偈
258 Gombrich 1996: 151-152 suggests to emend the first line of A�gulimāla’s stanza in [[MN86]] at MN II
100,1: mahesi (B [e] -MN II 303,5, C [e] -MN II 518,27, and S [e] -MN II 480,14: mahesī) to maheso. Based on
this emendation, he concludes that A�gulimāla could have been a “proto-Śaiva/Śākta” and that “his
practice of collecting fingers for a necklace is thus sure to be the result of a vow, in which the worshipper tries to attain the iconic form of his god”. A relation between A�gulimāla and Śivaism has also been
suggested by Eitel 1888/2004: 13, who s.v. Angulimālīya speaks of a “Śivaitic sect of fanatics who practiced assassination as a religious act. One of them was converted by Śākyamuni”, by Legge 1886/1998:
56 note 2, who suggests that “the A�gulimālya were a sect of Śivaitic fanatics, who made assassination a
religious act”, and by Soothill 1937/2000: 454, who under the entry speaks of a “Śivaitic sect
that wore ... chaplets” of finger-bones. Maithrimurthi 1998: 170 and 173 points out that “there seems to
be no testimony at all in the history of Indian religions to the practice of killing for decorating oneself

which the Buddha readily granted. [259] According to one of the individual translations,
A�gulimāla’s hair and beard magically disappeared, a miracle also recorded in the Pāli
commentary. [260] The Ekottarika-āgama account relates that, after granting A�gulimāla’s
request for ordination, the Buddha spoke a stanza of encouragement, on hearing of
which A�gulimāla reached stream-entry. [261]
The two Sa�yukta-āgama versions report that A�gulimāla became an arahant and
conclude with a set of verses spoken by him. The two individual translations similarly
record his attainment of full awakening at this point, while the Majjhima-nikāya and
Ekottarika-āgama versions turn to the same at a later point of their narration. [262]
Unlike the two Sa�yukta-āgama discourses, the Majjhima-nikāya and Ekottarikaāgama versions and the two individual translations record several additional events related to A�gulimāla. One of these events begins with King Pasenadi who, on his way
to catch A�gulimāla, paid a visit to the Buddha. According to the Ekottarika-āgama
version and one of the individual translations, Pasenadi had in fact visited the Buddha
to get advice on how to best undertake his mission. [263]
The Pāli commentary explains that Pasenadi was too afraid to set out straight away to
catch A�gulimāla and wanted to report the matter to the Buddha in order to find out if
he was going to be victorious. In case the Buddha should warn him, indicating that the
brigand will defeat him, then Pasenadi would have a good reason for not setting out on
his mission. [264] According to the Chinese Udāna-(varga) account, however, King Pase
with parts of the victim’s body” and explains that such a proto-Śaiva/Śākta cult would considerably
antedate “other known practitioners of Śaivic tantrism”. The respective readings in the parallels are: [[SA1077]] at T II 281a16: “sage”,, SĀ [2] 16 at T II 378c15: “such a man”,, [[EA38.6]] at T II 720b16:
“venerable one”,, T 118 at T II 509b13: “great sage”,, T 119 at T II 511a5: “recluse”,, and
T 212 at T IV 704a6: “great sage”, . Thus, none of the Chinese versions supports the assumption
that A�gulimāla’s stanza could have referred to Śiva.
259 [[MN86]] at MN II 100,9, [[SA1077]] at T II 281a21, [[SA2]] 16 at T II 378c23, and T 119 at T II 511a8 present
this information in verse form, a verse obviously spoken by the narrator of the discourse. [[EA38.6]] at T II
720b18 has A�gulimāla’s reaction still in verse, but the Buddha’s granting of ordination in prose, and T
118 at T II 509b15 has this whole part in prose.
260 T 119 at T II 511a10 and Ps III 334,13.
261 [[EA38.6]] at T II 720b23: “[as] you now have a shaven head, it is appropriate [for] you to discard the fetters, the eradication of the fetters 牟尼 yields great fruit, there will be no further 如此人 sadness and vexation”,
尊 . T 202 大聖 at T IV 424a29 and its Tibetan counterpart 沙門 in
Schmidt 1843: 243,17 also locate A�gulimāla’s 大聖 stream-entry at this point of events, followed by reporting that soon after he became an arahant, cf. T 202 a T IV 424b3 and Schmidt 1843: 244,1.
262 T 118 at T II 509b23 and T 119 at T II 511a19. In the case of T 119, this placement of his full awakening
meets with an inner inconsistency, as later on in T 119 at T II 511c27 the Buddha instructs A�gulimāla
“not to develop evil thoughts”,, after he had been attacked by people while begging. If A�gulimāla had already been an arahant when this happened, there would have been no need for him to be
instructed in this way.

nadi had heard that the killer he wanted to capture had become a monk in the meantime.
Pasenadi then decided to approach the Buddha in order to ascertain if this was true. [265]
According to the Majjhima-nikāya and Ekottarika-āgama versions, as well as the individual translations, the Buddha told King Pasenadi that A�gulimāla had become a
monk and was sitting close by. [266] All versions report that the sight of A�gulimāla instilled fear in the king. [267]
After overcoming his fear, Pasenadi approached A�gulimāla and offered to support
him with requisites. [268] According to the Majjhima-nikāya discourse, A�gulimāla refused, [269] as he had undertaken the ascetic practices of begging and wearing rag robes. [270]
The Majjhima-nikāya and Ekottarika-āgama versions, as well as the individual translations, conclude their narration of this event with King Pasenadi’s admiration of the Buddha’s ability to tame A�gulimāla.
The Ekottarika-āgama discourse next describes that A�gulimāla, by dint of practising in seclusion, became an arahant endowed with the six supernormal knowledges. [271]
The Majjhima-nikāya discourse turns to his attainment of full liberation only after reporting his intervention on behalf of a woman in labour.
The Majjhima-nikāya and Ekottarika-āgama versions, as well as the two individual
translations, record this intervention in similar terms, describing that, while begging


265 T 212 at T IV 704b7.
266 [[EA38.6]] at T II 720c14 and T 119 at T II 511b9 additionally specify that A�gulimāla was seated in meditation. According to [[MN86]] at MN II 101,3, when the king arrived, the Buddha inquired if Pasenadi had
been attacked by other kings, a question not recorded in the Chinese versions.
267 For King Pasenadi to find himself suddenly confronted with A�gulimāla in a situation where the king is
not accompanied by his soldiers could indeed arouse fear, all the more since according to T 119 at T II
511a27 he had put aside his royal insignia, among them also his sword, before approaching the Buddha.
Although the other versions do not explicitly mention his putting aside the sword, the same action can be
assumed to be implicit in their report that he approached the Buddha, as it is customary conduct for a
king when approaching a religious teacher to divest himself of his royal insignia, cf., e.g., [[MN89]] at MN
II 119,27 and its parallels [[MA213]] at T I 795c12, T 1451 at T XXIV 237a27, and D (6) ’dul ba, tha 82b7
or Q (1035) de 79b5. For a listing of the five insignia in a similar situation cf. also the Divyāvadāna in
Cowell 1886: 147,12 or Vaidya 1999: 91,12 (cf. also Upreti 1995: 106); an enumeration of the five insignia of a king can also be found in the Jain �hā�a�ga 5.408 in Jambūvijaya 1985: 182,5.
268 Harvey 2009b: 58 notes that “once A�gulimāla was reformed by the Buddha, the king saw no reason to
punish him ... he would respect him [as a monk], rather than seek to drive him from his kingdom”.
269 [[MN86]] at MN II 102,14. According to [[EA38.6]] at T II 720c23, after the king’s offer A�gulimāla “remained silent without answering”,, which in the discourses is a standard way of expressing
acceptance. T 118 at T II 509c14 reports that the king left A�gulimāla after having “received approval”,
, which also gives the impression that A�gulimāla accepted the offer. Yet, [[EA38.6]] at T II 721a1
and T 118 at T II 509c19 report that A�gulimāla had undertaken the practice of begging and wearing rag
robes, ascetic practices that would not be compatible with accepting the king’s offer. T 119 at T II 511b18
also mentions the king’s offer, but does not record how A�gulimāla reacted.
270 [[MN86]] at MN II 102,12. [[EA38.6]] at T II 721a1, T 118 at T II 509c19, and T 119 at T II 551a20 similarly
note that A�gulimāla subsisted by begging alms and wearing rag robes.
271 [[EA38.6]] at T II 721a7. T 118 at T II 509b23 and T 212 at T IV 704b4 also record that A�gulimāla had attained the six supernormal knowledges.

alms in town, A�gulimāla saw a woman in birth difficulties. According to one of the
individual translations, the woman even addressed A�gulimāla and asked him for relief
from her difficulties. [272] The Chinese Udāna-(varga) presents a variation to this tale, as
it reports that the problem was not a woman in birth difficulties, but a female elephant in
labour. [273]

MN II 103  According to the Majjhima-nikāya account, A�gulimāla reported what he had seen to
the Buddha, whereon the Buddha told him to declare in front of the woman that, since his
birth, he had never deprived a living being of life, wishing her well by the strength of
this asseveration of truth. A�gulimāla objected that in this way he would be speaking a
falsehood. In reply to this objection, the Buddha reformulated the statement, suggesting he should declare that since his “noble” birth, i.e., since his going forth, he had
never consciously deprived a living being of life. [274]
One of the individual translations agrees with the Majjhima-nikāya presentation on
the Buddha’s first proposition and on A�gulimāla’s objection. According to this individual translation, in reply to A�gulimāla’s objection the Buddha explained that this
statement was meant to refer to A�gulimāla’s “birth” as a monk, so that it was not a
falsehood. A�gulimāla then made his actual asseveration of truth without using the
qualification “noble”, simply asserting that since his birth he had not killed a single
being. [275]
According to the other individual translation, however, the Buddha used the qualification “noble” already in his first proposition. A�gulimāla nevertheless objected, apparently because he had not realized the implication of the expression “noble birth”. [276]
The Ekottarika-āgama version also reports that the Buddha used the qualification “noble” already in his first proposition. A�gulimāla apparently straightaway understood


272 T 118 at T II 509c21.
273 T 212 at T IV 704a11. The Chinese version of the “discourse on the wise and the fool”, T 202 at T IV
424b5, also introduces A�gulimāla’s asseveration of truth by reporting an elephant in labour,, while
its Tibetan counterpart in Schmidt 1843: 244,4 speaks instead of a cow, ba lang mo. The Dhammapada
commentary Dhp-a III 185,16 provides another relation between A�gulimāla and an elephant, narrating
that, during a meal offering, King Pasenadi had elephants stationed near each monk. The elephant that
had been placed close to A�gulimāla was untrained and fierce, yet due to the power of A�gulimāla it
remained perfectly calm.

whereas the earlier statement in [[MN86]] at MN II 103,13 reads yato aha�, bhagini, jāto (B [e] -MN II 306,30
and C [e] -MN II 524 note 2 record a variant reading of the Buddha’s first instruction as yato aha� bhagini
jātiyā jāto). Masefield 1992: 306 note 12 sees the notion of a noble birth as “equivalent to the 象 upanayana rite, the second ‘birth’of the twice born var�as”.
275 T 118 at T II 510a3: “from birth until now”, . The Udāna-(varga), T 212 at T IV 704a21, reports a similar asseveration of truth, which in its case helped the elephant out of its difficulties. A reference to this proclamation occurs also in the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, T 1428 at T XXII 568b19: “being
‘born’ from the Buddha’s discipline, you are then truly ‘born’, just like A�gulimāla”,
.

what was meant, as he did not object to the Buddha’s proposition. [277] Hence in these
two versions, just as in the Majjhima-nikāya account, A�gulimāla’s actual asseveration
of truth claims harmless conduct since his “noble” birth.
The Pāli commentary explains that A�gulimāla found it difficult to obtain food when
begging, since people were too afraid to approach him. [278] In order to ameliorate this situation, the Buddha had instructed A�gulimāla to proclaim publicly in an asseveration of
truth that he had completely given up his former murderous conduct and no longer
harmed any living beings.
In line with the commentary’s suggestion that A�gulimāla’s appearance as a begging
monk led to fear and negative reactions among the population, the Pāli Vinaya reports
that the going forth of A�gulimāla had caused an uproar among the people. This then
made the Buddha promulgate a rule against ordaining such brigands in the future. [279]
The Pāli and Chinese discourses agree that A�gulimāla’s asseveration of truth proved
its worth in helping the woman to overcome her difficulties. [280] For an asseveration of
truth to have its effect, A�gulimāla’s proclamation would have to be worded in terms
of “noble birth”.
If his proclamation had been worded only in terms of “birth”, as reported in one of
the individual translations, this would have been a falsehood. Making a mental comment to himself that with “birth” only “ordination” is meant would not solve this problem, since everyone who hears this proclamation would understand it to refer to physical birth. [281] Only once the qualification “noble” is added to the statement would A�gulimāla’s proclamation no longer be a falsehood and thereby become invested with


277 [[EA38.6]] at T II 721a20: “since my noble birth”, .
278 Ps III 338,8.
279 The regulation in Vin I 74,34 prohibits ordaining a “robber who wears an emblem”, dhajabaddho coro.
Horner 1951/1982: 93 note 1 comments that “it is difficult to reconcile the above Vinaya ruling with the
story of A�gulimāla’s going forth”, as recorded in [[MN86]] Yet, the introduction to this rule in Vin I 74,26
speaks of A�gulimāla, qualified as a cora, which leaves little doubt that the same person must be meant.
Perhaps the rationale behind this rule is that, while the Buddha’s decision to ordain A�gulimāla was
based on an assessment of the latter’s potential, other monks might not have such knowledge. In view of
the repercussions that such an ordination can cause among the laity, this rule could have been intended
to prevent other monks from imitating the Buddha’s action by indiscriminately ordaining criminals.
280 His asseveration of truth has become a well-known 我從賢聖生已來 protective chant, a paritta, already referred to in Mil
151,1 as the A�gulimālaparitta and still in use today, cf., e.g., Spiro 1970/1982: 146.
281 The Buddha’s paradoxical reply to A�gulimāla at their initial meeting, in which he proclaims that he has
stopped while A�gulimāla has not yet stopped, differs in this respect. Although the statement in [[MN86]]
at MN II 99,18: �hito aha�, “I am standing”, is contrary to the real situation, as the Buddha is still walking,
this proclamation does not have a potential to deceive. For A�gulimāla, it would have been immediately
clear that the Buddha is still walking, making it self-evident that this proclamation is not intended literally, as can be seen by the circumstance that A�gulimāla immediately requests an explanation of its
meaning. The enigmatic nature of the Buddha’s statement is also highlighted by Kalupahana 2002: 124,
who compares it to a “kung-an (koan) ... given to a disciple by a Ch’an (Zen) master”. A�gulimāla’s
proclamation that since his birth he had never deprived a living being of life, however, would not necessarily have been a similarly self-evident riddle to anyone who heard it.


498   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


the transformative potential that ancient Indian thought apparently attributed to an asseveration of truth. [282]
As according to the commentarial explanation the purpose of A�gulimāla’s declaration of truth was to assure the inhabitants of Sāvatthī that he was no longer dangerous,
it is also not clear why the Buddha should at first instruct A�gulimāla to make a proclamation that is not true and thus would not have this effect, as reported in the Majjhima-nikāya version. According to the Majjhima-nikāya discourse, it was only after A�gulimāla’s objection that the Buddha reformulated the asseveration of truth in such a
way that it was indeed true and thereby could have the effect for which it was meant.
The Majjhima-nikāya version’s presentation would imply that the Buddha instructed
one of his disciples to speak what does to some degree amount to a falsehood, which
would stand in contrast to the types of speech a Buddha would use according to other
discourses. [283] At an earlier point, the A�gulimāla-sutta itself in fact explicitly states that
a Buddhist monk does not speak falsehood. [284]
The account given in the Ekottarika-āgama version and in one of the individual translations avoids such difficulties, as according to these versions the Buddha straightaway
uses the formulation “noble birth”, so that the question of speaking a falsehood does
not arise in the first place.
Against the background information provided in the Pāli commentary, it would also
fit the situation better if the Buddha were to phrase his instruction right away with the
qualification “noble”, as on hearing such a proclamation people in town might indeed
have felt reassured that A�gulimāla’s conduct had changed.
That A�gulimāla’s proclamation of truth was aimed at the population in general is
particularly evident in the individual translation, according to which the Buddha told
A�gulimāla that he should deliver an exposition on the five precepts and their karmic
fruits in the streets of the town before approaching the woman and making his declaration of truth. [285]
Even with the qualification “noble” the declaration of truth has a riddle-like effect, as
can be seen in the individual translation according to which A�gulimāla at first did not
understand the implications of the expression “noble birth”. Hence, this formulation is
startling enough to cause those who hear it to ponder over its meaning. In sum, given
the narrative setting, the use of the qualification “noble” right from the outset would
better fit the context.

282 On the notion of an asseveration of truth and its effect cf. Brown 1968, id. 1972a, id. 1972b, Burlingame

and Zimmer 1951: 160-169; on the same in relation to maitri cf. Schmithausen 1997.
283 [[MN58]] at MN I 395,7 clarifies that the Buddha will only speak what is true. [[DN16]] at DN II 73,3 (= [[AN7.20]] at AN IV 18,2), [[MN87]] at MN II 108,12, [[AN7.26]] at AN II 24,5, and It 4:112 at It 122,1 confirm

Chapter 9 Rāja-vagga                                        -  499


The next event related in the A�gulimāla-sutta, an event recorded also in the Ekotta- MN II 104
rika-āgama discourse, the two individual translations, and the Chinese Udāna-(varga),
confirms the impression that the asseveration of truth may have been intended to ameliorate the negative attitude of the population towards A�gulimāla. The Pāli and Chinese versions narrate that on one occasion people went so far as to throw sticks and
stones at A�gulimāla, so that he came back from begging food with torn robes and a
bleeding head. The Udāna-(varga) explains that the people who attacked him had lost
some of their close relatives due to A�gulimāla’s former murderous activities. [286] The
Majjhima-nikāya and Ekottarika-āgama versions and one of the individual translations
report that the Buddha told A�gulimāla that he should patiently bear the fruits of his
deeds, which could have led to his suffering for many future life times. [287]
The Pāli and Chinese discourses record a set of stanzas spoken by A�gulimāla, stanzas found also in the A�gulimāla Theragāthā. [288] While in the Majjhima-nikāya version
these stanzas were spoken by A�gulimāla when he was alone in seclusion, according to
the Ekottarika-āgama account and the individual translations he spoke them in the Buddha’s presence. [289]
The Majjhima-nikāya version begins with three stanzas that revolve around the image of a moon in a sky free from clouds. The first stanza employs this image to illustrate overcoming negligence, the second stanza applies it to doing what is wholesome
instead of what is evil, and in the third stanza this image illustrates how a young monk
energetically applies himself to the Buddha’s teaching. [290] While all three stanzas recur

286 T 212 at T IV 704a27. A somewhat similar story can be found in the Jain Antaga�adasāo, translated in
Barnett 1907/1973: 91, where a Jain monk on his begging tour is attacked by relatives of his former victims. As a layman, he had been a garland-maker and had killed numerous people due to being possessed
by a spirit. On one occasion, however, he was unable to get close to his prospective victim, who was a
Jain disciple. Thereon the spirit left him and he went forth as a Jain monk, eventually reaching full liberation. The parallelism of several aspects of this tale to the story of A�gulimāla is remarkable.
287 [[MN86]] at MN II 104,13, [[EA38.6]] at T II 721a28, and T 119 at T II 511c27. T 118 does not record the
Buddha’s admonition, but turns directly to A�gulimāla’s verses. According to the Udāna-(varga) account, T 212 at T IV 704b3, when A�gulimāla came back bleeding and with torn requisites, the Buddha
gave him a long exposition that caused him to attain all four stages of awakening together with the six
supernormal knowledges. The Udāna-(varga)’s sequence of narration differs from the other versions, as
it has the episode with King Pasenadi only at this point, i.e., after A�gulimāla had made the asseveration
of truth, had been attacked while going begging, and become an arahant.

290 [[MN86]] at MN II 104,21. The first of these three stanzas, which recurs at [[DHP|DHP172]] and Th 871, has parallels in the Gāndhārī Dharmapada stanza 122 in Brough 1962/2001: 136, in the Patna Dharmapada stanza 20 in Cone 1989: 109 or in Roth 1980b: 99, in T 213 at T IV 785a25, and in the Sanskrit and Tibetan
Udāna-(varga) stanza 16:5 in Bernhard 1965: 225 (cf. also stanza 189 in Nakatani 1987: 46) and in
Beckh 1911: 53 or in Zongtse 1990: 165. The second stanza, which recurs at [[DHP|DHP173]] and Th 872, has a
parallel in the Pravrajyāvastu of the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, cf. Dutt 1984d: 56,6 and Näther 1975:

and in the Sanskrit and Tibetan Udāna-(varga) stanza 16:9 in Bernhard 1965: 226 and in Beckh 1911:

in one of the Sa�yukta-āgama versions, the other Sa�yukta-āgama version has only
the stanza on doing what is wholesome instead of what is evil. [291] The Ekottarika-āgama version and one of the individual translations have only the other two stanzas, which
apply the image of the moon free from clouds to no longer doing evil and to a young
monk’s practice of the Buddha’s teaching. [292]
The stanza on overcoming former evil by doing what is wholesome stands at the
heart of the Udāna-(varga) account of A�gulimāla, according to which this poetic
declaration forms part of the Buddha’s reply to King Pasenadi’s inquiry as to how a
mass murderer could possibly become an arahant. [293]
The Majjhima-nikāya version continues with stanzas expressing A�gulimāla’s wish
that his enemies might hear the Dharma and develop patience, as then they would not
wish to harm him. [294] The same topic is taken up in one of the Sa�yukta-āgama versions, according to which A�gulimāla highlighted his practice of patience towards those
who feel resentment towards him. [295]
This is noteworthy, since even though this Sa�yukta-āgama version does not record
A�gulimāla’s experience of being attacked while begging alms, the way the stanza is
formulated implies an accident of this kind. The Ekottarika-āgama version and the individual translations, in contrast, do not have such a stanza, even though they earlier
related that A�gulimāla had been attacked while begging alms.
Hence, the fact that the Sa�yukta-āgama versions do not mention certain events recorded in the A�gulimāla-sutta and the other Chinese versions does not necessarily
mean that these tales were not known to the Sa�yukta-āgama reciters. Perhaps the reciters that transmitted this Sa�yukta-āgama collection knew of these stories as a sepa

Tibetan Udāna-(varga) stanza 16:7 in Bernhard 1965: 226 (cf. also stanza 191 in Nakatani 1987: 46) and
in Beckh 1911: 54 or in Zongtse 1990: 165.

former negligence that, however, does not employ the moon imagery.
292 [[EA38.6]] at T II 721b17+21 and T 119 at T II 512a14+16. [[EA38.6]] repeats these two stanzas with a change
of image, as it speaks additionally also of the sun that is free from clouds (the second of these two stanzas, however, has the moon as a and variant reading for the sun). T 118 at T II 510a24 +26 takes up
this alternative theme and illustrates overcoming former negligence and no longer doing evil with a sunrise unobstructed by clouds, while in the case of a young monk who energetically practises the Buddha’s
teaching this version uses the image of the full moon, without referring to the absence of the clouds.
293 T 212 at T IV 704b25. Dhp-a III 170,9 also quotes this stanza in relation to A�gulimāla, although according to its report the question about A�gulimāla’s ability to become an arahant arose after his death and
was posed by other monks.
294 [[MN86]] at MN II 104,27.
295 The reference to those who feel resentment towards A�gulimāla occurs in [[SA1077]] at T II 281b25 and is
followed in [[SA1077]] at T II 281b27 by: “because of receiving the Buddha’s kindness and strength, I have
loving kindness and practise forbearance, 元 明 and always praise patience”,
(adopting the and variant reading instead of ). According to SĀ [2] 16 at T II 379a21,
A�gulimāla similarly said: “people, who get [to hear] my words, [may they] all discard the bondage of
resentment [from their] mind”, .

rate discourse, or as part of their respective commentaries. The two Sa�yukta-āgama
versions are rather brief and most of their presentation is in verse. This suggests them to
be comparable to the A�gulimāla Theragāthā. The Theragāthā account also refers to
several events from A�gulimāla’s life only implicitly, without giving the full tale, a
tale narrated in full only in its commentary.
The Majjhima-nikāya version continues with two stanzas that compare abilities in
various crafts to the wise who tame themselves, [296] followed by proclaiming that A�gulimāla had been tamed without external force. [297] Similar stanzas occur in the Sa�yukta-āgama and Ekottarika-āgama versions, as well as in the individual translations. [298]
Another Pāli stanza highlights that A�gulimāla already now experienced the fruits of
his evil deeds. The Sa�yukta-āgama version reports the same, thereby again suggesting that the story of how he was attacked while going begging was at the background
of its verses. [299]
The Pāli version concludes with A�gulimāla’s proclamation that he had reached the
goal, a proclamation found at an earlier point also in the Chinese versions. [300] The Ekottarika-āgama discourse and one of the individual translations continue after these stanzas by reporting that the Buddha declared A�gulimāla to be foremost in understanding
quickly. [301] This declaration could refer to his swift comprehension at the time of his
conversion. According to the Ekottarika-āgama version, the Buddha continued by narrating a former life of A�gulimāla at the time of Kassapa Buddha, explaining that those
who in his present life had become his victims had killed him in that former life. [302]

these two stanzas recurs in Th 9, spoken by the monk Pilindavaccha. A similar stanza can be found in
the Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1977: 156,7: svāgata� te vyavasita�, naitad duścintita� tvayā, pravibhakte�u dharme�u, yac chre��ha� tad upāgama, here spoken by the Buddha.

502   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


Looking back on the A�gulimāla-sutta and its parallels, it is noteworthy that this discourse is an extended narration with relatively few parts that purport to be direct speech
by the Buddha. [303] From the perspective of oral transmission, the A�gulimāla-sutta is
thus closer in kind to the narrative material found usually in the commentaries.
The somewhat commentarial character of major parts of the present discourses, together with the fascinating contrast between the bloody-handed brigand A�gulimāla
and the arahant monk A�gulimāla, may account for the considerable differences found
between the various versions and for the recurring tendency to exaggerate aspects of
the narration, a tendency evident in nearly all versions.
Despite all variations, the central message of the discourse remains the same, in that
it throws into relief the Buddha’s ability to transform even an abominable criminal into
a saint.


[[MN87]] Piyajātika-sutta

The Piyajātika-sutta, the “discourse on [the consequences that] arise from affection”,
explains why sorrow arises from those one holds dear. This discourse has a parallel in
the Madhyama-āgama, a parallel in the Ekottarika-āgama, a parallel in an individual
translation, and a fourth parallel in an Udāna-(varga) extant in Chinese. [304]


303 A word count of [[MN86]] indicates that only about 11% of the total text is presented as being spoken by
the Buddha, and even the total percentage of direct speech (including the use of direct speech to report
thoughts) only accounts for about 60% of the whole text. Compared to other discourses, this is a remarkably low percentage, since an average Majjhima-nikāya discourse will have an introduction and
conclusion section by the reciters, but the main body of the text will be almost entirely in direct speech.
This is even the case for predominantly narrative discourses, like for example [[MN81]] or [[MN83]] In [[MN81]] about 94% of the discourse is presented as being spoken by the Buddha (direct speech accounts for
about 96% of [[MN81]]), while in [[MN83]] about 96% of the whole discourse is presented as being spoken
by the Buddha (direct speech amounts to about 98% of [[MN83]]). Notably, in the case of [[MN81]] and [[MN83]] variations between the Chinese, Pāli, Sanskrit, and Tibetan versions are less prominent than in the
case of [[MN86]] and its parallels. This ties in with an observation made by von Simson 1977: 484, who
noticed that in texts of the Sarvāstivāda tradition there is a strong tendency to replace phrases of the type
yena ... tenopasa�krānta� with yena ... tenopajagāma. Yet, in places where this expression is used in
direct speech by the Buddha (i.e., the Buddha reports how someone came to see him) the old form remains. Von Simson concludes that this shows the respect the reciters had for what they perceived as the
word of the Buddha, which was kept in the old form, while parts of the discourses not held to have been
spoken by the Buddha could more easily be changed. The same respect may also account for the occurrence of less variations in the case of [[MN81]] or [[MN83]] where greater parts of the discourse were
considered to be original Buddha word, compared to the variations found in the case of [[MN86]] where
only a minor fraction of the discourse, about 11%, was reckoned to have been spoken by the Buddha.
304 The parallels are [[MA216]] at T I 800c-802a, [[EA13.3]] at T II 571b-572c, T 91 at T I 915a-916a, and T 212
at T IV 649c8-650a29. According to the information given in the Taishō edition, T 91 was translated by
Ān Shìgāo ( ). [[MA216]] [[EA13.3]] T 91, and T 212 agree with [[MN87]] on locating the discourse in
Jeta’s Grove by Sāvatthī. [[MA216]] has the title “discourse on [what] arises [from] affection”,,
while T 91 has the title “discourse spoken by the Buddha to a Brahmin who did not separate [himself]
from thoughts of affection for his dead son”, . The summary verse at T

The Piyajātika-sutta and its parallels begin by describing how a householder, who
was mourning the loss of his only son, approached the Buddha. [305] On seeing the householder’s condition, the Buddha commented that sorrow and grief arise from those one
holds dear. [306] According to the Piyajātika-sutta and its parallels, the householder disapproved of this proposition, got up and left. [307] He then repeated the Buddha’s comment
to some gamblers, who agreed with him that those one holds dear are rather a source of
happiness and delight.
Eventually King Pasenadi came to hear about this conversation and confronted Queen
Mallikā with the statement made by the Buddha. When she expressed her agreement
with the Buddha’s proposition, King Pasenadi was dissatisfied, as he took her facile
agreement to be a sign of blind submission to whatever her teacher said. [308] According


II 576a6 refers to [[EA13.3]] as, which could be a scribal error for, the name of the Brahmin sent
in [[EA13.3]] at T II 572a8 by Queen Mallikā to the Buddha. For a remark on [[MA216]] cf. Minh Chau 1964/
1991: 72. [[EA13.3]] has been translated by Huyen-Vi 1990: 81-86. The first part of the Piyajātika-sutta
recurs, moreover, in a Chinese Jātaka collection, in the fifteenth chapter of the “discourse on [former]
births”,, T 154 at T III 80c, which according to the Taishō edition was translated by Dharmarak�a,
cf. also Boucher 1996: 269.
305 While [[MN87]] at MN II 106,3 and [[EA13.3]] at T II 571b29 introduce the Buddha’s visitor as a “householder”, gahapati/, according to [[MA216]] at T I 800c22, T 91 at T I 915a8, and T 212 at T IV 649c8
he was a Brahmin, or .
306 While in [[MA216]] at T I 801a3, T 91 at T I 915a17, and T 212 at T IV 649c19 the Buddha’s remark is as
brief as in [[MN87]] at MN II 106, 竹膞 17, according to [[EA13.3]] at T II 571c10 竹膊 he spoke in more detail, explaining to the householder that “birth, old age, disease, and death are permanent conditions in the world, to
be separated from what one has affection is dukkha, to be together with what one dislikes is dukkha, the
loss of your son is [due to] impermanence”, . In
this way, 生經 [[EA13.3]] seems to draw out the implications of the short comment made by the Buddha in the
other versions, where he only gives a brief pointer to the first noble truth, in the sense that dissociation
from what is liked causes the arising of dukkha, cf., e.g., [[SN56.11]] at SN V 421,22: piyehi vippayogo
dukkho. A more detailed 長者 exposition of the same theme can be found in [[UD8.8]] at [[UD91.12]] This discourse starts with a 梵志 situation 婆羅門 similar to [[MN87]] as it records how Visākhā was mourning the death of a
grandson. The Buddha then asked Visākhā if she would like to have as many children as there were inhabitants in Sāvatthī. When she enthusiastically agreed, the Buddha made her realize that in Sāvatthī
every day someone passes away, so that on having so many children she would be in continuous mourning. He then concluded his exposition by proclaiming that those who hold a hundred dear will suffer a
hundred times, [[UD8.8]] at [[UD92.2]] while those 生老病死世之常法, who hold nothing 恩愛離苦, dear, will 怨憎會苦, not suffer, 子捨汝無常 [[UD8.8]] at [[UD92.16]] Another discourse in the same collection, [[UD2.7]] at [[UD14.20]] also takes up the theme of the loss
of someone’s only son and, similar to [[MN87]] recommends detachment from what is dear in order to
avoid being afflicted by grief.

307 While according to [[MN87]] at MN II 106,19 and T 212 at T IV 649c20 the householder expressed his disagreement once and then left, according to [[MA216]] at T I 801a7 and T 91 at T I 915a20 the Buddha repeated his statement three times, each time being contradicted by his visitor. According to [[EA13.3]] at T
II 571c13, the householder just left, without voicing his disagreement at all. In the version of this story
found in T 154 at T III 80c24, however, on hearing the Buddha’s proposition the householder suddenly
had an insight into impermanence. After taking the precepts from the Buddha, he bowed down and left,
apparently satisfied with the Buddha’s explanation, with which T 154 concludes.
308 While according to [[MN87]] at MN II 108,1 and [[EA13.3]] at T II 572a7 the king was displeased to the ex

to all versions, with the exception of the Chinese Udāna-(varga), a Brahmin was sent
to the Buddha to find out whether he had indeed stated that grief arises from those one
holds dear. [309]

MN II 108 The Buddha then illustrated his proposition to this Brahmin by describing how the
death of different family members had caused sorrow and grief to various people. [310] To
bring home the same point, he related a former case of suicide, which had been caused
by a woman’s relatives trying to separate her from her husband and marry her to someone else. The Ekottarika-āgama account indicates that the reason for wanting to remarry
her was that the husband had become poor. [311] All versions of this episode record that
the husband killed his wife and himself. The Majjhima-nikāya and Madhyama-āgama
versions indicate that he undertook this act in the hope that he and his wife would be
together in the next world. [312]

MN II 110  According to the Majjhima-nikāya and the Ekottarika-āgama versions, the Brahmin
reported the Buddha’s exposition to Queen Mallikā, whereas in the Madhyama-āgama
version and the individual translation he only confirmed to King Pasenadi that the Buddha attributed the arising of sorrow and grief to those one holds dear. The four discourse
versions continue by describing how Mallikā illustrated the Buddha’s statement to King
Pasenadi by asking him if he would feel sorrow or grief if something were to happen to
those close to him, to his subjects, or even to herself. Her eloquent presentation in front
of the king is also recorded in the Chinese Udāna-(varga). In each case, the king had to
agree that this would cause him sorrow and grief.
In the Majjhima-nikāya and Ekottarika-āgama versions, her exposition appears to be
based on what she had heard from the Brahmin whom she had sent to the Buddha. In
the Madhyama-āgama version and the individual translation, however, she has not yet


tent of asking Mallikā to leave, according to [[MA216]] at T I 801b4, T 91 at T I 915b14, and T 212 at T IV
650a7 the situation did not escalate up to this point.
309 While [[MN87]] at MN II 108,3 and [[EA13.3]] at T II 572a8 report that Mallikā dispatched the Brahmin,
according to [[MA216]] at T I 801b5 and T 91 at T I 915b14 Pasenadi dispatched the Brahmin, following a
suggestion made by Mallikā to verify the Buddha’s statement. T 212 at T IV 650a7 does not have the
episode with the Brahmin at all, as here Mallikā on her own engages the king in the question and answer
session that in the other versions she undertakes once the Brahmin has come back from his mission.
310 [[MN87]] at MN II 108,28 stands alone in working through the same set of family members twice, first from
the perspective of a woman who mourns the loss of various family members and then again from the
perspective of a man who mourns the loss of various family members. [[MA216]] at T I 801b19 and T 91 at
T I 915b28 just have a human being,, as the subject of their treatment, while [[EA13.3]] at T II 572a22
speaks of a householder, . Another difference is that while [[MN87]] and [[EA13.3]] present their various cases as actual happenings that took place in Sāvatthī, in [[MA216]] and T 91 these cases are not connected to any particular location.

however, he said: “we two will take hold of death together”,, and according to T 91 at T I
915c11 he said: “[we] shall leave together”, .

had a chance to hear the Buddha’s explanation, as all the Brahmin did on returning to
the palace was to confirm to Pasenadi and Mallikā that the statement attributed to the
Buddha had indeed been made by him, without relating the exposition the Buddha had
given to explain this statement. Thus in these versions, her exposition is based on her
own wisdom, as is the case in the Chinese Udāna-(varga), where no messenger was
sent to the Buddha at all.
The Majjhima-nikāya and Ekottarika-āgama versions record that Pasenadi formally
expressed his respect for the Buddha. [313] According to the Madhyama-āgama version,
the individual translation, and the Chinese Udāna-(varga), he even took refuge and declared himself to be a disciple of the Buddha. [314]


[[MN88]] Bāhitika-sutta [315]

The Bāhitika-sutta, the “discourse on the foreign cloth”, records King Pasenadi’s attempt to ascertain the Buddha’s moral integrity during a discussion with Ānanda. This
discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama. [316]
The Bāhitika-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel begin by describing that King
Pasenadi saw Ānanda from afar and inquired from his minister if this was indeed the
monk Ānanda. In the Madhyama-āgama version, Ānanda in a similar way also inquired


313 [[MN87]] at MN II 112,3 and [[EA13.3]] at T II 572c18. [[EA13.3]] continues by noting that King Pasenadi’s
esteem for Mallikā increased considerably after the explanation he had heard from her. According to
the same version, the Buddha came to hear of the conversation that had taken place between Pasenadi
and Mallikā and approved of her exposition, declaring her to be chief among his realized female lay
disciples for her firm faith, [[EA13.3]] at T II 572c27: . While the
list of eminent lay disciples in the A�guttara-nikāya does not mention Mallikā, its Ekottarika-āgama

the present study, cf. Anālayo 2007h. According to 我聲聞中, the commentarial 第一得證優婆斯, explanation 篤信牢固 at Ps III 347,13, this
cloth was called bāhitikā because it came from a foreign country, bāhitira��ha, an explanation followed
by Chalmers 1927: 61, who renders the term as “piece of foreign fabric”, and by Horner 1957/1970: 296,
who translates it as 供養如來 “foreign cloth”. PED: 486 s.v. bāhitikā, however, derives the word from bāheti, “to
ward off”, and suggests it to refer to a mantle or wrapper that “keeps out” the cold or the wind. This
bāhitikā was apparently of considerable size, as according to [[MN88]] at MN II 116,30 it measured sixteen
by eight, so�asasamā āyāmena a��hasamā vitthārena. The commentary, Ps III 347,15, explains these
measurements to refer to the cubit, an understanding also reflected in [[MA214]] at T I 799a22:
. Hence, this cloth would have been too large for serving as a mantle or wrapper. The same 鞞訶 size
提 would, however, suffice for making three robes, for which purpose according to both versions Pasenadi
offered it to Ānanda. Therefore it seems to me preferable to follow the commentarial explanation and
take bāhitikā to stand for a “foreign cloth”.

from another monk if the person they saw riding an elephant was indeed King Pasenadi,
an inquiry not recorded in the Majjhima-nikāya version.
In relation to this difference, someone not too well acquainted with the Buddhist monk
community might indeed be in doubt if a monk he sees at a distance is Ānanda. In contrast, it is more difficult to imagine that anyone could be uncertain about the identity of
the king of the country. Even if someone should never have seen King Pasenadi, the
very fact that the person he sees is riding an elephant, presumably wears emblems of a
king (such as turban, fly whisk, royal umbrella, etc.) and is accompanied by an entourage should make it evident that this is the king of the country. [317] Hence, the additional
inquiry found in the Madhyama-āgama could be an attempt to counterbalance the loss
of status incurred by Ānanda through not being immediately recognized by Pasenadi.
The two versions’ description of events does in fact show a recurring tendency to enhance Ānanda’s status. Thus according to the Madhyama-āgama account, King Pasenadi simply rode on his elephant close to Ānanda and in polite terms requested a meeting on the bank of the nearby river. According to the Majjhima-nikāya version, however, he at first sent a messenger to tell Ānanda that Pasenadi paid homage to him and
asked him to stop. Then Pasenadi came close on his elephant, dismounted the elephant,
and approached Ānanda on foot, paid homage, and politely asked for a meeting at the
bank of the river nearby. Once Ānanda had expressed his agreement, Pasenadi remounted his elephant to approach the riverbank, where he got down again from the elephant and again paid homage to Ānanda. This procedure seems rather complicated for
the simple task of asking a monk for a meeting. The way King Pasenadi acts in the Madhyama-āgama account reads more realistic in comparison.

MN II 113  The two versions agree that, on reaching the riverbank, Pasenadi offered his elephant
rug to Ānanda, which the latter declined to use. [318] According to the Madhyama-āgama
version, Pasenadi repeated this offer three times, so that Ānanda consequently refused
three times. While in the Majjhima-nikāya version King Pasenadi simply put his ques

317 A relief on a pillar of the Bhārhut Stūpa, reproduced in Cunningham 1879 plate 13 (described on p. 91),
shows Pasenadi in a chariot attended by three servants, one of which holds an umbrella over the king
while the other holds a chauri (fly whisk). The chariot is preceded by footmen and a horseman, and followed by other men and elephants. Although in this instance Pasenadi rides a chariot and not an elephant,
this representation gives some idea of the pomp with which an ancient Indian king like Pasenadi would
set out (Barua 1934a: 46 suggests that this relief portrays Pasenadi’s visit to the Buddha described in
[[MN89]]). This makes it improbable that someone who met him on the roads of the city could have been
in doubts whether the person he saw was the king of the country. In fact, according to information provided by Megasthenes, in ancient India “a private person is not allowed to keep ... an elephant. These
animals are held to be the special property of the king”, cf. McCrindle 1877: 90. Independent of the accuracy of this description, the fact that according to both versions Pasenadi was riding an elephant and
was in the company of a minister should have been sufficiently clear indications regarding the identity
of the elephant’s rider.

tion, according to the Madhyama-āgama account he at first asked permission to pose a
question, which Ānanda readily granted. [319]
The tendency to enhance the respectful behaviour shown by King Pasenadi towards
Ānanda, found in both versions, could be due to what according to tradition forms the
background to the question King Pasenadi is about to ask. The Pāli commentary explains that King Pasenadi’s inquiry was related to the murder of the female wanderer
Sundarī. [320]
A discourse in the Udāna reports this incident in detail, relating that other wanderers
had wanted to discredit the Buddha. For this purpose, they asked the female wanderer
Sundarī to visit Jeta’s Grove on frequent occasions. When they knew that her visits had
become public knowledge, they killed Sundarī and buried her in Jeta’s Grove. Once
her body had been discovered in Jeta’s Grove, the other wanderers went around town,
announcing this discovery and accusing the Buddhist monks of having taken their
pleasure with Sundarī and then killed her. [321] People believed this defamation and started
to revile the monks.
The Buddha thereon instructed the monks that they should react to such abuse by pronouncing a stanza on the evil destiny of those who makes false allegations and of those


319 [[MA214]] at T I 798a9: “I would like to ask a question, will you allow me to ask it”,
? Such a formal request for permission to ask a question is a recurrent feature of Madhyama-āgama
discourses, whereas it is not found in the corresponding Majjhima-nikāya parallels, cf., e.g., [[MA34]] at
T I 475a17 and [[MN124]] at MN III 125,5, [[MA79]] at T I 549c26 and [[MN127]] at MN III 145,28, [[MA144]]

Hence the occurrence of this formulaic request in [[MA214]] may just be an instance of a pericope used by the 欲有所問, 聽我問 Madh耶 yama-āgama reciters, without necessarily being related to the particular event recorded in [[MA214]]
320 Ps III 346,16: sundarivatthusmi� uppannam ida� sutta�.
321 [[UD4.8]] at [[UD43-45]] An account of the same incident in Dhp-a III 474,3 differs in so far as it presents
the attempt at defamation as being more directly aimed at the Buddha. According to its presentation, on
coming from Jeta’s Grove Sundarī had told people that she had spent the night with the Buddha. Thus,
the rumour spread by the wanderers was that the Buddha’s disciples murdered her in order to cover up
the Buddha’s misconduct (cf. also Jā II 416,5). A version of this incident in the Chinese counterpart to
the A��haka-vagga (the Pāli version is only found in the commentary, cf. Pj II 518-519) agrees with Dhpa that the purpose of the plot was to bring the Buddha into disrepute, cf. T 198 at T IV 176c3, translated
in Bapat 1945: 156-158; for a parallel in the Udānāla�kāra, preserved in Tocharian, cf. fragment 16b46 in Sieg 1949: 29. For the plot to be aimed specifically at the Buddha would in fact fit the Bāhitikasutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel better, as in both versions King Pasenadi inquired about the
moral integrity of the Buddha himself, not about the morality of the monks in general. Făxiăn ( )
and Xuánzàng ( ) refer to the place where Sundarī had been buried, cf. T 2085 at T LI 860c17 and
T 2087 at T LI 899c20, translated in Legge 1886/1998: 59 and Beal 1884/2001b: 7, for further references cf. Deeg 2005: 307-308 and Lamotte 1944/1981: 507 note 1. Feer 1897: 316 suggests that this
tale and the story of Ciñcamā�avikā may be derivatives of a single event.

who deny a misdeed they have done. [322] This served its purpose and convinced people
of the innocence of the Buddhist monks.
Against this background, it becomes understandable why the Bāhitika-sutta and its
Madhyama-āgama parallel are at pains to show that King Pasenadi did not exhibit any
disrespect to Ānanda, even though his mission was to inquire into the moral integrity
of Ānanda’s teacher, the Buddha.
According to both versions, King Pasenadi went about this inquiry by asking Ānanda if the Buddha would undertake a bodily deed censured by other Brahmins and recluses. Ānanda denied this, making a point of qualifying in his answer that the Buddha
would not undertake a bodily deed censured by “wise” Brahmins and recluses. [323]
The point of this additional qualification appears to be that Ānanda wanted to distinguish between righteous censure by “wise” recluses and Brahmins and unjustified criticism that presumably sometimes had been raised by contemporary recluses and Brahmins against the Buddha.
MN II 114  The two versions record that King Pasenadi expressed his appreciation for the finer
distinction introduced by Ānanda in this way. The Majjhima-nikāya version reports
that the king did this by proclaiming that, what he had not been able to accomplish with
his question, Ānanda had accomplished with his reply. [324] According to the Madhyama

322 [[DHP|DHP306]] “he who speaks falsehood and who disclaims what he has done goes to hell”, abhūtavādī
niraya� upeti, yo vā pi katvā na karomi c’ āha (C [e] -[[DHP|DHP100.14]] and S [e] -[[DHP|DHP55.14]] karomī ti), a stanza
also found in [[SNP3.10]] at [[SNP661]] (in relation to the monk Kokālika), in [[UD4.8]] at [[UD45.10]] and in It 2:11
at It 42,18. Parallels to this stanza can be found in stanza 269 of the Gāndhārī Dharmapada in Brough
1962/2001: 161, stanza 114 of the Patna Dharmapada in Cone 1989: 132 or Roth 1980b: 107, T 210 at
T IV 570a7, T 212 at T IV 663c29, T 213 at T IV 781b3, and stanza 8:1 of the Sanskrit and Tibetan
Udāna-(varga) in Bernhard 1965: 161 (cf. also stanza 83 in Nakatani 1987: 28 and the study of 8:1c in
Schmithausen 1970: 83) and in Beckh 1911: 29 or in Zongtse 1990: 98. Rau 1959: 173 notes that a
similar stanza occurs in the Mahābhārata (Mbh 12.197.3). According to the background narration in T
212 at T IV 663c18, the Buddha spoke this stanza in reply to a woman who feigned to be pregnant by
tying a piece of wood in front of her belly and then publicly accused him of being responsible for her
pregnancy. This account reminds of the story of Ciñcamā�avikā described at Dhp-a III 178,4 and in Jā
472 at Jā IV 187,3, cf. also the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya version of this tale in Dutt 1984a: 161. For
a more detailed examination of this stanza cf. also Palihawadana 2009 and Silk 2009.
323 Following Be-MN II 316,6 and Ce-MN II 542,10, where the king spoke only of censure by recluses and
Brahmins, sama�ehi brāhmanehi, while Ānanda in his reply spoke of “wise recluses and Brahmins”,
sama�ehi brāhmanehi viññūhi. This subtle difference is lost in E [e] -MN II 113,33 and in S [e] -MN II 500,8,
as in these editions the king uses the qualification “wise” already in his question, so that the reply he
receives corresponds to his question. On this reading, Ānanda’s answer would be formulated exactly as
the king’s question, in which case there would be no reason for the king to express his appreciation of
Ānanda’s ability to accomplish something with his answer that had not been accomplished in the question, as reported in all editions of [[MN88]] (cf. quote in note 324 below). [[MA214]] at T I 798a12 agrees
with the Burmese and Ceylonese editions, as it reports that the king formulated his question by referring only to Brahmins and recluses, whereas Ānanda in his reply additionally brought in the qualification “intelligent and wise”, .
324 [[MN88]] at MN II 114,7: “what we have not been able to accomplish by [our] question, that the venerable Ānanda has accomplished by answering the question”, ya� hi maya� ... nāsakkhimha pañhena

āgama version, the king went so far as to repeat his first question, this time with the
qualification “wise”, thereby acknowledging that his question should from the outset
have been phrased in the way Ānanda had formulated his reply. [325]
In both versions, King Pasenadi next inquired about the nature of a censurable deed.
This inquiry proceeds, via a series of alternative terms, to the definition of a censurable
deed to be a deed that leads to one’s own affliction and to the affliction of others, being
a deed that causes an increase of unwholesomeness.
While the Madhyama-āgama version examines only bodily conduct in this way, the
Majjhima-nikāya version applies a similar examination also to verbal and mental conduct. [326]
The Madhyama-āgama version continues to explore the nature of a censurable deed
in additional detail, indicating that such a censurable deed obstructs the attainment of
Nirvā�a and prevents one from knowing in accordance with reality what should be
done and what should not be done. [327]
According to the Majjhima-nikāya account, King Pasenadi concluded his examination of the nature of unwholesome deeds by inquiring from Ānanda if the Buddha recommended the abandoning of all unwholesome states. His question in the Madhyamaāgama version was instead why the Buddha would not undertake unwholesome conduct. [328] Both versions report Ānanda replying that the Buddha had eradicated all unwholesomeness and was endowed with wholesome qualities. The Bāhitika-sutta and its
parallel continue by applying their respective treatments to the complementary case of
wholesome deeds.
According to both versions, King Pasenadi was so delighted by Ānanda’s exposition
that he would have given him even an elephant, a horse, or a village, if such gifts had
been allowable to a monk. [329] The two versions agree that Pasenadi offered Ānanda a


paripūretu�, ta� ... āyasmatā ānandena pañhassa veyyākara�ena paripūrita� (B [e] -MN II 316,14 and
S [e] -MN II 500,16: yañ hi).
325 [[MA214]] at T I 798a21.
326 [[MN88]] at MN II 114,30. When evaluating this difference, the treatment in [[MA214]] would seem sufficient in the present context. The background to the king’s inquiry is an allegation of murder, so that it
would be natural for the king to inquire about bodily conduct. A case could still be made for verbal conduct, since the speaking of falsehood in the sense of a denial to have anything to do with the murder
could also be pertinent. Once this much has been ascertained, however, to continue examining mental
conduct would not add further proof to the king’s inquiry. In the discourses, it is a standard procedure
to present conduct from the perspective of its bodily, verbal, and mental aspects, so that it could easily
have happened during the process of transmission that an occurrence of bodily conduct on its own, or
perhaps of bodily and verbal conduct, was ‘completed’ so as to cover mental conduct as well.
327 This exposition in [[MA214]] at T I 798b4 brings to mind the four ways of undertaking things, examined
in [[MN46]] at MN I 310,10.
328 [[MA214]] at T I 798b21: “what is the reason why the Tathāgata does not undertake such things at all”,
?
329 While according to [[MA214]] at T I 799a14 the king mentioned an ordinary elephant or horse (and additionally also cattle and sheep, women and gold), [[MN88]] at MN II 116,22 speaks of the hatthiratana and
the assaratana, two properties of a wheel-turning king. Since Pasenadi was not a wheel-turning king,

precious cloth. After initial hesitation Ānanda accepted, convinced by Pasenadi’s dexterous comparison of the nearby river that overflows after a heavy rain to the overflowing of merit that would accrue if Ānanda were to accept the cloth and share his old
robes with other monks.

MN II 117  According to both versions, Ānanda reported the conversation he had with the king
to the Buddha. The Majjhima-nikāya version concludes with a proclamation made by
the Buddha to the monks, indicating that it was a great gain for King Pasenadi to have
met and worshiped Ānanda. The Madhyama-āgama version does not report such a statement. According to its account, after hearing the conversation that had taken place, the
Buddha simply concluded that Ānanda had replied in the proper way.


[[MN89]] Dhammacetiya-sutta

The Dhammacetiya-sutta, the “discourse on Dharma monuments”, describes the reasons for King Pasenadi’s faith in the Buddha. This discourse has two Chinese parallels,
found in the Madhyama-āgama and in the Ekottarika-āgama. [330] An account of the
events reported in the present discourse can also be found in the K�udrakavastu of the
(Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, preserved in Chinese and in Tibetan. [331] Besdies, a few
sections of a version of this discourse have been preserved in Gāndhārī fragments. [332] In
addition to these parallel versions, a Pāli discourse similar in several respects to the
Dhammacetiya-sutta can be found among the tens of the A�guttara-nikāya. [333]


for him to proclaim his willingness to make a gift quite evidently beyond his abilities would have to
have a symbolic sense. In fact, in [[SN22.17]] at SN I 97,6 and its parallel [[SA1227]] at T II 335b18 he similarly indicates that he would be willing to give away these two treasures if by doing so he could have
prevented the passing away of his grandmother. However, in other parallels to [[SN22.17]] SĀ [2] 54 at T II
392b6, [[EA26.7]] at T II 638b24, and T 122 at T II 545b4, what he would be willing to give away seem to
be just a normal elephant or horse. Another difference is that in these versions it is the death of his
mother that Pasenadi would rather have prevented; cf. also SHT VI 1586 (p. 202).
330 The parallels are [[MA213]] at T I 795b-797c and [[EA38.10]] at T II 724b-725b. [[MA213]] agrees with [[MN89]] on locating the discourse in the Sakyan country and has the title “discourse on Dharma ornaments”,
, similar to the title of [[MN89]] (Hirakawa 1997: 1015 and Soothill 1937/2000: 363 indicate
to correspond to ala�kāra). According to [[EA38.10]] at T II 724c10, the Buddha was staying in a
village in the Sakyan country,, which stands in direct contrast to the same version’s initial
declaration at T II 724b28 that the Buddha was staying in Jeta’s Grove, .
This internal inconsistency shows how at times locations like Jeta’s Grove are automatically applied to
a discourse without taking into account if this location fits the particular event depicted in the discourse
(cf. also below p. 887 note 138). According to Barua 1934a: 46, a relief on the Bhārhut Stūpa, cf. Cunningham 1879 plate 13, portrays the visit by Pasenadi to the Buddha that is described in [[MN89]]
331 T 1451 at T XXIV 237a-238b and D (6) ’dul ba, tha 82a-86a or Q (1035) de 79a-83a, parts of which

The Dhammacetiya-sutta, its two Chinese discourse parallels, and the K�udrakavastu
report that during a pleasure outing King Pasenadi felt inspired to pay a visit to the Buddha. According to the introductory account in the A�guttara-nikāya discourse, however,
King Pasenadi approached the Buddha after having won a battle. [334]
The Dhammacetiya-sutta and its parallels describe in similar ways how monks engaged in walking meditation directed King Pasenadi to the dwelling where the Buddha
was staying. According to the Dhammacetiya-sutta and the A�guttara-nikāya discourse,
on coming to the presence of the Buddha, King Pasenadi went so far as to caress and
kiss the Buddha’s feet. [335] The Madhyama-āgama discourse, the Ekottarika-āgama discourse, and the K�udrakavastu version do not record that King Pasenadi kissed or caressed the Buddha’s feet. [336]
Several Pāli discourses portray other visitors displaying similar behaviour towards
the Buddha. Except for one parallel in an individual translation, none of the Chinese
Āgama parallels to these instances depict the visitors performing any kissing or caressing of the Buddha’s feet. [337]

334 [[AN10.30]] at AN V 65,7 specifies that this was a “sham fight”, uyyodhika, whereas according to the
commentary Mp V 27,26 it was a real fight.
335 [[MN89]] at MN II 120,3 and [[AN10.30]] at AN V 65,25; cf. also Horner 1957/1970: xxv. [[MN89]] and [[AN10.30]] agree that King Pasenadi at the same time also pronounced his name and rank twice. For King
Pasenadi to go so far as to kiss the Buddha’s feet and caress them comes somewhat unexpected at this
point of events. All that has happened so far, according to [[MN89]] is that during a pleasure outing Pasenadi saw roots of trees, suitable for secluded dwelling, which reminded him of the Buddha. Although
the inspiration derived from seeing these tree roots may well have motivated him to travel a reasonable
distance in order to visit the Buddha, it would be considerably more difficult to envisage such inspiration to be sufficient grounds for the king of the country to show such an extreme way of expressing his
humility and worship. The same hold true all the more if the meeting with the Buddha took place after
Pasenadi had won a battle, as is the case in [[AN10.30]]
336 [[MA213]] at T I 795c18 and [[EA38.10]] at T II 724c26 only report that King Pasenadi expressed his respect by bowing at the Buddha’s feet and pronouncing his name and rank three times. Although [[MA213]] introduces Pasenadi’s words by indicating that he proclaimed his name and rank three times,,
the actual quote of his words runs only into two proclamations, similar to [[MN89]] at MN II 120,3. The
Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1977: 154,14 reports that on another occasion King Bimbisāra also approached the Buddha, after putting aside his royal insignia, and expressed his respect by proclaiming
his name and rank for three times, trir ātmano nāmadheyam anuśrāvayati, a case where, as in [[MA213]]
the actual quote of his words only has two proclamations. T 1451 at T XXIV 237b4 does not even record that King Pasenadi pronounced his name, but only describes that he bowed down and expressed
his joy at personally beholding the Buddha after a long time. Its Tibetan counterpart in D (6) ’dul ba,
tha 83a3 or Q (1035) de 79b8 notes that, after bowing down at the Buddha’s feet, King Pasenadi “wiped
his face and mouth” (wiping of perspiration?) before addressing the Buddha, gdong dang kha phyis nas.
Could this be a misunderstanding of an expression similar to the Pāli version’s pādāni mukhena ca pa 再三  ricumbati in [[MN89]] at MN II 120,2? Senior fragments 1+3 [[AN1.1]] have preserved what appears to be a
description of the king’s prostration at the Buddha’s feet.
337 In [[MN91]] at MN II 144,26 an old Brahmin of high social standing kisses and caresses the Buddha’s feet;
in [[SN7.15]] at SN I 178,7 (or SN [2] 201 at SN [2] I 383,3) the same is undertaken by a Brahmin known for
his unwillingness to pay homage to anyone, even his parents; and in [[SN8.9]] at SN I 193,32 (or SN [2] 217

512   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


MN II 120  The Dhammacetiya-sutta and the A�guttara-nikāya discourse report that the Buddha
asked King Pasenadi why he gave such supreme honour to the Buddha’s body. [338] According to the Chinese and Tibetan versions, however, the Buddha simply asked King
Pasenadi what motivated his respect for the Buddha, a way of presenting the Buddha’s
inquiry in keeping with Pasenadi’s less exceptional way of worshipping the Buddha in
these accounts. [339]
The Dhammacetiya-sutta and its parallels differ on the reasons given by King Pasenadi in reply. While the Majjhima-nikāya, the Madhyama-āgama, and the K�udrakavastu versions describe similar reasons, only one of these reasons recurs in the Ekottarika-āgama list. [340] The A�guttara-nikāya discourse does not have any of the reasons
mentioned in the Dhammacetiya-sutta (see table 9.6). [341]


689a13 (parallel to [[MN91]]), [[SA92]] at T II 24a10 and SĀ [2] 258 at T II 464a18 (parallels to [[SN7.15]]), as
well as [[SA1209]] at T II 329b10 and SĀ [2] 225 at T II 456c12 (parallels to [[SN8.9]]) do not mention any
kissing or caressing of the Buddha’s feet. The only exception to this is the individual translation T 76 at
T I 885c10 (parallel to [[MN91]] cf. below p. 544 note 78), which agrees with the Pāli version’s description of the Brahmin’s behaviour. Regarding this particular instance in [[MN91]] Wagle 1967: 282 comments that “such behaviour by a brāhma�a is extremely rare and one suspects the missionary bias of the
Buddhist writers in describing this scene”.
338 According to [[MN89]] at MN II 120,5 (cf. also [[AN10.30]] at AN V 66,1), the Buddha asked King Pasenadi “what reason, great king, do you see for doing such supreme honour to this body”, ki� pana tva�,
mahārāja, atthavasa� sampassamāno imasmi� sarīre evarūpa� paramanipaccākāra� karosi (B [e] -MN
II 322,16 and S [e] -MN II 509,2: paramanipaccakāra�)? The Senior fragments 1+3 Aa+[[DN2]] recto and 1.2
verso have preserved parts of this question, which appears to be similar to [[MN89]]
339 According to [[MA213]] at T I 795c23, the Buddha asked: “what reasons do you see in me [that you] lower
yourself with the intention to pay respect at [my] feet and perform an act of worship”,
? [[EA38.10]] at T II 725a10 records the Buddha’s question in this manner: “now, what do you say [why] the Tathāgata should receive people’s worship”,
? According to T 1451 at T XXIV 237b6, the Buddha asked the king: “for what reason do
you prostrate to me, being able to lower yourself and be [so] solicitous”,
?, while in its Tibetan counterpart at D (6) ’dul ba, tha 83a4 or Q (1035) de 80a1, the Buddha
asked: “great king, why do you humble yourself towards the Tathāgata so much more than even the
lowliest”, rgyal po chen po khyod ci’i phyir de bzhin gshegs pa la shin tu dman pa bas kyang ches
dman pa byed? [[EA38.10]] at T II 724c28 provides additional background to its version of the Buddha’s
question, as it reports that Pasenadi had also expressed the wish that the Buddha may live long for the
benefit of gods and men. The Buddha replied by also wishing Pasenadi long life, so that he may govern 見我有何等義,
而自下意稽首禮足, rightly and receive the fruits of his good conduct on being reborn in heaven. Pasenadi 供養承事耶 then proclaimed
that people pay homage to the Tathāgata because of his virtues, which caused the Buddha to inquire 汝今云何言如來
what Pasenadi thought to be the reason why people pay homage to the Tathāgata. 應受人禮拜
340 [[EA38.10]] at T II 725a11 lists six reasons for Pasenadi’s regard for the Buddha, out of which five are not 何故於我頓能降伏屈己
慇懃 found in the other versions. These five (cf. also table 9.6) are that the teaching of the Buddha is practised
by the wise; that his noble disciples are accomplished in morality, wisdom, liberation, and knowledgeand-vision-of-liberation ( and variant readings include also their accomplishment in concentration); that he has four assemblies of practising disciples (i.e. male and female, monastics and laity);
that he has overcome the sixty-two views (a reference to the sixty-two grounds for views described in
[[DN1]] at DN I 12-43 and its parallels); and the potential of recalling the virtues of the Buddha at the
time of passing away, by dint of which even someone of evil bodily, verbal, or mental conduct will be

The Majjhima-nikāya and Madhyama-āgama discourses and the K�udrakavastu agree
that Pasenadi contrasted other recluses, who after some time disrobe and enjoy sensual
pleasures, with the case of the Buddhist monks, who instead keep living the holy life
until they pass away. [342]

reborn in a heavenly realm, [[EA38.10]] at T II 725a29: .
Harrison 1978a: 36 draws attention to other passages in the Ekottarika-āgama that similarly emphasize
the potential of recollecting the Buddha, such as [[EA41.5]] at T II 740a1, where a householder destined
to be reborn in hell goes forth and practises the ten recollections for a single day, with the result that he
is reborn in heaven, or [[EA3.1]] at T II 554a12, which gives quite detailed instructions for undertaking
recollection of the Buddha; cf. also below p. 822 note 9. [[AN1.98]] at AN I 30,6 reckons recollecting the
Buddha a practice that is entirely conducive to realization (sambodha) and [the attainment of] Nirvā�a,
thereby also highlighting its potential, although in less exuberant terms than the Ekottarika-āgama; cf.
also Demiéville 1924: 232 note 6. In fact, even what appears to be an incipient stage of a more visual
mode of undertaking recollection of the Buddha can be found already among the early discourses, highlighted by Schmithausen 2000b: 10, cf. also Odani 2007: 441. The passage in question occurs in a stan- 身口意行惡, 彼若命終, 憶如來功德 ... 得生天上
za in the Sutta-nipāta, where the Brahmin Pi�giya explains that he has no need to be in the presence of
the Buddha, since he is able to see the Buddha with his mind as if with the eyes, [[SN45.21]] at [[SNP1142]]

The Majjhima-nikāya version continues by contrasting the quarrels that arise even
between close family members with the absence of quarrels among the Buddhist monks,
who live together harmoniously. [343]
The Madhyama-āgama discourse and the K�udrakavastu present the same topic in
different terms, as they contrast family quarrels with monks who, even though they disrobe and return to the lay life, nevertheless do not lose their respect for the Buddha and
blame themselves for not having been able to continue to stay in robes. [344] This description does not fit too well with the other reason for Pasenadi’s faith, which was that the
Buddhist monks do not disrobe. [345]

MN II 121  According to the Dhammacetiya-sutta, its Madhyama-āgama parallel, and the K�udrakavastu account, King Pasenadi was also inspired by the happy demeanour of the
Buddhist monks, [346] as well as by their silent attention when the Buddha was delivering

343 [[MN89]] at MN II 120,22.
344 [[MA213]] at T I 796a3, T 1451 at T XXIV 238a8, and D (6) ’dul ba, tha 85a1 or Q (1035) de 81b5. The
respectful attitude of monks who have disrobed is also described in [[MN77]] at MN II 5,14.
345 That monks did disrobe is also recorded in other Pāli discourses, cf., e.g., [[MN12]] at MN I 68,8 and [[AN3.64]] at AN I 185,8, according to which Sunakkhatta and Sarabha even spoke disparagingly about the
Buddha’s teaching after they had left the order. The monk community also does not always seem to
have lived in harmony and concord, as according to [[MN128]] at MN III 153,3 and its parallels (cf. below p. 732), among the monks of Kosambī such a quarrel arose that they were unwilling to allow even
the Buddha to intervene and settle it. To this one could add Devadatta’s schism, an event that would be
another instance when the Buddhist monks’ community did not live in harmony and concord, cf. Vin
III 171,3; for a comparative study of this event cf. Bareau 1991 and Mukherjee 1966: 74-94.
346 [[MN89]] at MN II 121,21 describes that the monks were “dependent on others, dwelling with a mind like
deer”, paradavutte migabhūtena cetasā viharante (B [e] -MN II 323,21: paradattavutte, C [e] -MN II 554,20:
paradavuttā and viharanti). The corresponding passage in [[MA213]] at T I 796a29 reads .
The reference to may be due to a mistaking of parada for paradāra, “the wife of another”, while
the idea of “protection”,, could be due to mistaking vutta for v�ta, “stopped”, “checked”, “held back”,
or else could be a scribe’s error for, “to get”. Even though the translator(s) appear to have misunderstood an expression like paradavutta (an expression which does indeed have its difficulties, cf.
Horner 1952/1975: 259 note 2), perhaps, through knowledge of some commentarial explanation similar
to Ps III 167,3: paradavuttā ti parehi dinnavuttino, they might have known that the idea of “depending
on others” was involved, an idea they perhaps then attempted to bring out with the image of
“[taking] food from the wives of others”. While T 1451 at T XXIV 237c29 describes that the monks
“always feel fear, like deer in the forest”,, the passage in D (6) ’dul ba, tha 84b4 or
Q (1035) de 81b1 could also be based on an equivalent to paradavutta, as it reads “not depending on 護他妻食如鹿
他妻
護
護 獲
他妻食,
常懷兢懼如鹿依林


Chapter 9 Rāja-vagga                                        -  515


teachings. [347] As was already the case in the Mahāsakuludāyi-sutta, here too the Majjhima-nikāya version illustrates the silent attention that prevails during a talk given by
the Buddha by narrating how on one occasion a disciple was admonished for clearing
his throat, while the Madhyama-āgama version instead reports that this disciple was
snoring. [348] In agreement with the Majjhima-nikāya account, the K�udrakavastu also
records that the disciple merely coughed, not envisaging the possibility that he may
have fallen asleep while the Buddha was giving a talk. [349]
The Dhammacetiya-sutta next describes how warriors, Brahmins, householders, and
recluses would approach the Buddha with the intention of challenging and vanquishing
him in debate. Instead of defeating the Buddha, the Dhammacetiya-sutta reports, they
are much rather converted, in fact the recluses even go forth under the Buddha and become arahants. This quality is also included in the Ekottarika-āgama account, which
similar to the Dhammacetiya-sutta speaks of warriors, Brahmins, householders, and
recluses that are unable to defeat the Buddha in debate, without, however, mentioning
that they would become his disciples or even go forth under him and become arahants. [350]
The Madhyama-āgama discourse and the Chinese K�udrakavastu account differ from
the Dhammacetiya-sutta in as much as they speak only of recluses and Brahmins who
approach the Buddha for debate, thereby not mentioning warriors or householders. [351] In
regard to these wise recluses and Brahmins, they envisage four possible outcomes:


other sustenance”, ’tsho ba gzhan la rag ma lus pa. A contrast between the happy demeanour of the
Buddhist monks and other ascetics can also be found in SHT III 806 R2-5 (p. 13), attributed in this
fragment to the Brahmin Lokecca (a fragment which does not seem to correspond to any of the two occurrences of the Brahmin Lohicca in the Pāli discourses, [[DN12]] at DN I 224-234 or [[SN35.132]] at SN
IV 116-121).
347 While according to [[MN89]] at MN II 122,10, on this occasion the Buddha was teaching an audience of
“several hundreds”, anekasatāya parisāya, and according to [[MA213]] at T I 797a17 a “great assembly”,
, according to T 1451 at T XXIV 238a22 he was teaching “a great company of uncountable hundred-thousands”, . The Tibetan K�udrakavastu at D (6) ’dul ba, tha 85a5 or Q (1035) de
82a2, however, agrees with [[MN89]] that the Buddha was teaching ‘only’ an audience of many hundreds,
’khor brgya phrag du ma’i gung la.
348 [[MN89]] at MN II 122,12: ukkāsi, whereas according to [[MA213]] at T I 797a18 he “made noise [by] snoring [while] sleeping”,, with a variant reading according to which the monk “made noise

[by] drooling [while] sleeping”, . Cf. also above p. 421 note 152.
349 T 1451 at T XXIV 238a26:, to which D (6) ’dul ba, tha 85a5 or Q (1035) de 82a2 adds that
he also made the sound of sneezing, lud pa’i sgra and sbrid pa’i sgra.
350 [[EA38.10]] at T II 725a25. The same difference recurs between [[MN27]] at MN I 177,13 and its parallel
大眾 [[MA146]] at T I 656b23, where [[MN27]] also stands alone in reporting that those who challenge the Buddha become his disciples and some even go forth and become arahants. A contrast to the descriptions 無量百千大眾
given in [[MN27]] and [[MN89]] can be found in [[DN25]] at DN III 57,12 and its parallel [[MA104]] at T I 595b29,
according to which on one occasion a whole group of recluses were unwilling to go forth under the
Buddha even though he had openly invited them.
351 [[MA213]] at T I 796b15 and T 1451 at T XXIV 237b 鼾眠作聲 聖 11. This is not entirely the case for the Tibetan K�udrakavastu version, which in its examination of the fourth group of debaters at D (6) 口汙眠作聲 ’dul ba, tha 84a1
or Q (1035) de 80b6, switches 謦欬發聲 from the earlier used dge sbyong dang bram ze, “recluses and Brahmins”,
to bram ze dang khyim bdag, “Brahmins and householders”.



MN II 122


516   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


       - the recluses and Brahmins do not even dare to put their question,

       - they are delighted with what the Buddha teaches them,

       - they take refuge,

       - they go forth under the Buddha and by dint of earnest practice in seclusion become arahants.

MN II 123 Another reason for King Pasenadi’s faith, listed in the Dhammacetiya-sutta, the Madhyama-āgama discourse, and the K�udrakavastu version, [352] is that his two courtiers
showed more respect to the Buddha than they would show to him, even though they
depended on the king for their livelihood.
To illustrate this, Pasenadi related an occasion when he had to put up in the same
room with his two courtiers. The two courtiers lay down in such a way that their head
was pointing towards the direction were the Buddha was dwelling, even though this
caused them to point their feet towards the king, a disrespectful way of behaviour according to Indian custom. [353]
According to the Majjhima-nikāya version, the two courtiers spent much of the night
in a discussion on the Dharma. The Madhyama-āgama account, however, instead reports that they spent the first part of the night silently sitting in meditation. [354] The K�udrakavastu agrees in this respect with the Majjhima-nikāya presentation, as it reports
that the two courtiers were engaged in praising the virtues of the Buddha and speaking
about the Dharma and the Sa�gha. [355]
Another minor but noteworthy difference is that, according to the Majjhima-nikāya
account, the king referred to his two courtiers as “those venerable ones”, using the word
āyasmant, [356] while the Madhyama-āgama discourse does not record that the king used
this epithet. [357]


352 [[MA213]] at T I 797a25 and T I 797b2 presents this issue as two qualities, first taking up the higher respect they had for the Buddha as a reason for Pasenadi’s faith, and then relating how they once spent
the night in the same room together with King Pasenadi, which [[MA213]] presents as yet another reason
for Pasenadi’s faith in the Buddha. T 1451 at T XXIV 238b4 and its Tibetan counterpart at D (6) ’dul
ba, tha 85b4 or Q (1035) de 82a8, however, agree with [[MN89]] on presenting this as only one quality. In
fact, the story of their behaviour at night is but an illustration of their respect for the Buddha and thus
does not amount to a separate quality.
353 [[SN55.6]] at SN V 352,3 indicates that Isidatta and Purā�a had reached stream-entry (cf. also [[AN6.120]]
at AN III 451,12) and according to [[AN6.44]] at AN III 348,1 (= [[AN10.75]] at AN V 139,3) they passed
away as once-returners. This would explain why they had such high regard for the Buddha.
354 [[MN89]] at MN II 124,5: bahudeva ratti� dhammiyā kathāya vītināmetvā and [[MA213]] at T I 797b4:

355 T 1451 at T XXIV 238b10 records that the two “praised the excellent qualities of the Buddha and discussed the right Dharma and the jewel of the order as a field of merit”,
. D (6) ’dul ba, tha 85b6 or Q (1035) de 82b2 similarly reports that they praised the Buddha, his
teaching and the community, sangs rgyas kyi bsngags pa brjod, chos dang dge ’dun gyi bsngags pa
brjod nas.
356 [[MN89]] at MN II 124,11: ime āyasmanto.
357 According to [[MA213]] at T I 797b7, Pasenadi referred to his employees as “these two courtiers Isidatta
and Purā�a”, (the Chinese and Tibetan K�udrakavastu do not have such a reference).

At first sight, the use of āyasmant is unexpected, since this term is usually employed
in the discourses to refer to monks. [358] The use of āyasmant to address laity recurs in several Pāli discourses, where again the Chinese versions differ by not recording this form of
address. [359] Instances of the use of the address āyasmant for laity can also be found in
the case of several pātimokkha rules, which depict even a monk addressing laity with
āyasmant. [360] In this case, too, the Chinese Vinayas do not employ this form of address. [361]
The Sanskrit versions of the Mahāsā�ghika, (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda, and Sarvāstivāda
prātimok�a rules, however, do employ the corresponding address āyu�mant, [362] just as
the Tibetan version of the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda prātimok�a uses the corresponding form
tshe dang ldan pa. [363]
In fact, the use of āyasmant in its counterparts in these different passages does not
necessarily convey nuances of venerability, [364] as the address “friend”, āvuso, is merely
a vocative form of the same word. [365] Hence, the use of āyasmant would be an appropriate way for a king to refer to his employees, or for a monk to refer to laity.

358 DP I: 321 s.v. āyasma(t) explains that this term is a “honorific and respectful title of a bhikkhu”. Childers 1875/1993: 75 s.v. āyasmā and PED: 105 s.v. āyasmant similarly speak of a “respectful appelation” for a bhikkhu “of some standing”.
359 [[MN68]] at MN I 467,10 describes how a lay follower recollects another lay follower as a “venerable
one”, āyasmā, while in its counterpart in [[MA77]] at T I 546b8 the lay follower recollects the other as a
“lay follower”, . Another instance can be found in [[SN55.54]] at SN V 409,4, which describes a
layman who addresses another layman about to pass away as āyasma, while in its Chinese counterpart
in [[SA1122]] at T II 298a18 the layman simply addresses the other layman with “you” (respectful form),
, and “you”, . An instance without a Chinese counterpart can be found in [[AN4.242]] at AN II
241,26+28, which depicts how a layperson confesses a misdeed to another layperson by using bhante
and āyasmant.

By the time of the Chinese translations, however, the term āyasmant or āyu�mant may
have become an exclusively monastic form of address, so that, when translating the
above surveyed passages, the translators replaced āyasmant (etc.) with other expressions that seemed more appropriate to the context, or simply left the passage without
any form of address. Thus, this rather minor difference in formulation, which appears
to be a persistent trait in Chinese translations, provides a good example for how the
Chinese worldview could influence the way the Indian originals were translated.

MN II 124  Another quality that according to the Dhammacetiya-sutta inspired King Pasenadi’s
respect for the Buddha was that they were both members of the warrior class, they both
came from the Kosala country, and were both of the same age. [366] According to the Madhyama-āgama version and the K�udrakavastu account, King Pasenadi also noted the similarity of his status as the king of the country and the Buddha’s status as the king of the
Dharma. The K�udrakavastu makes it clear that, in this respect, the king felt inferior to
the Buddha. [367]
This helps to clarify what inspired Pasenadi’s respect, since to be of similar origin
and age may inspire feelings of friendship and companionship, but would not be selfevident grounds for worshipping the other. In contrast, for the king of the country to
meet a king of the Dharma would indeed be a good reason to feel respect and have a
desire to worship the latter.
The Dhammacetiya-sutta and its Chinese parallels agree that, once King Pasenadi
had left, the Buddha instructed the monks to memorize this discourse, as to bear it in
mind would be beneficial for their progress. [368] According to the Madhyama-āgama ac

and Pischel 1900/1981: 324; cf. also Horner 1938/1982: xxxviii. In fact, in the description of the actual
events leading up to the rules at Vin III 215,23, Vin III 218,7, Vin III 220,2, and Vin III 259,8, the monk
uses the address āvuso. According to Wijesekera 1993: 36, however, āvuso “probably has its origin in
an older *āyu�a� (the derived adj. from āyus ‘life’) having the sense of ‘O long-lived one!’ and the suggested derivation ... āyu�mant seems to be phonetically less likely”. For a survey of occurrences of āvuso in the Pāli discourses and in the Vinaya cf. Franke 1908: 20-43.
366 Regarding their being of the same age, the Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1977: 46,5 reports that King
Prasenajit and the Buddha were even born on the same day.
367 [[MA213]] at T I 797b12: “I am the king of the country, the Blessed One is the king of the Dharma”,
, and T 1451 at T XXIV 238b18: “I have been crowned as the warrior king, the Blessed One is the unsurpassable Dharma king, my power cannot measure up in any way compared to the
Buddha”, . T 1451 at T XXIV 238b29
sums up the point made with this statement by proclaiming that “the king is no equal to the Buddha”,
. In the Tibetan version at D (6) ’dul ba, tha 86a3 or Q (1035) de 82b7, the king simply points
out that “although I am indeed the head-anointed warrior king, yet the Blessed One is indeed the unsurpassable king of the Dharma”, bdag kyang rgyal po rgyal rigs spyi po nas dbang bskur ba lags, bcom
ldan ’das kyang bla na med pa’i chos kyi rgyal po lags pas. As noted by Brekke 1999a: 858, whereas
“the figure of the king symbolizes external mastery”, the Buddha “symbolizes internal mastery”.
368 T 1451 at T XXIV 238c1 and D (6) ’dul ba, tha 86a7 or Q (1035) de 83a3 continue by narrating that, 我亦
國王, while Pasenadi 世尊亦法王 had this conversation with the Buddha, the general who had accompanied him left and,
taking advantage of having received the royal insignia in custody, helped the prince to usurp the throne.
The ensuing series of events culminate with King Pasenadi passing away while seeking help against 我是灌頂剎帝利王, 世尊亦是無上法王, 我力比佛非喻能測
王不如佛


Chapter 9 Rāja-vagga                                        -  519


count, the Buddha even went so far as to ask Ānanda to summon whatever other monks
were living nearby in order to be able to give them this recommendation. [369]
Looking back on the different versions, it is noteworthy that, while the K�udrakavastu
in several aspects agrees with the Dhammacetiya-sutta against the Madhyama-āgama
version, the A�guttara-nikāya discourse differs considerably from the Dhammacetiyasutta. While as an account of an actual encounter it seems improbable that the Buddha
on more than one occasion got King Pasenadi to explain why he had faith in him, the
differences between the two Pāli versions are substantial enough to make it improbable
that they should be considered records of the same event.


[[MN90]] Ka��akatthala-sutta

The Ka��akatthala-sutta, the “discourse at Ka��akatthala”, reports a conversation
between the Buddha and King Pasenadi on omniscience, class distinctions, and devas.
This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama and a parallel in the Bhai�ajyavastu of the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, preserved in Tibetan. [370]
The Ka��akatthala-sutta and its parallels begin by relating that King Pasenadi had
sent a messenger to announce his impending visit to the Buddha. [371] Judging from other
discourses, to have one’s visit announced in this manner could be a polite way of approaching someone that one meets for the first time. [372]
The impression that the present discourse reports an early or perhaps even the first
meeting between King Pasenadi and the Buddha is reinforced by the circumstance that
in both versions Pasenadi does not know Ānanda, the Buddha’s personal attendant. [373]


this dethronement; cf. also, e.g., Amritananda 1983: 68-69, Feer 1883: 65-67, Panglung 1981: 172-173,
and Rockhill 1883/1907: 114-116. The Pāli commentary, Ps III 354,18, reports a similar series of
events taking place after the delivery of the present discourse; cf. also Jā 465 at Jā IV 152,2, Bareau
1981a: 53, and T 211 at T IV 583a16, translated in Willemen 1999: 56.

[[MA212]] has the title “discourse on omniscience”, .
371 [[MN90]] at MN II 125,11, [[MA212]] at T I 792c17, and D (1) ’dul ba, kha 86a7 or Q (1030) ge 79b8. [[MA212]] at T I 792c25 additionally describes how the Buddha replied to the messenger and then told Ānanda to get a room ready for receiving the king. Although the Bhai�ajyavastu version does not report any
reply given by the Buddha to the messenger, D (1) ’dul ba, kha 86b7 or Q (1030) ge 80a7 agrees with
[[MA212]] that the Buddha told Ānanda to prepare a place to receive the king. [[MA212]] at T I 793a21
stands alone in recording that, on arrival, the king encountered monks engaged in walking meditation,
who told Pasenadi to approach the hut where the Buddha was staying, to clear his throat, and to quietly
knock on the door. This part of [[MA212]] thus has the same introductory narration as found in [[MA213]]
at T I 795c5 and its parallels [[MN89]] at MN II 119,17 and D (6) ’dul ba, tha 82b5 or Q (1035) de 79b3.
372 [[DN21]] at DN II 265,1 and [[MN91]] at MN II 141,22 一切智經 describe how Sakka and the Brahmin Brahmāyu in a
similar way sent a messenger ahead to announce their impending arrival. Both instances are their respective first meetings with the Buddha.
373 [[MN90]] at MN II 131,32, [[MA212]] at T I 795a15, and D (1) ’dul ba, kha 91b1 or Q (1030) ge 84a8 report
in similar ways that King Pasenadi inquired after the name of Ānanda. According to the commentary at



MN II 125


520   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


Moreover, in the concluding part of the discourse King Pasenadi expresses his appreciation of the Buddha’s explanation in a somewhat longwinded manner, listing each
answer he has received and expressing his approval after each answer listed, a way of
expressing appreciation found only rarely in other discourses. [374]
In the Ca�kī-sutta, a visitor who has just discarded his distrust and disrespect towards
the Buddha in what the context suggests to be their first meeting uses the same way of
expressing appreciation. [375] This further supports the impression that King Pasenadi’s
meeting with the Buddha at Ka��akatthala could be recording the first or at least one of
their very first meetings.
This impression is corroborated in the Chinese and Tibetan versions by the circumstance that King Pasenadi addresses the Buddha by his name Gotama, [376] a form of address used in the discourses only by those who do not consider themselves disciples of
the Buddha. In the Majjhima-nikāya version, however, King Pasenadi addresses the
Buddha as “venerable sir” and “Blessed One”, [377] a form of address implying that he
considers himself to be in a close relationship with the Buddha.
In the Pāli Nikāyas, an instance where King Pasenadi addresses the Buddha by his
name Gotama can be found in the Dahara-sutta of the Sa�yutta-nikāya, which according to the commentarial explanation was the first meeting of the two. [378] At the end of
the Dahara-sutta, Pasenadi takes refuge and declares himself a lay disciple of the Buddha. [379]

Ps III 361,3, however, King Pasenadi knew Ānanda and only asked this question in order to be able to
praise him. Yet, the formulation of Pasenadi’s question in [[MN90]] [[MA212]] and the Tibetan Bhai�ajyavastu version is such as to suggest that he had not met Ānanda before. The present case can be compared
with [[MN88]] at MN II 112,18, which together with its parallel [[MA214]] at T I 797c19 describes another
occasion when Pasenadi saw Ānanda from afar but was apparently not sure if he had properly recognized him (cf. also above p. 505). [[MN88]] at MN II 112,18 reports that Pasenadi asked a member of his
entourage to confirm that the monk they saw was indeed Ānanda, “isn’t this the venerable Ānanda”,
āyasmā no eso ... ānando ti (C [e] -MN II 540,7: nu kho instead of no)? The question he asked according
to [[MN90]] at MN II 131,32, however, is different, as he inquired: “what is the name of this monk”, ko
nāmo aya� ... bhikkhū ti (S [e] -MN II 525,20: nāmāya�)? Whereas the instance reported in [[MN88]] seems
to reflect some faint acquaintance, in the present case it seems as if the king inquires about the identity
of a monk he has not met before. Thus, the formulation of the question in [[MN90]] does not fit too well
with the commentarial explanation.
374 [[MN90]] at MN II 132,22+25+27+30+33 reports that for each reply he expressed his approval, stating: “that
is liked and accepted by us, thereby we are pleased”, tañ ca pan’ amhāka� ruccati c’ eva khamati ca,
tena c’ amhā attamanā. [[MA212]] at T I 795b5 and D (1) ’dul ba, kha 92a3 or Q (1030) ge 85a2 also report that Pasenadi expressed his approval by listing the answers he had received, without, however, formulating his approval after each of the answers listed.
375 [[MN95]] at MN II 176,26.

In the Sa�yukta-āgama versions of the same discourse, however, on this occasion
King Pasenadi uses the respectful address “Blessed One” right from the outset. [380] This
suggests that, from the perspective of the Sa�yukta-āgama reciter tradition, King Pasenadi was already a disciple of the Buddha at the time of the Dahara-sutta. In fact according to the Madhyama-āgama collection, King Pasenadi’s going for refuge took
place in relation to the events described in the Piyajātika-sutta. [381] In keeping with this
perspective, the Chinese, Sanskrit, and Tibetan parallels to the Dahara-sutta only report that he rejoiced in the discourse, without declaring himself to have become a lay
disciple of the Buddha on this occasion. [382]
Hence, while from the viewpoint of the Theravāda tradition the Dahara-sutta would
have preceded the Ka��akatthala-sutta, from the perspective of the Sarvāstivāda tradition the Ka��akatthala-sutta should probably rather be placed before the meeting between Pasenadi and the Buddha described in the Dahara-sutta.
King Pasenadi’s first question in the Ka��akatthala-sutta and its parallels is whether
the Buddha had categorically stated omniscience to be impossible. [383] The Buddha de

382 [[SA1226]] at T II 335b7 and [[SA2]] 53 at T II 392a24 (on these two versions cf. also Choong 2006: 33), the
Sanskrit parallel in Gnoli 1977: 183,28, and the Tibetan parallel, the gzhon nu dpe’i mdo, D (296) mdo
sde, sha 297a1 or Q (962) lu 325b2, translated in Feer 1883: 138. According to the Tibetan (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinayavastu, however, Pasenadi was converted by means of the Dahara-sutta, D (1) ’dul ba,
ka 127b5 or Q (1030) khe 125b1: bcom ldan ’das kyis ko sa la’i rgyal po gsal rgyal gzhon nu’i dpe’i
mdo sdes btul ba; cf. also Feer 1874: 300.
383 The three versions agree on preceding the actual discussion by relating that two of Pasenadi’s wives
sent their regards to the Buddha. A minor difference is that in [[MA212]] at T I 793b13 the Buddha replies
by expressing his blessings not only for the welfare of the two wives, but also for 世尊 devas, asuras, gandhabbas and rakkhasas, a formulation used again in [[MA212]] at T I 792c26 to express the Buddha’s
blessings for the welfare of Pasenadi. This is a recurring pericope in the Madhyama-āgama, cf. also
[[MA28]] at T I 458c21, [[MA79]] at T I 549b25, [[MA134]] at T I 633c25, and [[MA161]] at T I 688b5. Although this pericope is not found in [[MN91]] at MN II 142 (parallel to [[MA161]]), [[MN127]] (which does
not have the whole episode found in [[MA79]]), or [[SN55.26]] at SN V 381 (parallel to [[MA28]] cf. below p.
821 note 1), a similar formulation occurs in [[DN21]] at DN II 269,17 (parallel to [[MA134]]): sukhakāmā hi
devā manussā asurā nāgā gandhabbā ye c’aññe santi puthukāyā ti. Another difference between [[MN90]]
and its parallels is that, while in [[MA212]] at T I 793b19 and D (1) ’dul ba, kha 88a2 or Q (1030) ge 81a7
King Pasenadi simply asks if the Buddha had made such a statement on the impossibility of omniscience, in [[MN90]] at MN II 127,3 he also asks if to attribute such a statement to the Buddha would not
provide grounds for censure, thereby making use of a standard pericope found in similar contexts in
other Majjhima-nikāya discourses, such as [[MN55]] at MN I 368,28, [[MN71]] at MN I 482,11, [[MN103]] at
MN II 243,11 (abbreviated version), and [[MN126]] at MN III 139,31. An equivalent to this pericope is
not found in the corresponding Chinese parallels, as [[MN55]] [[MN71]] and [[MN103]] do not appear to
have a Chinese parallel at all, and the parallel to [[MN126]] [[MA173]] at T I 710b2, does not record such a
statement. A similar statement can be found, e.g., in [[SA110]] at T II 35c15, in which case the parallel
[[MN35]] at MN I 230,1 does not have this passage. Alsdorf 1959: 319 explains that in the expression na
ca koci sahadhammiko vādānuvādo gārayha� �hāna� āgacchati, used in this pericope, �hāna� is nominative and subject together with vādānuvādo (he refers to [[AN7.35]] at AN II 31,20 and [[AN10.4]] at AN III
4,9, where both occur together in the nominative plural) and sahadhammiko qualifies both, so that the

nies this, explaining that he had only stated that it was impossible to know and see all
at one moment, i.e., simultaneously. [384]

MN II 128  The three versions continue by broaching the topic of the four classes, explaining that
the warrior and Brahmin classes are reckoned superior. The Pāli and Tibetan versions
make it clear that to speak of superiority only intends the homage and respect these two
classes receive. [385] In all versions, King Pasenadi clarifies that his question was not
about their present social status, but about their spiritual potential. [386] In reply, the Pāli
and Chinese versions declare that a member of any of the four classes would derive
great benefit from the five factors of striving. [387]
This is followed by a further inquiry if class would make a difference in regard to
possessing these five factors of striving. This query meets with the reply that the degree to which someone strives is what makes the difference, thereby indicating that
class has no direct influence on such matters. By way of illustration, all versions contrast tamed elephants, horses, and oxen with their untamed counterparts, thereby illustrating the tameability of members of different classes with the tameability of different
types of mammal. [388]


point made in this passage is if, by making such a statement, one will incur disapproval and reprehension that are justified (ibid. p. 323: “trifft sie nicht vielmehr irgendeine gemäß der (wahren) Lehre berechtigte Mißbilligung ihrer Lehre und (gemäß der wahren Lehre) tadelnswerte Konsequenz”?).
384 [[MN90]] at MN II 127,29: sakid eva sabbañ ñassati sabba� dakkhīti (Be-MN II 329,11, Ce-MN II 566,3,
and S [e] -MN II 520,12: sabba� and dakkhiti), [[MA212]] at T I 793c7:, and D
(1) ’dul ba, kha 88b1 or Q (1030) ge 81b6: thams cad shes pa’am, mthong ba gang yin pa. Such seems
to have been the conception of omniscience upheld in the Jain tradition, which Jaini 1979/1998: 267
explains to involve that “the Jina’s soul in fact perceives only itself. But the absence of karmic obstructions in such a soul means that ... all external objects will be reflected therein”. Schubring 1962/2000:
169 sums up that this then results in “cognition of all that is, was and will be”.
385 [[MN90]] at MN II 128,8 and D (1) ’dul ba, kha 88b4 or Q (1030) ge 82a1.
386 While in [[MN90]] at MN II 128,9 and D (1) ’dul ba, kha 88b5 or Q (1030) ge 82a2 this reaction by Pasenadi comes right after the Buddha’s reply, in [[MA212]] at T I 793c18 Pasenadi first praises the Buddha’s
reply, before indicating that it had failed to provide an answer to what he had on his mind. This is a recurrent pericope in [[MA212]] where King Pasenadi expresses his appreciation and politely requests to 一時知一切, 一時見一切
be allowed to put yet another question after each of the replies given by the Buddha, which in the present instance, however, fits the context less well.
387 The two discourses describe the five factors of striving in similar ways, differing in so far as [[MN90]] at
MN II 128,15 attributes them to a bhikkhu, while [[MA212]] at T I 793c29 has a learned noble disciple,
, as the subject. The Tibetan Bhai�ajyavastu version does not mention the five factors of
striving at this point and only takes them up later. Instead, D (1) ’dul ba, kha 88b7 or Q (1030) ge 82a4
highlights the importance of the Tathāgata’s role as the teacher, a condition mentioned also in [[MA212]]
at T I 793c27. This stipulation brings to mind [[MN85]] at MN II 95,30, which rounds off an exposition of
the five factors of striving by mentioning the need to be trained by the Tathāgata, tathāgata� vināyaka� labhamāno.
388 While the simile in [[MN90]] at MN II 129,4 lists only elephants, horses, and oxen, [[MA212]] at T I 794a29
and D (1) ’dul ba, kha 89a5 or Q (1030) ge 82a8 additionally mention “men”, /skyes bu (D: skyes
pa). The same image recurs in [[MN125]] at MN III 130,2, where again the parallel [[MA198]] at T I 757b13
lists “men” in addition to the elephants, horses, and oxen mentioned in the Pāli version. Thus, the num多聞聖弟子

MN II 129



The Ka��akatthala-sutta and its parallels next take up the related question if there is
a difference between the deliverance of members of the four classes, [389] explaining that
just as the colour and flames of fires lit by different types of wood are alike, so, too, the
deliverance reached by members of different classes is the same. [390]
The next question posed by King Pasenadi was if “there are devas”. [391] According to
the Pāli and Chinese versions, the Buddha asked Pasenadi to clarify what he meant



MN II 130



ber of living beings listed in [[MA212]] and the Bhai�ajyavastu version corresponds to the number of
classes that this image intends to illustrate.
389 According to [[MN90]] at MN II 129,1, in his first question King Pasenadi asked about members of the
four classes who possess the five factors of striving, while in the present instance at MN II 129,25 he
further qualifies their striving to be “right”, te c’ assu sammappadhānā, an expression the commentary
Ps III 359,13 relates to the attainment of the path, sammappadhānā ti maggapadhānena sammappadhānā. [[MA212]] at T I 794a21 reports that King Pasenadi at first asked: “is there a distinction [between]
these in regard to the practice of eradication”, This is followed in [[MA212]] at T I
794b16 by asking: “is there a distinction [between] these in regard to what is reckoned eradication”,
? The Tibetan Bhai�ajyavastu is more explicit in this respect, as according to D (1)
’dul ba, kha 89b4 or Q (1030) ge 82b7 at the present junction of events Pasenadi asked if there would
be a difference between their respective achievements of liberation, rnam par grol ba la khyad par
ram? The use in [[MA212]] of the character, “eradication”, reflects a recurrent tendency in the Madhyama-āgama to refer to pahāna or prahā�a, where the Pāli counterpart has padhāna, “striving”, such
as when rendering the four right efforts, sammappadhānā, as ; cf. also Bapat 1969: 5 and Minh
Chau 1964/1991: 327; for the same usage of in a text by Ān Shìgāo ( ) cf. Deleanu 2003: 68
note 15; for a more detailed discussion cf. Gethin 1992a: 69-72. The corresponding samyakprahā�a
can be found, e.g., in SHT I 614 folio bV5-R1 此有差別於斷行耶? (p. 273), in the Arthaviniścaya-sūtra in Samtani 1971:
29,1, in the Divyāvadāna in Cowell 1886: 208,8 or in Vaidya 1999: 129,10, in the Lalitavistara in
此有差別謂斷耶 Hokazono 1994: 282,9 or in Lefmann 1902: 8,5 or in Vaidya 1958b: 7,6, and in a Mahāparinirvā�asūtra fragment [[SN360]] folio 180V5 in Waldschmidt 1950: 23. In contrast, the expression samyakpradhāna can be found, e.g., in the Mahāvastu in Basak 1968/2004: 74,14 or Senart 1897: 120,14, or in the
Saundaranandakāvya 17.24 in Johnston 1928: 127, 斷 15. Particularly noteworthy is a reference to the effort of eradicating unwholesome states in [[SA876]] at T II 221a16 as, which would be a counterpart
to prahā�aprahā�a, found, e.g., in SHT V 1445 V1 or in the Śrāvakabhūmi 四正斷, Shukla 1973: 312,19 or ŚSG
2007: 208,15, where the Chinese counterpart, T 1579 at T XXX 443a 斷 23, indeed reads 安世高 . The corresponding Pāli expression pahānapadhāna can be found, e.g., in [[DN33]] at DN III 225,27. Another variation along the same lines occurs in [[MA189]] at T I 736b10, where a passage that takes up the development of the right effort speaks of, which in the Pāli standard presentations has as its counterpart the
verb padahati, cf. also Meisig 1987a: 222.
390 [[MN90]] at MN II 129,28. In [[MA212]] at T I 794b18 and D (1) ’dul ba, kha 89b5 or Q (1030) ge 82b8 the
simile is further developed, as these two versions describe members of each of the four classes that come
from one of the cardinal directions with a particular type of wood to make a fire, an image found also in
[[MN93]] at MN II 152,2 and in [[MN96]] at MN II 183,13. Another minor difference is that, while [[MN90]] 斷斷
and the Tibetan Bhai�ajyavastu version speak of four different types of wood, according to [[MA212]] at
T I 794b19+20 the warrior and the Brahmin use the same dry sāla wood, . 斷斷
391 [[MN90]] at MN II 130,13: atthi devā ti?, [[MA212]] at T I 794c8:, and D (1) ’dul ba, kha 90b1 or
Q (1030) ge 83b2: lha rnams mchis sam? Thus, the Chinese and Tibetan versions do not support the
emendation to atthi adhideva suggested by Norman 1985: 150. The same is also the case for [[MN90]] at 滅
MN II 132,2: atthi Brahmā?, as [[MA212]] at T I 795a20 reads, and D (1) ’dul ba, kha 91b3 or Q

with this question, [392] in reply to which Pasenadi explained that he wanted to know if
devas are subject to rebirth in the human realm.
According to the Madhyama-āgama account, [393] before the Buddha could reply to this
question a general from King Pasenadi’s retinue interrupted the discussion, an intervention also recorded in the Pāli and Tibetan versions, although according to these versions this intervention took place after the Buddha had replied. [394] This perhaps a little
impolite way of interrupting a discussion between the king and the Buddha prompted
Ānanda to join the discussion, in order to reply to the general in place of the Buddha.
The three versions describe in similar terms how Ānanda illustrated the impossibility
that devas subject to affliction could oust devas free from affliction with the example of
King Pasenadi’s inability to banish anyone from the heaven of the Thirty-three. [395]


atthi adhibrahmā. While in [[MN90]] at MN II 132,26+29 Pasenadi uses the expressions adhideve and
adhibrahmāna� when expressing his appreciation of the Buddha’s replies, in the corresponding passage in [[MA212]] at T I 795b9 Pasenadi does not refer to the discussion on the devas at all, and in relation to the discussion on Brahmās he again speaks just of, corresponding to atthi Brahmā. The Tibetan Bhai�ajyavastu, however, agrees in this respect with the Pāli version, as according to D (1) ’dul
ba, kha 92a4 or Q (1030) ge 85a3 the king in his concluding remark referred to lhag pa’i lha and lhag
pa’i tshangs pa.
392 [[MN90]] at MN II 130,14 and [[MA212]] at T I 794c8, while the Tibetan version does not record such a
counterquestion. Marasinghe 1974: 125 comments that “while the first one questions the validity of the
belief in the gods itself, the second ... inquires as to whether the gods come to be reborn in the human
world, thus accepting that the gods are there, this being the very basic premise that was queried in the
first one”. Yet, according to [[SN22.3]] at SN I 75,31 (or SN [2] 120 at SN [2] I 172,6) King Pasenadi once prepared a great sacrifice (a passage noted by Marasinghe himself), which suggests that he did believe in
the existence of gods. Moreover, according to [[MN90]] King Pasenadi and his general went along with- 有梵
out objection when Ānanda brought up the example of the gods of the Thirty-three, a passage which
suggests that, although the two had never seen the devas of the Thirty-three, they both accepted their
existence. Perhaps the discrepancy between the two questions is not as strong as Marasinghe suggests,
in fact, if Pasenadi had wanted to question the validity of the belief in gods, there seems to be no reason
why he should not have expressed this openly when the Buddha asked him to clarify what his question
was about. For yet another interpretation of the present passage, based on assuming that King Pasenadi
inquired after his own position as a king (adhideva) and a possible threat to this position by Vi�ū�abha,
cf. Ireland 1990a: 78.
393 In [[MA212]] at T I 794c9 Pasenadi asks if afflicted devas were reborn in this world and devas free from
affliction were beyond being reborn in this world. Thus, [[MA212]] attributes to Pasenadi’s question what
according to [[MN90]] was the Buddha’s answer.
394 While in [[MN90]] at MN II 130,21 the general addresses the Buddha, according to D (1) ’dul ba, kha
90b6 or Q (1030) ge 83b7 he addresses the king. On this general cf. also Bareau 1993: 28-29.
395 Neumann 1896/1995: 1114 note 236 suggests that the general’s question if devas subject to affliction
could oust devas free from affliction could have in mind the wars between devas and asuras. References to such wars can be found repeatedly in the Pāli discourses, cf., e.g., [[DN21]] at DN II 285,6, [[MN37]] at MN I 253,2, [[SN11.3]] at at SN I 218,31 (or SN [2] 249 at SN [2] I 472,6), [[SN11.4]] at SN I 221,1 (or SN [2]

250 at SN [2] I 475,8), [[SN11.5]] at SN I 222,22 (or SN [2] 251 at SN [2] I 480,3), [[SN11.6]] at SN I 224,17 (or
SN [2] 252 at SN [2] I 483,8), [[SN11.10]] at SN I 227,7 (or SN [2] 256 at SN [2] I 489,6), [[SN35.207]] at SN IV
201,18, [[SN56.41]] at SN V 447,25, and [[AN9.39]] at AN IV 432,3. Witanachchi 2005a: 321 explains that
“the myth of the Deva-Asura battle, as portrayed in Buddhist literature, is ... a symbolic representation


Chapter 9 Rāja-vagga                                        -  525


Pasenadi expressed his appreciation of Ānanda’s reply and then asked the Buddha if MN II 132
“there are Brahmās”, a question intended to find out if Brahmās were subject to human
rebirth. At this point a messenger arrived, reporting the arrival of the person that Pasenadi had summoned earlier, in order to find out who had misrepresented the Buddha’s
position on omniscience. [396] The investigation into this matter was not yet completed
when another attendant informed the king that it was time to leave. [397] Pasenadi thereon
expressed his appreciation for the answers he had received from the Buddha and left. [398]


of the conflict between good and evil in the human mind and in human society”. The topic of the abilities of impure devas vis-à-vis pure devas is also taken up in the Jain Viyāhapa��atti 6.9.144 in Lalwani
1974: 308,22, suggesting that such topics were of considerable interest in ancient India.
396 While according to [[MA212]] at T I 795a24 the messenger arrived before the Buddha could give a full reply to King Pasenadi’s question, according to [[MN90]] at MN II 132,10 the Buddha had answered Pasenadi’s question before the messenger arrived. D (1) ’dul ba, kha 91b5 or Q (1030) ge 84b4 reports that
the Buddha had answered Pasenadi’s question about Brahmās, but then Pasenadi asked yet another question on the same theme and the messenger arrived before the Buddha could answer this other question.
397 [[MN90]] at MN II 132,19: yānakālo, [[MA212]] at T I 795b4:, and D (1) ’dul ba,
kha 92a2 or Q (1030) ge 85a1: gshegs pa’i dus la bab lags so. This announcement fits well with the
subsequent occurrence in [[MN90]] at MN II 133,1, [[MA212]] at T I 795b11, and D (1) ’dul ba, kha 92a5 or
Q (1030) ge 85a4 of a standard pericope for taking leave after a visit, according to which Pasenadi announced that he had much to do. Manné 1993: 36, based on surveying instances of the use of this pericope in the Pāli Nikāyas, concludes that this “formula is quite simply a standard means of polite leavetaking ... a conventional means to end a conversation and to enable a polite departure”. Although in
some circumstances one might have the impression that it conveys a sense of self-importance on the
side of the speaker, according to Manné 1993: 38 its general usage is as “an excuse for going, but without self-importance ... the speaker is going somewhat against his will ... he is obliged to go. It is all very
polite and conventional”. 嚴駕已至, 天王當知時
398 While [[MN90]] at MN II 133,4 and D (1) ’dul ba, kha 92a6 or Q (1030) ge 85a5 only mention that King
Pasenadi rejoiced in the discourse, [[MA212]] at T I 795b14 reports that Ānanda and the whole great assembly,, also rejoiced in the Buddha’s exposition.

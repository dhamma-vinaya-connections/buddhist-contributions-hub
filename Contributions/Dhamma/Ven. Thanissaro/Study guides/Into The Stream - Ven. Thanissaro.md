# The Way to Stream Entry

The Pali Canon recognizes four levels of Awakening, the
    first of which is called stream entry. This gains its name from
    the fact that a person who has attained this level has entered
    the “stream” flowing inevitably to nibbana. He/she is
    guaranteed to achieve full awakening within seven lifetimes at
    most, and in the interim will not be reborn in any of the lower
    realms.

This study guide on stream entry is divided into two parts.
    The first deals with the practices leading to stream entry; the
    second, with the experience of stream entry and its
    results.

The practices leading to stream entry are encapsulated in
    four factors:

Association with people of integrity is a factor for stream
    entry.

Listening to the true Dhamma is a factor for stream
    entry.

Appropriate attention is a factor for stream entry.

Practice in accordance with the Dhamma is a factor for
    stream entry.

—[[SN55.5]]

These factors form the framework for the first part of this
    study guide.

The Canon’s treatment of these factors touches on questions
    of interest to all meditators, regardless of whether their
    practice aims all the way to Awakening: How can you recognize a
    trustworthy teacher? How can you tell the true Dhamma from
    counterfeit Dhamma? What are the rewards that come from
    listening to the Dhamma? Which questions should you ask
    yourself in the course of the practice? What kind of practice
    qualifies as being in accordance with the Dhamma? What kind of
    qualities do you need to develop to benefit most from your
    practice?

For your practice to lead to Awakening, you must develop
    reliable standards for answering these questions. The Buddha
    offers some preliminary guidance on developing these standards
    in his instructions to the brahman teenager, Kapadika
    Bharadvaja.

Kapadika Bharadvaja: “To what extent is there an awakening to
  the truth? To what extent does one awaken to the truth? We ask
  Master Gotama about awakening to the truth.”

The Buddha: “There is the case, Bharadvaja, where a monk lives
  in dependence on a certain village or town. Then a householder or
  householder’s son goes to him and observes him with regard to
  three mental qualities—qualities based on greed, qualities based
  on aversion, qualities based on delusion: ‘Are there in this
  venerable one any such qualities based on greed that, with his
  mind overcome by these qualities, he might say, “I know,” while
  not knowing, or say, “I see,” while not seeing; or that he might
  urge another to act in a way that was for his/her long-term harm
  & pain?’ As he observes him, he comes to know, ‘There are in this
  venerable one no such qualities based on greed…. His bodily
  behavior & verbal behavior are those of one not greedy. And the
  Dhamma he teaches is deep, hard to see, hard to realize,
  tranquil, refined, beyond the scope of conjecture, subtle,
  to-be-experienced by the wise. This Dhamma can’t easily be taught
  by a person who’s greedy.

“When, on observing that the monk is purified with regard to
  qualities based on greed, he next observes him with regard to
  qualities based on aversion… based on delusion: ‘Are there in
  this venerable one any such qualities based on delusion that,
  with his mind overcome by these qualities, he might say, “I
  know,” while not knowing, or say, “I see,” while not seeing; or
  that he might urge another to act in a way that was for his/her
  long-term harm & pain?’ As he observes him, he comes to know,
  ‘There are in this venerable one no such qualities based on
  delusion…. His bodily behavior & verbal behavior are those of one
  not deluded. And the Dhamma he teaches is deep, hard to see, hard
  to realize, tranquil, refined, beyond the scope of conjecture,
  subtle, to-be-experienced by the wise. This Dhamma can’t easily
  be taught by a person who’s deluded.

“When, on observing that the monk is purified with regard to
  qualities based on delusion, he places conviction in him. With
  the arising of conviction, he visits him & grows close to him.
  Growing close to him, he lends ear. Lending ear, he hears the
  Dhamma. Hearing the Dhamma, he remembers it. Remembering it, he
  penetrates the meaning of those dhammas. Penetrating the meaning,
  he comes to an agreement through pondering those dhammas. There
  being an agreement through pondering those dhammas, desire
  arises. With the arising of desire, he becomes willing. Willing,
  he contemplates [lit: “weighs,” “compares”]. Contemplating, he
  makes an exertion. Exerting himself, he both realizes the
  ultimate meaning of the truth with his body and sees by
  penetrating it with discernment.

“To this extent, Bharadvaja, there is an awakening to the
  truth. To this extent one awakens to the truth. I describe this
  as an awakening to the truth. But it is not yet the final
  attainment of the truth.”

Kapadika Bharadvaja: “Yes, Master Gotama, to this extent there
  is an awakening to the truth. To this extent one awakens to the
  truth. We regard this as an awakening to the truth. But to what
  extent is there the final attainment of the truth? To what extent
  does one finally attain the truth? We ask Master Gotama about the
  final attainment of the truth.”

The Buddha: “The cultivation, development, & pursuit of those
  very same qualities: to this extent, Bharadvaja, there is the
  final attainment of the truth. To this extent one finally attains
  the truth. I describe this as the final attainment of the
  truth.”

—[[MN95]]

## Association with People of Integrity ^sigil_toc_id_1

“With regard to external factors, I don’t envision any other
  single factor like friendship with admirable people as doing so
  much for a monk in training, who has not attained the goal but
  remains intent on the unsurpassed safety from bondage. A monk who
  is a friend with admirable people abandons what is unskillful and
  develops what is skillful.”

A monk who is a friend

to admirable people

—who’s reverential, respectful,

doing what his friends advise—

mindful, alert,

attains step by step

the ending of all fetters.

—[[ITI17]]

As he was seated to one side, Ven. Ananda said to the Blessed
  One, “This is half of the holy life, lord: having admirable
  people as friends, companions, & colleagues.”

“Don’t say that, Ananda. Don’t say that. Having admirable
  people as friends, companions, & colleagues is actually the whole
  of the holy life. When a monk has admirable people as friends,
  companions, & colleagues, he can be expected to develop & pursue
  the noble eightfold path.

“And how does a monk who has admirable people as friends,
  companions, & colleagues, develop & pursue the noble eightfold
  path? There is the case where a monk develops right view
  dependent on seclusion, dependent on dispassion, dependent on
  cessation, resulting in letting go. He develops right resolve…
  right speech… right action… right livelihood… right effort… right
  mindfulness… right concentration dependent on seclusion…
  dispassion… cessation, resulting in letting go. This is how a
  monk who has admirable people as friends, companions, &
  colleagues, develops & pursues the noble eightfold path.

“And through this line of reasoning one may know how having
  admirable people as friends, companions, & colleagues is actually
  the whole of the holy life: It’s in dependence on me as an
  admirable friend that beings subject to birth have gained release
  from birth, that beings subject to aging have gained release from
  aging, that beings subject to death have gained release from
  death, that beings subject to sorrow, lamentation, pain,
  distress, & despair have gained release from sorrow, lamentation,
  pain, distress, & despair.”

—[[SN45.2]]

“And what does it mean to have admirable people as friends?
  There is the case where a lay person, in whatever town or village
  he may dwell, spends time with householders or householders’
  sons, young or old, who are advanced in virtue. He talks with
  them, engages them in discussions. He emulates consummate
  conviction in those who are consummate in conviction, consummate
  virtue in those who are consummate in virtue, consummate
  generosity in those who are consummate in generosity, and
  consummate discernment in those who are consummate in
  discernment. This is called having admirable people as
  friends….

“And what does it mean to be consummate in conviction? There
  is the case where a noble disciple has conviction, is convinced
  of the Tathagata’s Awakening: ‘Indeed, the Blessed One is worthy
  & rightly self-awakened, consummate in knowledge and conduct,
  well-gone, an expert with regard to the world, unexcelled as a
  trainer for those people fit to be tamed, the Teacher of devas &
  human beings, awakened, blessed.’ This is called being consummate
  in conviction.

“And what does it mean to be consummate in virtue? There is
  the case where a noble disciple abstains from taking life,
  abstains from stealing, abstains from illicit sexual conduct,
  abstains from lying, abstains from taking intoxicants that cause
  heedlessness. This is called being consummate in virtue.

“And what does it mean to be consummate in generosity? There
  is the case of a noble disciple, his awareness cleansed of the
  stain of miserliness, living at home, freely generous,
  openhanded, delighting in being magnanimous, responsive to
  requests, delighting in the distribution of alms. This is called
  being consummate in generosity.

“And what does it mean to be consummate in discernment? There
  is the case where a noble disciple is discerning, endowed with
  discernment of arising and passing away—noble, penetrating,
  leading to the right ending of stress. This is called being
  consummate in discernment.”

—[[AN8.54]]

Admirable friends are to be recognized both by what they say
    and by what they do.

 
“For the person who transgresses in one thing, I tell you,
  there is no evil deed that is not to be done. Which one thing?
  This: telling a deliberate lie.”

The person who lies,

who transgress in this one thing,

transcending concern for the world beyond:

there’s no evil

he might not do.

—[[ITI25]]

“A friend endowed with these three qualities is worth
  associating with. Which three? He/she gives what is hard to give,
  does what is hard to do, endures what is hard to endure. A friend
  endowed with these three qualities is worth associating
  with.”

—[[AN3.133]]

“These three things have been promulgated by wise people, by
  people who are truly good. Which three? Generosity…going-forth
  [from the home life]…& service to one’s mother & father. These
  three things have been promulgated by wise people, by people who
  are truly good.”

—[[AN5.41]]

“Now what is the level of a person of no integrity? A person
  of no integrity is ungrateful, does not acknowledge the help
  given to him. This ingratitude, this lack of acknowledgment is
  second nature among rude people. It is entirely on the level of
  people of no integrity. A person of integrity is grateful &
  acknowledges the help given to him. This gratitude, this
  acknowledgment is second nature among admirable people. It is
  entirely on the level of people of integrity.”

—[[AN2.31]]

“A person endowed with these four qualities can be known as ‘a
  person of integrity.’ Which four?

“There is the case where a person of integrity, when asked,
  doesn’t reveal another person’s bad points, to say nothing of
  when unasked. Furthermore, when asked, when pressed with
  questions, he is one who speaks of another person’s bad points
  not in full, not in detail, with omissions, holding back….

“Then again, a person of integrity, when unasked, reveals
  another person’s good points, to say nothing of when asked.
  Furthermore, when asked, when pressed with questions, he is one
  who speaks of another person’s good points in full & in detail,
  without omissions, without holding back….

“Then again, a person of integrity, when unasked, reveals his
  own bad points, to say nothing of when asked. Furthermore, when
  asked, when pressed with questions, he is one who speaks of his
  own bad points in full & in detail, without omissions, without
  holding back….

“Then again, a person of integrity, when asked, doesn’t reveal
  his own good points, to say nothing of when unasked. Furthermore,
  when asked, when pressed with questions, he is one who speaks of
  his own good points not in full, not in detail, with omissions,
  holding back….

“Monks, a person endowed with these four qualities can be
  known as ‘a person of integrity.’”

—[[AN4.73]]

[1] “‘It’s through living together that a person’s virtue may
  be known, and then only after a long period, not a short period;
  by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; by one
  who is discerning, not by one who is not discerning’: Thus it was
  said. And in reference to what was it said?

“There is the case where one individual, through living with
  another, knows this: ‘For a long time this person has been torn,
  broken, spotted, splattered in his actions. He hasn’t been
  consistent in his actions. He hasn’t practiced consistently with
  regard to the precepts. He is an unprincipled person, not a
  virtuous, principled one.’ And then there is the case where one
  individual, through living with another, knows this: ‘For a long
  time this person has been untorn, unbroken, unspotted,
  unsplattered in his actions. He has been consistent in his
  actions. He has practiced consistently with regard to the
  precepts. He is a virtuous, principled person, not an
  unprincipled one.’

“‘It’s through living together that a person’s virtue may be
  known, and then only after a long period, not a short period; by
  one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; by one who
  is discerning, not by one who is not discerning’: Thus it was
  said. And in reference to this was it said.

[2] “‘It’s through dealing with a person that his purity may
  be known, and then only after a long period, not a short period;
  by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; by one
  who is discerning, not by one who is not discerning’: Thus it was
  said. And in reference to what was it said?

“There is the case where one individual, through dealing with
  another, knows this: ‘This person deals one way when one-on-one,
  another way when with two, another way when with three, another
  way when with many. His earlier dealings do not jibe with his
  later dealings. He is impure in his dealings, not pure.’ And then
  there is the case where one individual, through dealing with
  another, knows this: ‘The way this person deals when one-on-one,
  is the same way he deals when with two, when with three, when
  with many. His earlier dealings jibe with his later dealings. He
  is pure in his dealings, not impure.’

“‘It’s through dealing with a person that his purity may be
  known, and then only after a long period, not a short period; by
  one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; by one who
  is discerning, not by one who is not discerning’: Thus it was
  said. And in reference to this was it said.

[3] “‘It’s through adversity that a person’s endurance may be
  known, and then only after a long period, not a short period; by
  one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; by one who
  is discerning, not by one who is not discerning’: Thus it was
  said. And in reference to what was it said?

“There is the case where a person, suffering loss of
  relatives, loss of wealth, or loss through disease, does not
  reflect: ‘That’s how it is when living together in the world.
  That’s how it is when gaining a personal identity
  *[atta-bhava*, literally “self-state”]. When there is
  living in the world, when there is the gaining of a personal
  identity, these eight worldly conditions spin after the world,
  and the world spins after these eight worldly conditions: gain,
  loss, status, disgrace, censure, praise, pleasure, & pain.’
  Suffering loss of relatives, loss of wealth, or loss through
  disease, he sorrows, grieves, & laments, beats his breast,
  becomes distraught. And then there is the case where a person,
  suffering loss of relatives, loss of wealth, or loss through
  disease, reflects: ‘That’s how it is when living together in the
  world. That’s how it is when gaining a personal identity. When
  there is living in the world, when there is the gaining of a
  personal identity, these eight worldly conditions spin after the
  world, and the world spins after these eight worldly conditions:
  gain, loss, status, disgrace, censure, praise, pleasure, & pain.’
  Suffering loss of relatives, loss of wealth, or loss through
  disease, he does not sorrow, grieve, or lament, does not beat his
  breast or become distraught.

“‘It’s through adversity that a person’s endurance may be
  known, and then only after a long period, not a short period; by
  one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; by one who
  is discerning, not by one who is not discerning’: Thus it was
  said. And in reference to this was it said.

[4] “‘It’s through discussion that a person’s discernment may
  be known, and then only after a long period, not a short period;
  by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; by one
  who is discerning, not by one who is not discerning’: Thus it was
  said. And in reference to what was it said?

“There is the case where one individual, through discussion
  with another, knows this: ‘From the way this person rises to an
  issue, from the way he applies [his reasoning], from the way he
  addresses a question, he is dull, not discerning. Why is that? He
  does not make statements that are deep, tranquil, refined, beyond
  the scope of conjecture, subtle, to-be-experienced by the wise.
  He cannot declare the meaning, teach it, describe it, set it
  forth, reveal it, explain it, or make it plain. He is dull, not
  discerning.’ Just as if a man with good eyesight standing on the
  shore of a body of water were to see a small fish rise. The
  thought would occur to him, ‘From the rise of this fish, from the
  break of its ripples, from its speed, it is a small fish, not a
  large one.’ In the same way, one individual, in discussion with
  another, knows this: ‘From the way this person rises to an issue,
  from the way he applies [his reasoning], from the way he
  addresses a question… he is dull, not discerning.’

“And then there is the case where one individual, through
  discussion with another, knows this: ‘From the way this person

  said. And in reference to this was it said.”

—[[AN4.192]]

In addition to requiring time and clear powers of
    observation, the ability to recognize a person of integrity
    requires that you be a person of integrity as well.

 
“Monks, could a person of no integrity know of a person of no
  integrity: ‘This is a person of no integrity’?”

“No, lord.”

“Good, monks. It’s impossible, there’s no way, that a person
  of no integrity would know of a person of no integrity: ‘This is
  a person of no integrity.’

“Could a person of no integrity know of a person of integrity:
  ‘This is a person of integrity’?”

“No, lord.”

“Good, monks. It’s impossible, there’s no way, that a person
  of no integrity would know of a person of integrity: ‘This is a
  person of integrity.’”….

“Now, monks, could a person of integrity know of a person of
  no integrity: ‘This is a person of no integrity’?”

“Yes, lord.”

“Good, monks. It is possible that a person of integrity would
  know of a person of no integrity: ‘This is a person of no
  integrity.’

“Could a person of integrity know of a person of integrity:
  ‘This is a person of integrity’?”

“Yes, lord.”

“Good, monks. It is possible that a person of integrity would
  know of a person of integrity: ‘This is a person of
  integrity.’

“A person of integrity is endowed with qualities of integrity;
  he is a person of integrity in his friendship, in the way he
  wills, the way he gives advice, the way he speaks, the way he
  acts, the views he holds, & the way he gives a gift.

“And how is a person of integrity endowed with qualities of
  integrity? There is the case where a person of integrity is
  endowed with conviction, conscience, concern; he is learned, with
  aroused persistence, unmuddled mindfulness, & good discernment.
  This is how a person of integrity is endowed with qualities of
  integrity.

“And how is a person of integrity a person of integrity in his
  friendship? There is the case where a person of integrity has, as
  his friends & companions, those contemplatives & brahmans who are
  endowed with conviction, shame, compunction; who are learned,
  with aroused persistence, unmuddled mindfulness, & good
  discernment. This is how a person of integrity is a person of
  integrity in his friendship.

“And how is a person of integrity a person of integrity in the
  way he wills? There is the case where a person of integrity wills
  neither for his own affliction, nor for the affliction of others,
  nor for the affliction of both. This is how a person of integrity
  is a person of integrity in the way he wills.

“And how is a person of integrity a person of integrity in the
  way he gives advice? There is the case where a person of
  integrity gives advice neither for his own affliction, nor for
  the affliction of others, nor for the affliction of both. This is
  how a person of integrity is a person of integrity in the way he
  gives advice.

“And how is a person of integrity a person of integrity in the
  way he speaks? There is the case where a person of integrity is
  one who refrains from lies, refrains from divisive tale-bearing,
  refrains from harsh speech, refrains from idle chatter. This is
  how a person of integrity is a person of integrity in the way he
  speaks.

“And how is a person of integrity a person of integrity in the
  way he acts? There is the case where a person of integrity is one
  who refrains from taking life, refrains from stealing, refrains
  from illicit sex. This is how a person of integrity is a person
  of integrity in the way he acts.

“And how is a person of integrity a person of integrity in the
  views he holds? There is the case where a person of integrity is
  one who holds a view like this: ‘There is what is given, what is
  offered, what is sacrificed. There are fruits & results of good &
  bad actions. There is this world & the next world. There is
  mother & father. There are spontaneously reborn beings; there are
  contemplatives & brahmans who, faring rightly & practicing
  rightly, proclaim this world & the next after having directly
  known & realized it for themselves.’ This is how a person of
  integrity is a person of integrity in the views he holds.

“And how is a person of integrity a person of integrity in the
  way he gives a gift? There is the case where a person of
  integrity gives a gift attentively, with his own hand,
  respectfully, not as if throwing it away, with the view that
  something will come of it. This is how a person of integrity is a
  person of integrity in the way he gives a gift.

“This person of integrity—thus endowed with qualities of
  integrity; a person of integrity in his friendship, in the way he
  wills, the way he gives advice, the way he speaks, the way he
  acts, the views he holds, & the way he gives a gift—on the
  break-up of the body, after death, reappears in the destination
  of people of integrity. And what is the destination of people of
  integrity? Greatness among devas or among human beings.”

## Listening to the True Dhamma ^sigil_toc_id_2

The opportunity to listen to the Dhamma is considered
    valuable both because it is rare and because it yields great
    benefits.

 

Hard the chance to hear the true Dhamma.

—[[DHP|DHP182]]

“There are these five rewards in listening to the Dhamma.
  Which five?

“[1] One hears what one has not heard before. [2] One
  clarifies what one has heard before. [3] One gets rid of doubt.
  [4] One’s views are made straight. [5] One’s mind grows calm.

“These are the five rewards in listening to the Dhamma.”

—[[AN5.202]]

To obtain these benefits, one must come to the Dhamma both
    with the right karmic background and with the right
    attitude.

 
“Endowed with these six qualities, a person is capable of
  alighting on the lawfulness, the rightness of skillful mental
  qualities even while listening to the true Dhamma. Which six?

“He is not endowed with a (present) kamma obstruction, a
  defilement obstruction, or a result-of-(past)-kamma obstruction;
  he has conviction, has the desire (to listen), and is
  discerning.

“Endowed with these six qualities, a person is capable of
  alighting on the lawfulness, the rightness of skillful mental
  qualities even while listening to the true Dhamma.”

—[[AN6.86]]

“With what virtue,

what behavior,

nurturing      what
    actions,

would a person become rightly based

and attain the ultimate goal?”

“One should be respectful

of one’s superiors[[#^Sn2.9note01|1]]

& not envious;

should have a sense of the time

for seeing teachers;[[#^Sn2.9note02|2]]

should value the opportunity

when a talk on Dhamma’s in progress;

should listen intently

to well-spoken words;

should go at the proper time,

humbly, casting off stubbornness,

to one’s teacher’s presence;

should both recollect & follow

the Dhamma, its meaning,

restraint, & the holy life.

 

Delighting
      in      Dhamma,

savoring      Dhamma,

established
      in      Dhamma,

with a sense of how

to
      investigate      Dhamma,

one should not speak in ways

destructive
      of      Dhamma,[[#^Sn2.9note03|3]]

should guide oneself

with true, well-spoken words.

 

Shedding

      hilarity,      chattering,

      lamentation,      hatred,

deception,      deceit,

greed,      pride,

      confrontation,      roughness,

      astringency,      infatuation,

one should go about free

of intoxication,

steadfast within.

 

Understanding’s the heartwood

of well-spoken words;

concentration, the heartwood

of learning & understanding.

 

When a person is hasty & heedless

his discernment & learning

don’t grow.

While those who delight

in the doctrines taught by the noble ones,

are unexcelled

in word, action, & mind.

They, established in

calm,

composure, &

concentration,

have reached

what discernment & learning

have as their heartwood.”[[#^Sn2.9note04|4]]

 
 
—[[SN12.9]]

Notes

 
1. According to the Commentary, one’s
    superiors include those who have more wisdom than oneself, more
    skill in concentration and other aspects of the path than
    oneself, and those senior to oneself. ^[[SN12.9]]note01

2. The Commentary says that the right time
    to see a teacher is when one is overcome with passion,
    aversion, and delusion, and cannot find a way out on one’s own.
    This echoes a passage in [[AN6.26]] in which Ven. Maha Kaccana
    says that the right time to visit a “monk worthy of esteem” is
    when one needs help in overcoming any of the five hindrances or
    when one doesn’t yet have an appropriate theme to focus on to
    put an end to the mind’s effluents. ^[[SN12.9]]note02

3. The Commentary equates “words
    destructive of the Dhamma” with “animal talk.” See the
    discussion under [[BU-PC85]] in *The Buddhist Monastic
        Code.* ^[[SN12.9]]note03

4. The heartwood of learning & discernment
    is release. ^[[SN12.9]]note04

 

Ven. Yasadatta:

Intent on quibbling,

the dullard hears the Conqueror’s teaching.

He’s as far from the True Dhamma

as the ground is from the sky.

 

Intent on quibbling,

the dullard hears the Conqueror’s teaching.

 

He wanes from the True Dhamma

like the moon in the dark half of the
      month.

 

Intent on quibbling,

the dullard hears the Conqueror’s teaching.

 

He dries up in the True Dhamma

like a fish in next to no water.

 

Intent on quibbling,

the dullard hears the Conqueror’s teaching.

 

He doesn’t grow in the True Dhamma,

like a rotten seed in a field.

 

But whoever hears the Conqueror’s teaching

with guarded intent,

doing away with effluents

—all—

realizing the unshakable,

attaining the foremost peace,

is—effluent-free—

totally unbound.

 
 
—[[THAG5]].10

It’s also important to understand clearly the standards for
    distinguishing true Dhamma from false. These standards come
    down to a pragmatic test: How does one behave, and what results
    come from one’s behavior, when one puts the Dhamma into
    practice?

 
As they were sitting to one side, the Kalamas of Kesaputta
  said to the Blessed One, “Venerable sir, there are some
  contemplatives & brahmans who come to Kesaputta. They expound &
  glorify their own doctrines, but as for the doctrines of others,
  they deprecate them, revile them, show contempt for them, &
  disparage them. And then other contemplatives & brahmans come to
  Kesaputta. They expound & glorify their own doctrines, but as for
  the doctrines of others, they deprecate them, revile them, show
  contempt for them, & disparage them. They leave us simply
  uncertain & doubtful: Which of these venerable contemplatives &
  brahmans are speaking the truth, and which ones are lying?”

“Of course you are uncertain, Kalamas. Of course you are
  doubtful. When there are reasons for doubt, uncertainty is born.
  So in this case, Kalamas, don’t go by reports, by legends, by
  traditions, by scripture, by conjecture, by inference, by
  analogies, by agreement through pondering views, by probability,
  or by the thought, ‘This contemplative is our teacher.’ When you
  know for yourselves that, ‘These qualities are unskillful; these
  qualities are blameworthy; these qualities are criticized by the
  wise; these qualities, when undertaken & carried out, lead to
  harm & to suffering’—then you should abandon them…

“What do you think, Kalamas: When greed arises in a person,
  does it arise for welfare or for harm?”

“For harm, lord.”

“And this greedy person, overcome by greed, his mind possessed
  by greed: Doesn’t he kill living beings, take what is not given,
  go after another person’s wife, tell lies, and induce others to
  do likewise, all of which is for long-term harm & suffering?”

“Yes, lord.”

[Similarly for aversion & delusion.]

“So what do you think, Kalamas: Are these qualities skillful
  or unskillful?”

“Unskillful, lord.”

“Blameworthy or blameless?”

“Blameworthy, lord.”

“Criticized by the wise or praised by the wise?”

“Criticized by the wise, lord.”

“When undertaken & carried out, do they lead to harm & to
  suffering, or not?”

“When undertaken & carried out, they lead to harm & to
  suffering…”

“…Now, Kalamas, don’t go by reports, by legends, by
  traditions, by scripture, by conjecture, by inference, by
  analogies, by agreement through pondering views, by probability,
  or by the thought, ‘This contemplative is our teacher.’ When you
  know for yourselves that, ‘These qualities are skillful; these
  qualities are blameless; these qualities are praised by the wise;
  these qualities, when undertaken & carried out, lead to welfare &
  to happiness’—then you should enter & remain in them.

“What do you think, Kalamas: When lack of greed arises in a
  person, does it arise for welfare or for harm?”

“For welfare, lord.”

“And this ungreedy person, not overcome by greed, his mind not
  possessed by greed: He doesn’t kill living beings, take what is
  not given, go after another person’s wife, tell lies, or induce
  others to do likewise, all of which is for long-term welfare &
  happiness—right?”

“Yes, lord.”

[Similarly for lack of aversion & lack of delusion.]

“So what do you think, Kalamas: Are these qualities skillful
  or unskillful?”

“Skillful, lord.”

“Blameworthy or blameless?”

“Blameless, lord.”

“Criticized by the wise or praised by the wise?”

“Praised by the wise, lord.”

“When undertaken & carried out, do they lead to welfare & to
  happiness, or not?”

“When undertaken & carried out, they lead to welfare & to
  happiness…”

—[[AN3.66]]

“Gotami, the qualities of which you may know, ‘These qualities
  lead—

to passion, not to dispassion;

to being fettered, not to being unfettered;

to accumulating, not to shedding;

to self-aggrandizement, not to modesty;

to discontent, not to contentment;

to entanglement, not to seclusion;

to laziness, not to aroused persistence;

to being burdensome, not to being unburdensome’:

You may categorically hold, ‘This is not the Dhamma, this is
  not the Vinaya, this is not the Teacher’s instruction.’

“As for the qualities of which you may know, ‘These qualities
  lead—

to dispassion, not to passion;

to being unfettered, not to being fettered;

to shedding, not to accumulating;

to modesty, not to self-aggrandizement;

to contentment, not to discontent;

to seclusion, not to entanglement;

to aroused persistence, not to laziness;

to being unburdensome, not to being burdensome’:

You may categorically hold, ‘This is the Dhamma, this is the
  Vinaya, this is the Teacher’s instruction.’”

—[[AN8.53]]

“Upali, the qualities of which you may know, ‘These qualities
  do not lead to utter disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation,
  to calm, to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, nor to
  Unbinding’: You may categorically hold, ‘This is not the Dhamma,
  this is not the Vinaya, this is not the Teacher’s
  instruction.’

“As for the qualities of which you may know, ‘These qualities
  lead to utter disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to
  calm, to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, to Unbinding’: You
  may categorically hold, ‘This is the Dhamma, this is the Vinaya,
  this is the Teacher’s instruction.’”

—[[AN7.80]]

The test for the true Dhamma being pragmatic, this means
    that even when you are convinced that you have heard the true
    Dhamma, you must be careful to realize that simply hearing the
    truth is not enough to know it for sure.

 
The Buddha: “There are five things that can turn out in two
  ways in the here-&-now. Which five? Conviction, liking,
  unbroken tradition, reasoning by analogy, & an agreement through
  pondering views. These are the five things that can turn out in
  two ways in the here-&-now. Now some things are firmly held
  in conviction and yet vain, empty, & false. Some things are not
  firmly held in conviction, and yet they are genuine, factual, &
  unmistaken. Some things are well-liked… truly an unbroken
  tradition… well-reasoned… Some things are well-pondered and yet
  vain, empty, & false. Some things are not well-pondered, and yet
  they are genuine, factual, & unmistaken. In these cases it isn’t
  proper for a knowledgeable person who safeguards the truth to
  come to a definite conclusion, ‘Only this is true; anything else
  is worthless.”

Kapadika Bharadvaja: “But to what extent, Master Gotama, is
  there the safeguarding of the truth? To what extent does one
  safeguard the truth? We ask Master Gotama about the safeguarding
  of the truth.”

The Buddha: “If a person has conviction, his statement, ‘This
  is my conviction,’ safeguards the truth. But he doesn’t yet come
  to the definite conclusion that ‘Only this is true; anything else
  is worthless.’ To this extent, Bharadvaja, there is the
  safeguarding of the truth. To this extent one safeguards the
  truth. I describe this as the safeguarding of the truth. But it
  is not yet an awakening to the truth.”

—[[MN95]]

## Appropriate Attention ^sigil_toc_id_3

Having heard the Dhamma, it is important to bring
    appropriate attention—seeing things in terms of cause and
    effect—both to what you have heard and to your experiences in
    general, for this one factor can make all the difference in the
    success or failure of your practice.

 
“With regard to internal factors, I don’t envision any other
  single factor like appropriate attention as doing so much for a
  monk in training, who has not attained the goal but remains
  intent on the unsurpassed safety from bondage. A monk who attends
  appropriately abandons what is unskillful and develops what is
  skillful.

Appropriate attention

as a quality

of a monk in training:

nothing else

does so much

for attaining the superlative goal.

A monk, striving appropriately,

attains the ending of stress.

—[[ITI16]]

I have heard that on one occasion a certain monk was dwelling
  among the Kosalans in a forest thicket. Now at that time, he
  spent the day’s abiding thinking evil, unskillful thoughts: i.e.,
  thoughts of sensuality, thoughts of ill will, thoughts of
  harmfulness.

Then the devata inhabiting the forest thicket, feeling
  sympathy for the monk, desiring his benefit, desiring to bring
  him to his senses, approached him and addressed him with this
  verse:

“From inappropriate attention

you’re being chewed by your thoughts.

Relinquishing what’s inappropriate,

contemplate

appropriately.

Keeping your mind on the Teacher,

the Dhamma, the Sangha, your virtues,

you will arrive at

joy,

rapture,

pleasure

without doubt.

Then,      saturated

with joy,

you will put an end

to suffering & stress.”

The monk, chastened by the devata, came to his senses.

—[[SN9.11]]

Appropriate attention is essentially the ability to frame
    your understanding of experience in the right terms. In many
    cases, this means framing the right questions for gaining
    insight into suffering and its end.

 
“This is the way leading to discernment: when visiting a
  contemplative or brahman, to ask: ‘What is skillful, venerable
  sir? What is unskillful? What is blameworthy? What is blameless?
  What should be cultivated? What should not be cultivated? What,
  having been done by me, will be for my long-term harm &
  suffering? Or what, having been done by me, will be for my
  long-term welfare & happiness?’”

—[[MN135]]

“There is the case where an uninstructed, run-of-the-mill
  person…does not discern what ideas are fit for attention, or what
  ideas are unfit for attention. This being so, he does not attend
  to ideas fit for attention, and attends [instead] to ideas unfit
  for attention. And what are the ideas unfit for attention that he
  attends to? Whatever ideas such that, when he attends to them,
  the unarisen effluent of sensuality arises, and the arisen
  effluent of sensuality increases; the unarisen effluent of
  becoming… the unarisen effluent of ignorance arises, and the
  arisen effluent of ignorance increases…. This is how he attends
  inappropriately: ‘Was I in the past? Was I not in the past? What
  was I in the past? How was I in the past? Having been what, what
  was I in the past? Shall I be in the future? Shall I not be in
  the future? What shall I be in the future? How shall I be in the
  future? Having been what, what shall I be in the future?’ Or else
  he is inwardly perplexed about the immediate present: ‘Am I? Am I
  not? What am I? How am I? Where has this being come from? Where
  is it bound?’

“As he attends inappropriately in this way, one of six kinds
  of view arises in him: The view *I have a self* arises in
  him as true & established, or the view *I have no self…*
  or the view *It is precisely by means of self that I perceive
  self…* or the view *It is precisely by means of self that
  I perceive not-self…* or the view *It is precisely by
  means of not-self that I perceive self* arises in him as true
  & established, or else he has a view like this: *This very
  self of mine—the knower that is sensitive here & there to the
  ripening of good & bad actions—is the self of mine that is
  constant, everlasting, eternal, not subject to change, and will
  endure as long as eternity.* This is called a thicket of
  views, a wilderness of views, a contortion of views, a writhing
  of views, a fetter of views. Bound by a fetter of views, the
  uninstructed run-of-the-mill person is not freed from birth,
  aging, & death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &
  despair. He is not freed, I tell you, from stress.

“The well-instructed noble disciple… discerns what ideas are
  fit for attention, and what ideas are unfit for attention. This
  being so, he does not attend to ideas unfit for attention, and
  attends [instead] to ideas fit for attention…. And what are the
  ideas fit for attention that he attends to? Whatever ideas such
  that, when he attends to them, the unarisen effluent of
  sensuality does not arise, and the arisen effluent of sensuality
  is abandoned; the unarisen effluent of becoming… the unarisen
  effluent of ignorance does not arise, and the arisen effluent of
  ignorance is abandoned…. He attends appropriately, *This is
  stress… This is the origination of stress… This is the cessation
  of stress… This is the way leading to the cessation of
  stress.* As he attends appropriately in this way, three
  fetters are abandoned in him: identity-view, doubt, and grasping
  at habits & practices. These are called the effluents that are to
  be abandoned by seeing.”

—[[MN2]]

Appropriate attention can also mean framing the way you
    understand events as they occur.

 
Ven. MahaKotthita: “Sariputta my friend, which things should a
  virtuous monk attend to in an appropriate way?”

Ven. Sariputta: “A virtuous monk, Kotthita my friend,
  should attend in an appropriate way to the five
  clinging-aggregates as inconstant, stressful, a disease, a
  cancer, an arrow, painful, an affliction, alien, a dissolution,
  an emptiness, not-self. Which five? The form clinging-aggregate,
  the feeling… perception… fabrications… consciousness
  clinging-aggregate. A virtuous monk should attend in an
  appropriate way to these five clinging-aggregates as inconstant,
  stressful, a disease, a cancer, an arrow, painful, an affliction,
  alien, a dissolution, an emptiness, not-self. For it is possible
  that a virtuous monk, attending in an appropriate way to these
  five clinging-aggregates as inconstant… not-self, would realize
  the fruit of stream-entry.”

Ven. MahaKotthita: “Then which things should a monk who
  has attained stream-entry attend to in an appropriate way?”

Ven. Sariputta: “A monk who has attained stream-entry
  should attend in an appropriate way to these five
  clinging-aggregates as inconstant, stressful, a disease, a
  cancer, an arrow, painful, an affliction, alien, a dissolution,
  an emptiness, not-self. For it is possible that a monk who has
  attained stream-entry, attending in an appropriate way to these
  five clinging-aggregates as inconstant… not-self, would realize
  the fruit of once-returning.”

Ven. MahaKotthita: “Then which things should a monk who
  has attained once-returning attend to in an appropriate way?”

Ven. Sariputta: “A monk who has attained once-returning
  should attend in an appropriate way to these five
  clinging-aggregates as inconstant, stressful, a disease, a
  cancer, an arrow, painful, an affliction, alien, a dissolution,
  an emptiness, not-self. For it is possible that a monk who has
  attained once-returning, attending in an appropriate way to these
  five clinging-aggregates as inconstant… not-self, would realize
  the fruit of non-returning.”

Ven. MahaKotthita: “Then which things should a monk who
  has attained non-returning attend to in an appropriate way?”

Ven. Sariputta: “A monk who has attained non-returning
  should attend in an appropriate way to these five
  clinging-aggregates as inconstant, stressful, a disease, a
  cancer, an arrow, painful, an affliction, alien, a dissolution,
  an emptiness, not-self. For it is possible that a monk who has
  attained non-returning, attending in an appropriate way to these
  five clinging-aggregates as inconstant… not-self, would realize
  the fruit of arahantship.”

Ven. MahaKotthita: “Then which things should an arahant
  attend to in an appropriate way?”

Ven. Sariputta: “An arahant should attend in an
  appropriate way to these five clinging-aggregates as inconstant,
  stressful, a disease, a cancer, an arrow, painful, an affliction,
  alien, a dissolution, an emptiness, not-self. Although, for an
  arahant, there is nothing further to do, and nothing to add to
  what has been done, still these things—when developed &
  pursued—lead both to a pleasant abiding in the here-&-now and
  to mindfulness & alertness.”

—[[SN22.122]]

## Practice in Accordance with the Dhamma ^sigil_toc_id_4

In developing dispassion for the clinging-aggregates,
    appropriate attention is an important first step in practicing
    the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma.

 
“For a monk practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the
  Dhamma, this is what accords with the Dhamma: that he keep
  cultivating disenchantment with regard to form, that he keep
  cultivating disenchantment with regard to feeling, that he keep
  cultivating disenchantment with regard to perception, that he
  keep cultivating disenchantment with regard to fabrications, that
  he keep cultivating disenchantment with regard to consciousness.
  As he keeps cultivating disenchantment with regard to form…
  feeling… perception… fabrications… consciousness, he comprehends
  form… feeling… perception… fabrications… consciousness. As he
  comprehends form… feeling… perception… fabrications…
  consciousness, he is totally released from form… feeling…
  perception… fabrications… consciousness. He is totally released
  from sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses, & despairs. He is
  totally released, I tell you, from suffering & stress.”

“For a monk practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the
  Dhamma, this is what accords with the Dhamma: that he keep
  focused on inconstancy… stress… not-self with regard to form,
  that he keep focused on inconstancy… stress… not-self with regard
  to feeling… perception… fabrications… consciousness. As he keeps
  focusing on inconstancy… stress… not-self with regard to form…
  feeling… perception… fabrications… consciousness, he comprehends
  form… feeling… perception… fabrications… consciousness. As he
  comprehends form… feeling… perception… fabrications…
  consciousness, he is totally released from form… feeling…
  perception… fabrications… consciousness. He is totally released
  from sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses, & despairs. He is
  totally released, I tell you, from suffering & stress.”

—[[SN22.39]]-42

“If a monk teaches the Dhamma for the sake of disenchantment,
  dispassion, & cessation with regard to aging & death… birth…
  becoming… clinging/sustenance… craving… feeling… contact… the six
  sense media… name & form… consciousness… fabrications… ignorance,
  he deserves to be called a monk who is a speaker of Dhamma. If he
  practices for the sake of disenchantment, dispassion, & cessation
  with regard to aging & death… ignorance, he deserves to be called
  a monk who practices the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma.
  If—through disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, and lack of
  clinging/sustenance with regard to aging & death… ignorance—he is
  released, then he deserves to be called a monk who has attained
  Unbinding in the here-&-now.”

—[[SN12.67]]

The practice leading to disenchantment, dispassion, and
    release follows a stepwise path of cause and effect.

 
“Now, I tell you, clear knowing & release have their
  nutriment. They are not without nutriment. And what is their
  nutriment? The seven factors for awakening…. And what is the
  nutriment for the seven factors for awakening? The four
  establishings of mindfulness…. And what is the nutriment for the
  four establishings of mindfulness? The three forms of right
  conduct…. And what is the nutriment for the three forms of right
  conduct? Restraint of the senses…. And what is the nutriment for
  restraint of the senses? Mindfulness & alertness…. And what is
  the nutriment for mindfulness & alertness? Appropriate
  attention…. And what is the nutriment for appropriate attention?
  Conviction…. And what is the nutriment for conviction? Hearing
  the true Dhamma…. And what is the nutriment for hearing the true
  Dhamma? Associating with people who are truly good….

“Just as when the gods pour rain in heavy drops & crash
  thunder on the upper mountains: The water, flowing down along the
  slopes, fills the mountain clefts & rifts & gullies… the little
  ponds… the big lakes… the little rivers… the big rivers. When the
  big rivers are full, they fill the great ocean, and thus is the
  great ocean fed, thus is it filled. In the same way, when
  associating with truly good people is brought to fulfillment, it
  fulfills [the conditions for] hearing the true Dhamma…
  conviction… appropriate attention… mindfulness & alertness…
  restraint of the senses… the three forms of right conduct… the
  four establishings of mindfulness… the seven factors for
  awakening. When the seven factors for awakening are brought to
  fulfillment, they fulfill [the conditions for] clear knowing &
  release. Thus is clear knowing & release fed, thus is it brought
  to fulfillment.”

—[[AN10.61]]

### Mindfulness & Alertness ^sigil_toc_id_5

“Stay mindful, monks, and alert. This is our instruction to
  you all. And how is a monk mindful? There is the case where a
  monk remains focused on the body in & of itself—ardent, alert, &
  mindful—putting aside greed & distress with reference to the
  world. He remains focused on feelings… mind… mental qualities in
  & of themselves—ardent, alert, & mindful—putting aside greed &
  distress with reference to the world. This is how a monk is
  mindful.

“And how is a monk alert? There is the case where feelings are
  known to the monk as they arise, known as they persist, known as
  they subside. Thoughts are known to him as they arise, known as
  they persist, known as they subside. Discernment [*vl:*
  perception] is known to him as it arises, known as it persists,
  known as it subsides. This is how a monk is alert. So stay
  mindful, monks, and alert. This is our instruction to you
  all.”

—[[SN47.35]]

### Restraint of the Senses ^sigil_toc_id_6

“And how does a monk guard the doors of his senses? On seeing
  a form with the eye, he does not grasp at any theme or details by
  which—if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of
  the eye—evil, unskillful qualities such as greed or distress
  might assail him. On hearing a sound with the ear…. On smelling
  an odor with the nose…. One tasting a flavor with the tongue…. On
  touching a tactile sensation with the body…. On cognizing an idea
  with the intellect, he does not grasp at any theme or details by
  which—if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of
  the intellect—evil, unskillful qualities such as greed or
  distress might assail him. Endowed with this noble restraint over
  the sense faculties, he is inwardly sensitive to the pleasure of
  being blameless. This is how a monk guards the doors of his
  senses.”

—[[DN2]]

### The Three Forms of Right Conduct ^sigil_toc_id_7

“Now, Cunda, there are three ways in which one is made pure by
  bodily action, four ways in which one is made pure by verbal
  action, and three ways in which one is made pure by mental
  action.

“And how is one made pure in three ways by bodily action?
  There is the case where a certain person, abandoning the taking
  of life, abstains from the taking of life. He dwells with his rod
  laid down, his knife laid down, scrupulous, merciful,
  compassionate for the welfare of all living beings. Abandoning
  the taking of what is not given, he abstains from taking what is
  not given. He does not take, in the manner of a thief, things in
  a village or a wilderness that belong to others and have not been
  given by them. Abandoning sensual misconduct, he abstains from
  sensual misconduct. He does not get sexually involved with those
  who are protected by their mothers, their fathers, their
  brothers, their sisters, their relatives, or their Dhamma; those
  with husbands, those who entail punishments, or even those
  crowned with flowers by another man. This is how one is made pure
  in three ways by bodily action.

“And how is one made pure in four ways by verbal action? There
  is the case where a certain person, abandoning false speech,
  abstains from false speech. When he has been called to a town
  meeting, a group meeting, a gathering of his relatives, his
  guild, or of the royalty, if he is asked as a witness, ‘Come &
  tell, good man, what you know’: If he doesn’t know, he says, ‘I
  don’t know.’ If he does know, he says, ‘I know.’ If he hasn’t
  seen, he says, ‘I haven’t seen.’ If he has seen, he says, ’I have
  seen.’ Thus he doesn’t consciously tell a lie for his own sake,
  for the sake of another, or for the sake of any reward.
  Abandoning false speech, he abstains from false speech. He speaks
  the truth, holds to the truth, is firm, reliable, no deceiver of
  the world. Abandoning divisive speech, he abstains from divisive
  speech. What he has heard here he doesn’t tell there to break
  those people apart from these people here. What he has heard
  there he doesn’t tell here to break these people apart from those
  people there. Thus reconciling those who have broken apart or
  cementing those who are united, he loves concord, delights in
  concord, enjoys concord, speaks things that create concord.
  Abandoning abusive speech, he abstains from abusive speech. He
  speaks words that are soothing to the ear, that are affectionate,
  that go to the heart, that are polite, appealing & pleasing to
  people at large. Abandoning idle chatter, he abstains from idle
  chatter. He speaks in season, speaks what is factual, what is in
  accordance with the goal, the Dhamma, & the Vinaya. He speaks
  words worth treasuring, seasonable, reasonable, circumscribed,
  connected with the goal. This is how one is made pure in four
  ways by verbal action.

“And how is one made pure in three ways by mental action?
  There is the case where a certain person is not covetous. He does
  not covet the belongings of others, thinking, ‘O, that what
  belongs to others would be mine!’ He bears no ill will and is not
  corrupt in the resolves of his heart. [He thinks,] ‘May these
  beings be free from animosity, free from oppression, free from
  trouble, and may they look after themselves with ease!’ He has
  right view and is not warped in the way he sees things: ‘There is
  what is given, what is offered, what is sacrificed. There are
  fruits & results of good & bad actions. There is this world & the
  next world. There is mother & father. There are spontaneously
  reborn beings; there are contemplatives & brahmans who, faring
  rightly & practicing rightly, proclaim this world & the next
  after having directly known & realized it for themselves.’ This
  is how one is made pure in three ways by mental action.

“These, Cunda, are the ten courses of skillful action.”

—[[AN10.165]]

### The Four Establishings of Mindfulness ^sigil_toc_id_8

“[1] Now, on whatever occasion a monk breathing in long
  discerns that he is breathing in long; or breathing out long,
  discerns that he is breathing out long; or breathing in short,
  discerns that he is breathing in short; or breathing out short,
  discerns that he is breathing out short; trains himself to
  breathe in…&… out sensitive to the entire body; trains
  himself to breathe in…&…out calming bodily fabrication: On
  that occasion the monk remains focused on the *body* in &
  of itself—ardent, alert, & mindful—subduing greed & distress with
  reference to the world. I tell you, monks, that this—the
  in-&-out breath—is classed as a body among bodies, which is
  why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the body in & of
  itself—ardent, alert, & mindful—putting aside greed & distress
  with reference to the world.

“[2] On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe
  in…&…out sensitive to rapture; trains himself to breathe
  in…&…out sensitive to pleasure; trains himself to breathe
  in…&…out sensitive to mental fabrication; trains himself to
  breathe in…&…out calming mental fabrication: On that occasion
  the monk remains focused on *feelings* in & of
  themselves—ardent, alert, & mindful—subduing greed & distress
  with reference to the world. I tell you, monks, that this—close
  attention to in-&-out breaths—is classed as a feeling among
  feelings, which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused
  on feelings in & of themselves—ardent, alert, & mindful—putting
  aside greed & distress with reference to the world.

“[3] On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe
  in…&…out sensitive to the mind; trains himself to breathe
  in…&…out satisfying the mind; trains himself to breathe
  in…&…out steadying the mind; trains himself to breathe
  in…&…out releasing the mind: On that occasion the monk
  remains focused on the *mind* in & of itself—ardent,
  alert, & mindful—subduing greed & distress with reference to the
  world. I don’t say that there is mindfulness of in-&-out
  breathing in one of confused mindfulness and no alertness, which
  is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the mind in &
  of itself—ardent, alert, & mindful—putting aside greed & distress
  with reference to the world.

“[4] On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe
  in…&…out focusing on inconstancy; trains himself to breathe
  in…&…out focusing on dispassion; trains himself to breathe
  in…&…out focusing on cessation; trains himself to breathe
  in…&…out focusing on relinquishment: On that occasion the
  monk remains focused on *mental qualities* in & of
  themselves—ardent, alert, & mindful—subduing greed & distress
  with reference to the world. He who sees clearly with discernment
  the abandoning of greed & distress is one who oversees with
  equanimity, which is why the monk on that occasion remains
  focused on mental qualities in & of themselves—ardent, alert, &
  mindful—putting aside greed & distress with reference to the
  world.

“This is how mindfulness of in-&-out breathing is
  developed & pursued so as to bring the four establishings of
  mindfulness to their culmination.

### The Seven Factors for Awakening ^sigil_toc_id_9

“And how are the four establishings of mindfulness developed &
  pursued so as to bring the seven factors for awakening to their
  culmination?

“[1] On whatever occasion the monk remains focused on the
  *body* in & of itself—ardent, alert, & mindful—putting
  aside greed & distress with reference to the world, on that
  occasion his mindfulness is steady & without lapse. When his
  mindfulness is steady & without lapse, then *mindfulness*
  as a factor for awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and
  for him it goes to the culmination of its development.

“[2] Remaining mindful in this way, he examines, analyzes, &
  comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment. When
  he remains mindful in this way, examining, analyzing, & coming to
  a comprehension of that quality with discernment, then
  *analysis of qualities* as a factor for awakening becomes
  aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination
  of its development.

“[3] In one who examines, analyzes, & comes to a comprehension
  of that quality with discernment, unflagging persistence is
  aroused. When unflagging persistence is aroused in one who
  examines, analyzes, & comes to a comprehension of that quality
  with discernment, then *persistence* as a factor for
  awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to
  the culmination of its development.

“[4] In one whose persistence is aroused, a rapture
  not-of-the-flesh arises. When a rapture not-of-the-flesh arises
  in one whose persistence is aroused, then *rapture* as a
  factor for awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him
  it goes to the culmination of its development.

“[5] For one who is enraptured, the body grows calm and the
  mind grows calm. When the body & mind of an enraptured monk grow
  calm, then *calm* as a factor for awakening becomes
  aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination
  of its development.

“[6] For one who is at ease—his body calmed—the mind becomes
  concentrated. When the mind of one who is at ease—his body
  calmed—becomes concentrated, then *concentration* as a
  factor for awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him
  it goes to the culmination of its development.

“[7] He oversees the mind thus concentrated with equanimity.
  When he oversees the mind thus concentrated with equanimity,
  *equanimity* as a factor for awakening becomes aroused. He
  develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its
  development.

[Similarly with the other three establishings of mindfulness:
  feelings, mind, & mental qualities.]

“This is how the four establishings of mindfulness are
  developed & pursued so as to bring the seven factors for
  awakening to their culmination.

### Clear Knowing & Release ^sigil_toc_id_10

“And how are the seven factors for awakening developed &
  pursued so as to bring clear knowing & release to their
  culmination? There is the case where a monk develops
  *mindfulness* as a factor for awakening dependent on
  seclusion… dispassion… cessation, resulting in relinquishment. He
  develops *analysis of qualities* as a factor for
  awakening… *persistence* as a factor for awakening…
  *rapture* as a factor for awakening… *calm* as a
  factor for awakening… *concentration* as a factor for
  awakening… *equanimity* as a factor for awakening
  dependent on seclusion… dispassion… cessation, resulting in
  relinquishment.

“This is how the seven factors for awakening, when developed &
  pursued, bring clear knowing & release to their culmination.”

—[[MN118]]

The ability to follow this path to completion is not just a
    matter of mastering technique. It also depends on the ability
    to develop strong character traits.

 
“Now, what are the eight thoughts of a great person? This
  Dhamma is for one who is modest, not for one who is
  self-aggrandizing. This Dhamma is for one who is content, not for
  one who is discontent. This Dhamma is for one who is reclusive,
  not for one who is entangled. This Dhamma is for one whose
  persistence is aroused, not for one who is lazy. This Dhamma is
  for one whose mindfulness is established, not for one whose
  mindfulness is confused. This Dhamma is for one whose mind is
  concentrated, not for one whose mind is unconcentrated. This
  Dhamma is for one endowed with discernment, not for one whose
  discernment is weak. This Dhamma is for one who enjoys
  non-objectification, who delights in non-objectification, not for
  one who enjoys & delights in objectification.

“‘This Dhamma is for one who is modest, not for one who is
  self-aggrandizing.’ Thus was it said. With reference to what was
  it said? There is the case where a monk, being modest, does not
  want it to be known that ‘He is modest.’ Being content, he does
  not want it to be known that ‘He is content.’ Being reclusive, he
  does not want it to be known that ‘He is reclusive.’ His
  persistence being aroused, he does not want it to be known that
  ‘His persistence is aroused.’ His mindfulness being established,
  he does not want it to be known that ‘His mindfulness is
  established.’ His mind being concentrated, he does not want it to
  be known that ‘His mind is concentrated.’ Being endowed with
  discernment, he does not want it to be known that ‘He is endowed
  with discernment.’ Enjoying non-objectification, he does not want
  it to be known that ‘He is enjoying non-objectification.’ ‘This
  Dhamma is for one who is modest, not for one who is
  self-aggrandizing.’ Thus was it said. And with reference to this
  was it said.

“‘This Dhamma is for one who is content, not for one who is
  discontent.’ Thus was it said. With reference to what was it
  said? There is the case where a monk is content with any old robe
  cloth at all, any old almsfood, any old lodging, any old
  medicinal requisites for curing sickness at all. ‘This Dhamma is
  for one who is content, not for one who is discontent.’ Thus was
  it said. And with reference to this was it said.

“‘This Dhamma is for one who is reclusive, not for one who is
  entangled.’ Thus was it said. With reference to what was it said?
  There is the case where a monk, when living in seclusion, is
  visited by monks, nuns, lay men, lay women, kings, royal
  ministers, sectarians & their disciples. With his mind bent on
  seclusion, tending toward seclusion, inclined toward seclusion,
  aiming at seclusion, relishing renunciation, he converses with
  them only as much as necessary for them to take their leave.
  ‘This Dhamma is for one who is reclusive, not for one in
  entanglement.’ Thus was it said. And with reference to this was
  it said.

“‘This Dhamma is for one whose persistence is aroused, not for
  one who is lazy.’ Thus was it said. With reference to what was it
  said? There is the case where a monk keeps his persistence
  aroused for abandoning unskillful mental qualities and taking on
  skillful mental qualities. He is steadfast, solid in his effort,
  not shirking his duties with regard to skillful mental qualities.
  ‘This Dhamma is for one whose persistence is aroused, not for one
  who is lazy.’ Thus was it said. And with reference to this was it
  said.

“‘This Dhamma is for one whose mindfulness is established, not
  for one whose mindfulness is confused.’ Thus was it said. With
  reference to what was it said? There is the case where a monk is
  mindful, highly meticulous, remembering & able to call to mind
  even things that were done & said long ago. ‘This Dhamma is for
  one whose mindfulness is established, not for one whose
  mindfulness is confused.’ Thus was it said. And with reference to
  this was it said.

“‘This Dhamma is for one whose mind is concentrated, not for
  one whose mind is unconcentrated.’ Thus was it said. With
  reference to what was it said? There is the case where a
  monk—quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful
  qualities—enters & remains in the first jhana: rapture & pleasure
  born of seclusion, accompanied by directed thought & evaluation.
  With the stilling of directed thoughts & evaluations, he enters &
  remains in the second jhana: rapture & pleasure born of
  concentration, unification of awareness free from directed
  thought & evaluation—internal assurance. With the fading of
  rapture he remains equanimous, mindful, & alert, and senses
  pleasure with the body. He enters & remains in the third jhana,
  of which the Noble Ones declare, ‘Equanimous & mindful, he has a
  pleasant abiding.’ With the abandoning of pleasure & pain—as with
  the earlier disappearance of elation & distress—he enters &
  remains in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity & mindfulness,
  neither pleasure nor pain. ‘This Dhamma is for one whose mind is
  concentrated, not for one whose mind is unconcentrated.’ Thus was
  it said. And with reference to this was it said.

“‘This Dhamma is for one endowed with discernment, not for one
  whose discernment is weak.’ Thus was it said. With reference to
  what was it said? There is the case where a monk is discerning,
  endowed with discernment of arising & passing away—noble,
  penetrating, leading to the right ending of stress. ‘This Dhamma
  is for one endowed with discernment, not for one whose
  discernment is weak.’ Thus was it said. And with reference to
  this was it said.

“‘This Dhamma is for one who enjoys non-objectification, who
  delights in non-objectification, not for one who enjoys &
  delights in objectification.’ Thus was it said. With reference to
  what was it said? There is the case where a monk’s mind leaps up,
  grows confident, steadfast, & firm in the cessation of
  objectification. ‘This Dhamma is for one who enjoys
  non-objectification, who delights in non-objectification, not for
  one who enjoys & delights in objectification.’ Thus was it said.
  And with reference to this was it said.”

—[[AN8.30]]

“A monk endowed with these seven qualities is worthy of gifts,
  worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of respect, an
  unexcelled field of merit for the world. Which seven? There is
  the case where a monk is one with a sense of Dhamma, a sense of
  meaning, a sense of himself, a sense of moderation, a sense of
  time, a sense of social gatherings, & a sense of distinctions
  among individuals.

“And how is a monk one with a sense of Dhamma? There is the
  case where a monk knows the Dhamma: dialogues, narratives of
  mixed prose & verse, explanations, verses, spontaneous
  exclamations, quotations, birth stories, amazing events, question
  & answer sessions [this is a list of the earliest classifications
  of the Buddha’s teachings]. If he didn’t know the
  Dhamma—dialogues, narratives of mixed prose & verse,
  explanations, verses, spontaneous exclamations, quotations, birth
  stories, amazing events, question & answer sessions—he wouldn’t
  be said to be one with a sense of Dhamma. So it’s because he does
  know the Dhamma—dialogues… question & answer sessions—that he is
  said to be one with a sense of Dhamma. This is one with a sense
  of Dhamma.

“And how is a monk one with a sense of meaning? There is the
  case where a monk knows the meaning of this & that
  statement—‘This is the meaning of that statement; that is the
  meaning of this.’ If he didn’t know the meaning of this & that
  statement—‘This is the meaning of that statement; that is the
  meaning of this’—he wouldn’t be said to be one with a sense of
  meaning. So it’s because he does know the meaning of this & that
  statement—‘This is the meaning of that statement; that is the
  meaning of this’—that he is said to be one with a sense of
  meaning. This is one with a sense of Dhamma & a sense of
  meaning.

“And how is a monk one with a sense of himself? There is the
  case where a monk knows himself: ‘This is how far I have come in
  conviction, virtue, learning, generosity, discernment,
  quick-wittedness.’ If he didn’t know himself—‘This is how far I
  have come in conviction, virtue, learning, generosity,
  discernment, quick-wittedness’—he wouldn’t be said to be one with
  a sense of himself. So it’s because he does know himself—‘This is
  how far I have come in conviction, virtue, learning, generosity,
  discernment, quick-wittedness’—that he is said to be one with a
  sense of himself. This is one with a sense of Dhamma, a sense of
  meaning, & a sense of himself.

“And how is a monk one with a sense of moderation? There is
  the case where a monk knows moderation in accepting robes,
  almsfood, lodgings, & medicinal requisites for curing the sick.
  If he didn’t know moderation in accepting robes, almsfood,
  lodgings, & medicinal requisites for curing the sick, he wouldn’t
  be said to be one with a sense of moderation. So it’s because he
  does know moderation in accepting robes, almsfood, lodgings, &
  medicinal requisites for curing the sick, that he is said to be
  one with a sense of moderation. This is one with a sense of
  Dhamma, a sense of meaning, a sense of himself, & a sense of
  moderation.

“And how is a monk one with a sense of time? There is the case
  where a monk knows the time: ‘This is the time for recitation;
  this, the time for questioning; this, the time for making an
  effort [in meditation]; this, the time for seclusion.’ If he
  didn’t know the time—‘This is the time for recitation; this, the
  time for questioning; this, the time for making an effort; this,
  the time for seclusion’—he wouldn’t be said to be one with a
  sense of time. So it’s because he does know the time—‘This is the
  time for recitation; this, the time for questioning; this, the
  time for making an effort; this, the time for seclusion’—that he
  is said to be one with a sense of time. This is one with a sense
  of Dhamma, a sense of meaning, a sense of himself, a sense of
  moderation, & a sense of time.

“And how is a monk one with a sense of social gatherings?
  There is the case where a monk knows his social gathering: ‘This
  is a social gathering of noble warriors; this, a social gathering
  of brahmans; this, a social gathering of householders; this, a
  social gathering of contemplatives; here one should approach them
  in this way, stand in this way, act in this way, sit in this way,
  speak in this way, stay silent in this way.’ If he didn’t know
  his social gathering—‘This is a social gathering of noble
  warriors; this, a social gathering of brahmans; this, a social
  gathering of householders; this, a social gathering of
  contemplatives; here one should approach them in this way, stand
  in this way, act in this way, sit in this way, speak in this way,
  stay silent in this way’—he wouldn’t be said to be one with a
  sense of social gatherings. So it’s because he does know his
  social gathering—‘This is a social gathering of noble warriors;
  this, a social gathering of brahmans; this, a social gathering of
  householders; this, a social gathering of contemplatives; here
  one should approach them in this way, stand in this way, act in
  this way, sit in this way, speak in this way, stay silent in this
  way’—that he is said to be one with a sense of social gatherings.
  This is one with a sense of Dhamma, a sense of meaning, a sense
  of himself, a sense of moderation, a sense of time, & a sense of
  social gatherings.

“And how is a monk one with a sense of distinctions among
  individuals? There is the case where people are known to a monk
  in terms of two categories.

“Of two people—one who wants to see noble ones and one who
  doesn’t—the one who doesn’t want to see noble ones is to be
  criticized for that reason, the one who does want to see noble
  ones is, for that reason, to be praised.

“Of two people who want to see noble ones—one who wants to
  hear the true Dhamma and one who doesn’t—the one who doesn’t want
  to hear the true Dhamma is to be criticized for that reason, the
  one who does want to hear the true Dhamma is, for that reason, to
  be praised.

“Of two people who want to hear the true Dhamma—one who
  listens with an attentive ear and one who listens without an
  attentive ear—the one who listens without an attentive ear is to
  be criticized for that reason, the one who listens with an
  attentive ear is, for that reason, to be praised.

“Of two people who listen with an attentive ear—one who,
  having listened to the Dhamma, remembers it, and one who
  doesn’t—the one who, having listened to the Dhamma, doesn’t
  remember it is to be criticized for that reason, the one who,
  having listened to the Dhamma, does remember the Dhamma is, for
  that reason, to be praised.

“Of two people who, having listened to the Dhamma, remember
  it—one who explores the meaning of the Dhamma he has remembered
  and one who doesn’t—the one who doesn’t explore the meaning of
  the Dhamma he has remembered is to be criticized for that reason,
  the one who does explore the meaning of the Dhamma he has
  remembered is, for that reason, to be praised.

“Of two people who explore the meaning of the Dhamma they have
  remembered—one who practices the Dhamma in line with the Dhamma,
  having a sense of Dhamma, having a sense of meaning, and one who
  doesn’t—the one who doesn’t practice the Dhamma in line with the
  Dhamma, having a sense of Dhamma, having a sense of meaning, is
  to be criticized for that reason, the one who does practice the
  Dhamma in line with the Dhamma, having a sense of Dhamma, having
  a sense of meaning is, for that reason, to be praised.

“Of two people who practice the Dhamma in line with the
  Dhamma, having a sense of Dhamma, having a sense of meaning—one
  who practices for both his own benefit and that of others, and
  one who practices for his own benefit but not that of others—the
  one who practices for his own benefit but not that of others is
  to be criticized for that reason, the one who practices for both
  his own benefit and that of others is, for that reason, to be
  praised.

“This is how people are known to a monk in terms of two
  categories. And this is how a monk is one with a sense of
  distinctions among individuals.

“A monk endowed with these seven qualities is worthy of gifts,
  worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of respect, an
  unexcelled field of merit for the world.”

—[[AN7.64]]

To practice the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma not
    only makes one worthy of respect, it also is a way of showing
    respect and gratitude to the Buddha for his admirable
    friendship in creating the opportunity for hearing the true
    Dhamma.

 
Then the Blessed One [on his death-bed] said to Ven. Ananda,
  “Ananda, the twin sal-trees are in full bloom, even though it’s
  not the flowering season. They shower, strew, & sprinkle on the
  Tathagata’s body in homage to him. Heavenly coral-tree blossoms
  are falling from the sky…. Heavenly sandalwood powder is falling
  from the sky…. Heavenly music is playing in the sky…. Heavenly
  songs are sung in the sky, in homage to the Tathagata. But it is
  not to this extent that a Tathagata is worshipped, honored,
  respected, venerated, or paid homage to. Rather, the monk, nun,
  male lay follower, or female lay follower who keeps practicing
  the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma, who keeps practicing
  masterfully, who lives in accordance with the Dhamma: that is the
  person who worships, honors, respects, venerates, & pays homage
  to the Tathagata with the highest homage. So you should train
  yourselves: ‘We will keep practicing the Dhamma in accordance
  with the Dhamma, we will keep practicing masterfully, we will
  live in accordance with the Dhamma.’ That’s how you should train
  yourselves.”

Part Two
  

# Stream Entry & its Results

When treating the experience of stream entry and its
    results, the Canon uses all three of its typical modes of
    discourse: the narrative mode—stories about people who have
    attained stream entry; the cosmological mode—descriptions of
    the after-death destinations awaiting those who have attained
    stream entry; and what might be called the “emptiness” mode,
    which describes mental states in and of themselves as they are
    directly experienced as absent or present, both during and
    after stream entry.

The material in this part of the study guide is presented in
    five sections. The first section, **The Arising of the
    Dhamma Eye,** discusses the experience of stream entry,
    and concludes with a passage indicating why the experience is
    described in terms of the faculty of vision. The second
    section, **The Three Fetters,** discusses the
    three fetters of renewed existence that are cut with the
    arising of the Dhamma eye: self-identity views, uncertainty,
    and grasping at habits and practices. The third section,
    **The Character of the Stream-enterer,** discusses
    the personal characteristics of a stream-enterer that flow
    directly from the cutting of the first three fetters. This
    section focuses on three lists of the four factors of stream
    entry, which are not to be confused with the four factors for
    stream entry discussed in the first part of this study guide.
    The fourth section, **Rewards,** discusses the
    rewards of stream entry that are come both in this life and in
    future lives. The final section, **Advice,**
    echoes the Buddha’s last words to his disciples before entering
    total nibbana. The discourse reporting those words—[[DN16]]—also
    reports that the most backward of the monks present at the
    Buddha’s passing away were stream-enterers. The fact that his
    last words to them stressed the need for heedfulness underlies
    the fact that even stream-enterers have to be wary of
    heedlessness. This is especially true in the present day, when
    many different meditation schools define the attainment of
    stream entry in such different terms, raising the question of
    whose certification of stream entry is valid and whose is not.
    The safest course of action for all meditators—whether
    certified as stream-enterers or not, and whether that
    certification is valid or not—is to maintain an attitude of
    heedfulness with regard to all mental qualities.

*   *   *

*The term “stream” in “stream entry” refers to the point
    where all eight factors of the noble eightfold path come
    together.*

“Sariputta, ‘The stream, the stream’: thus it is said. And
  what, Sariputta, is the stream?”

“This noble eightfold path, lord, is the stream: right view,
  right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood,
  right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.”

“Very good, Sariputta! Very good! This noble eightfold
  path—right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right
  livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right
  concentration—is the stream.”

—[[SN55.5]]

“And what is right view? Knowledge in terms of stress,
  knowledge in terms of the origination of stress, knowledge in
  terms of the cessation of stress, knowledge in terms of the way
  of practice leading to the cessation of stress: This is called
  right view.

“And what is right resolve? Being resolved on renunciation, on
  non-ill will, on harmlessness: This is called right resolve.

“And what is right speech? Abstaining from lying, from
  divisive speech, from abusive speech, & from idle chatter: This
  is called right speech.

“And what is right action? Abstaining from taking life, from
  stealing, & from sexual intercourse: This is called right
  action.

“And what is right livelihood? There is the case where a
  disciple of the noble ones, having abandoned dishonest
  livelihood, keeps his life going with right livelihood. This is
  called right livelihood.

“And what is right effort? There is the case where a monk
  generates desire, endeavors, arouses persistence, upholds &
  exerts his intent for the sake of the non-arising of evil,
  unskillful qualities that have not yet arisen… for the sake of
  the abandoning of evil, unskillful qualities that have arisen…
  for the sake of the arising of skillful qualities that have not
  yet arisen… (and) for the maintenance, non-confusion, increase,
  plenitude, development, & culmination of skillful qualities that
  have arisen. This is called right effort.

“And what is right mindfulness? There is the case where a monk
  remains focused on the body in & of itself—ardent, alert, &
  mindful—putting aside greed & distress with reference to the
  world. He remains focused on feelings in & of themselves… the
  mind in & of itself… mental qualities in & of themselves—ardent,
  alert, & mindful—putting aside greed & distress with reference to
  the world. This is called right mindfulness.

“And what is right concentration? There is the case where a
  monk—quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful
  qualities—enters & remains in the first jhana: rapture & pleasure
  born of seclusion, accompanied by directed thought & evaluation.
  With the stilling of directed thoughts & evaluations, he enters &
  remains in the second jhana: rapture & pleasure born of
  concentration, unification of awareness free from directed
  thought & evaluation—internal assurance. With the fading of
  rapture he remains equanimous, mindful, & alert, and senses
  pleasure with the body. He enters & remains in the third jhana,
  of which the Noble Ones declare, ‘Equanimous & mindful, he has a
  pleasant abiding.’ With the abandoning of pleasure & pain—as with
  the earlier disappearance of elation & distress—he enters &
  remains in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity & mindfulness,
  neither pleasure nor pain. This is called right
  concentration.”

—[[SN45.8]]

The coming-together of these factors is called the stream
    because it leads inevitably to two things, just as the current
    of a tributary will lead inevitably to a major river and then
    to the sea. In the immediate present, the stream leads directly
    to the arising of the Dhamma eye, the vision that actually
    constitutes this first awakening. Over time, the stream ensures
    that—in no more than seven lifetimes—one will be totally
    unbound.

 

## The Arising of the Dhamma Eye ^sigil_toc_id_11

What does the Dhamma eye see when it arises?

 
Then Ven. Assaji gave this Dhamma exposition to Sariputta the
  wanderer:

“Whatever phenomena arise from a cause:

Their cause

& their cessation.

Such is the teaching of the Tathagata,

the Great Contemplative.”

Then to Sariputta the wanderer, as he heard this exposition of
  Dhamma, there arose the dustless, stainless Dhamma eye:
  *Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to
  cessation.*

—Mv I.23.5

This standard formula—it is repeated throughout the
    Canon—may not seem that remarkable an insight. However, the
    texts make clear that this insight is not a matter of belief or
    contemplation, but of direct seeing. As the following passages
    show, belief and contemplation may be conducive to the
    seeing—and an undefined level of belief and discernment may
    actually guarantee that someday in this lifetime the seeing
    will occur—but only with the actual seeing does there come a
    dramatic shift in the course of one’s life and one’s
    relationship to the Dhamma.

 
“Monks, the eye is inconstant, changeable, alterable. The ear…
  The nose… The tongue… The body… The mind is inconstant,
  changeable, alterable.

Forms…. Sounds .… Aromas…. Flavors…. Tactile sensations….
  Ideas are inconstant, changeable, alterable.

“Eye-consciousness…. Ear-consciousness…. Nose-consciousness….

“One who has conviction & belief that these phenomena are this
  way is called a faith-follower: one who has entered the
  orderliness of rightness, entered the plane of people of
  integrity, transcended the plane of the run-of-the-mill. He is
  incapable of doing any deed by which he might be reborn in hell,
  in the animal womb, or in the realm of hungry ghosts. He is
  incapable of passing away until he has realized the fruit of
  stream entry.

“One who, after pondering with a modicum of discernment, has
  accepted that these phenomena are this way is called a
  Dhamma-follower: one who has entered the orderliness of
  rightness, entered the plane of people of integrity, transcended
  the plane of the run-of-the-mill. He is incapable of doing any
  deed by which he might be reborn in hell, in the animal womb, or
  in the realm of hungry ghosts. He is incapable of passing away
  until he has realized the fruit of stream entry.

“One who knows and sees that these phenomena are this way is
  called a stream-enterer, steadfast, never again destined for
  states of woe, headed for self-awakening.”

—[[SN25.1]]-10

To Upali the householder, as he was sitting right there, there
  arose the dustless, stainless Dhamma eye: *Whatever is subject
  to origination is all subject to cessation.* Then—having seen
  the Dhamma, having reached the Dhamma, known the Dhamma, gained a
  footing in the Dhamma, having crossed over & beyond doubt, having
  had no more questioning—Upali the householder gained fearlessness
  and was independent of others with regard to the Teacher’s
  message.

—[[MN56]]

Part of what makes the arising of the Dhamma eye such a
    powerful experience is that the realization that “Whatever is
    subject to origination is all subject to cessation” must follow
    on a glimpse of what stands in opposition to “all that is
    subject to origination,” i.e., a glimpse of the
    Unconditioned—deathlessness.

 
[Immediately after attaining the stream] Sariputta the
  wanderer went to Moggallana the wanderer. Moggallana the wanderer
  saw him coming from afar and, on seeing him, said, “Your
  faculties are bright, my friend; your complexion pure & clear.
  Could it be that you have attained the Deathless?”

“Yes, my friend, I have….”

—Mv I.23.5

The connection between Ven. Assaji’s verse above, discussing
    causation, and the arising of the Dhamma eye in Sariputta
    suggests that realization conveyed by the Dhamma eye is not
    just an insight into the fleeting, impermanent nature of
    ordinary experience. Instead, it extends also to a realization
    of the conditioned, dependent nature of that experience. Other
    passages describing in more detail the knowledge of a
    stream-enterer—one who has entered the stream—show that this is
    in fact the case. The Dhamma eye sees that things arise and
    pass away in line with a particular type of causality, in which
    the effects of causes are felt immediately or over the course
    of time.

 
“And which is the noble method that he has rightly seen &
  rightly ferreted out through discernment?

“There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones
  notices:

“When this is, that is.

“From the arising of this comes the arising of that.

“When this isn’t, that isn’t.

“From the cessation of this comes the cessation of that.

“In other words:

“From ignorance as a requisite condition come
  fabrications.

“From fabrications as a requisite condition comes
  consciousness.

“From consciousness as a requisite condition comes
  name-&-form.

“From name-&-form as a requisite condition come the six
  sense media.

“From the six sense media as a requisite condition comes
  contact.

“From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling.

“From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving.

“From craving as a requisite condition comes
  clinging/sustenance.

“From clinging/sustenance as a requisite condition comes
  becoming.

“From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth.

“From birth as a requisite condition, then aging & death,
  sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, & despair come into play.
  Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress &
  suffering.

“Now from the remainderless fading & cessation of that very
  ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications. From the cessation
  of fabrications comes the cessation of consciousness. From the
  cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of
  name-&-form. From the cessation of name-&-form comes the
  cessation of the six sense media. From the cessation of the six
  sense media comes the cessation of contact. From the cessation of
  contact comes the cessation of feeling. From the cessation of
  feeling comes the cessation of craving. From the cessation of
  craving comes the cessation of clinging/sustenance. From the
  cessation of clinging/sustenance comes the cessation of becoming.
  From the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth. From
  the cessation of birth, then aging & death, sorrow, lamentation,
  pain, distress, & despair all cease. Such is the cessation of
  this entire mass of stress & suffering.

“This is the noble method that he has rightly seen & rightly
  ferreted out through discernment.”

—[[AN10.92]]

“When a disciple of the noble ones has seen well with right
  discernment this dependent co-arising & these dependently
  co-arisen phenomena as they are actually present, it is not
  possible that he would run after the past, thinking, ‘Was I in
  the past? Was I not in the past? What was I in the past? How was
  I in the past? Having been what, what was I in the past?’ or that
  he would run after the future, thinking, ‘Shall I be in the
  future? Shall I not be in the future? What shall I be in the
  future? How shall I be in the future? Having been what, what
  shall I be in the future?’ or that he would be inwardly perplexed
  about the immediate present, thinking, ‘Am I? Am I not? What am
  I? How am I? Where has this being come from? Where is it bound?’
  Such a thing is not possible. Why is that? Because the disciple
  of the noble ones has seen well with right discernment this
  dependent co-arising & these dependently co-arisen phenomena as
  they are actually present.”

—[[SN12.20]]

The insight of a stream-enterer into the truths of causality
    on the one hand, and of the Deathless on the other, is accurate
    as far as it goes, but it does not equal the intensity of the
    insight of the arahant—one who has reached the final level of
    awakening. The differences between the two are suggested in the
    following simile.

 
[Ven. Narada:] “My friend, although I have seen properly with
  right discernment, as it actually is present, that ‘The cessation
  of becoming is Unbinding,’ still I am not an arahant whose
  effluents are ended. It’s as if there were a well along a road in
  a desert, with neither rope nor water bucket. A man would come
  along overcome by heat, oppressed by the heat, exhausted,
  dehydrated, & thirsty. He would look into the well and would have
  knowledge of ‘water,’ but he would not dwell touching it with his
  body. In the same way, although I have seen properly with right
  discernment, as it actually is present, that ‘The cessation of
  becoming is Unbinding,’ still I am not an arahant whose effluents
  are ended.”

—[[SN12.68]]

## The Three Fetters ^sigil_toc_id_12

The four levels of Awakening are defined by the extent to
    which they cut the ten fetters by which the mind binds itself
    to conditioned experience.

 
“And which are the five lower fetters? Self-identity views,
  uncertainty, grasping at habits & practices, sensual desire, &
  ill will. These are the five lower fetters. And which are the
  five higher fetters? Passion for form, passion for what is
  formless, conceit, restlessness, & ignorance. These are the five
  higher fetters.”

—[[AN10.13]]

“In this community of monks there are monks who are arahants,
  whose effluents are ended, who have reached fulfillment, done the
  task, laid down the burden, attained the true goal, totally
  destroyed the fetter of becoming, and who are released through
  right gnosis….

“In this community of monks there are monks who, with the
  total ending of the five lower fetters, are due to be reappear
  [in the Pure Abodes], there to be totally unbound, never again to
  return from that world….

“In this community of monks there are monks who, with the
  total ending of [the first] three fetters, and with the
  attenuation of passion, aversion, & delusion, are once-returners,
  who—on returning only one more time to this world—will make an
  ending to stress….

“In this community of monks there are monks who, with the
  total ending of [the first] three fetters, are stream-winners,
  steadfast, never again destined for states of woe, headed for
  self-awakening.”

—[[MN118]]

For the stream-enterer, the arising of the Dhamma eye—with
    its insight into the causal principles underlying the
    origination and cessation of stress—is what cuts through the
    first three fetters.

 
“He attends appropriately, *This is stress… This is the
  origination of stress… This is the cessation of stress… This is
  the way leading to the cessation of stress.* As he attends
  appropriately in this way, three fetters are abandoned in him:
  self-identity view, doubt, and grasping at habits &
  practices.”

—[[MN2]]

The Canon contains passages that amplify what it means to
    cut the first three of these fetters. First,
    **self-identity views:**

 
[Visakha:] “But, lady, how does self-identity come about?”

[Sister Dhammadinna:] “There is the case, friend Visakha,
  where an uninstructed, run-of-the-mill person—who has no regard
  for noble ones, is not well-versed or disciplined in their
  Dhamma; who has no regard for men of integrity, is not
  well-versed or disciplined in their Dhamma—assumes form (the
  body) to be the self, or the self as possessing form, or form as
  in the self, or the self as in form.

“He assumes feeling to be the self….

“He assumes perception to be the self….

“He assumes fabrications to be the self….

“He assumes consciousness to be the self, or the self as
  possessing consciousness, or consciousness as in the self, or the
  self as in consciousness. This is how self-identity comes
  about.”

[Visakha:] “But, lady, how does self-identity not come
  about?”

[Sister Dhammadinna:] “There is the case where a
  well-instructed disciple of the noble ones—who has regard for
  noble ones, is well-versed & disciplined in their Dhamma; who has
  regard for men of integrity, is well-versed & disciplined in
  their Dhamma—does not assume form to be the self, or the self as
  possessing form, or form as in the self, or the self as in
  form.

“He does not assume feeling to be the self….

“He does not assume perception to be the self….

“He does not assume fabrications to be the self….

“He does not assume consciousness to be the self, or the self
  as possessing consciousness, or consciousness as in the self, or
  the self as in consciousness. This is how self-identity does not
  come about.”

—[[MN44]]

[Visakha:] “‘The origination of self-identity, the origination
  of self-identity,’ it is said, lady. Which origination of
  self-identity is described by the Blessed One?”

[Sister Dhammadinna:] “The craving that makes for further
  becoming—accompanied by passion & delight, relishing now here &
  now there—i.e., craving for sensual pleasure, craving for
  becoming, craving for non-becoming: This, friend Visakha, is the
  origination of self-identity described by the Blessed One.”

[Visakha:] “‘The cessation of self-identity, the cessation of
  self-identity,’ it is said, lady. Which cessation of
  self-identity is described by the Blessed One?”

[Sister Dhammadinna:] “The remainderless fading & cessation,
  renunciation, relinquishment, release, & letting go of that very
  craving: This, friend Visakha, is the cessation of self-identity
  described by the Blessed One.”

[Visakha:] “‘The way of practice leading to the cessation of
  self-identity, the way of practice leading to the cessation of
  self-identity,’ it is said, lady. Which way of practice leading
  to the cessation of self-identity is described by the Blessed
  One?”

[Sister Dhammadinna:] “Precisely this noble eightfold
  path—right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right
  livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration:
  This, friend Visakha, is the way of practice leading to the
  cessation of self-identity described by the Blessed One.”

—[[MN44]]

[Ven. Ananda:] “What is the noble liberation?”

[The Buddha:] “There is the case, Ananda, where a disciple of
  the noble ones considers this: ‘Sensuality here & now; sensuality
  in lives to come; sensual perceptions here & now; sensual
  perceptions in lives to come; forms here & now; forms in lives to
  come; form-perceptions here & now; form-perceptions in lives to
  come; perceptions of the imperturbable; perceptions of the
  dimension of nothingness; perceptions of the dimension of neither
  perception nor non-perception: that is an identity, to the extent
  that there is an identity. This is deathless: the liberation of
  the mind through lack of clinging/sustenance.’”

—[[MN106]]

“Magandiya, it is just as if there were a blind man who
  couldn’t see black objects… white… blue… yellow… red… the sun or
  the moon. Now suppose that a certain man were to take a grimy,
  oil-stained rag and fool him, saying, ‘Here, my good man, is a
  white cloth—beautiful, spotless, & clean.’ The blind man would
  take it and wear it.

“Then suppose his friends, companions, & relatives took him to
  a doctor, and the doctor treated him with medicine: purges from
  above & purges from below, ointments & counter-ointments, and
  treatments through the nose. And thanks to the medicine his
  eyesight would appear & grow clear. Then together with the
  arising of his eyesight, he would abandon whatever passion &
  delight he felt for that grimy, oil-stained rag. And he would
  regard that man as an enemy & no friend at all, and think that he
  deserved to be killed. ‘My gosh, how long have I been fooled,
  cheated, & deceived by that man & his grimy, oil-stained
  rag!—“Here, my good man, is a white cloth—beautiful, spotless, &
  clean.”’

“In the same way, Magandiya, if I were to teach you the
  Dhamma—this freedom from Disease, this Unbinding—and you on your
  part were to understand that freedom from Disease and see that
  Unbinding, then together with the arising of your eyesight, you
  would abandon whatever passion & delight you felt with regard for
  the five aggregates for sustenance. And it would occur to you,
  ‘My gosh, how long have I been fooled, cheated, & deceived by
  this mind! For in clinging, it was just form that I was clinging
  to…it was just feeling… just perception… just fabrications… just
  consciousness that I was clinging to. With my clinging as
  condition, there is becoming… birth… aging & death… sorrow,
  lamentation, pains, distresses, & despairs all come into play.
  And thus is the origination of this entire mass of stress.’”

—[[MN75]]

In the following passage, Ven. Khemaka—a monk who has
    attained the level of non-returner, and so has cut the first
    five fetters—indicates how self-identity views may be cut even
    though the mind has yet to cut the conceit, “I am,” which ends
    only at the level of full awakening.

 
[Ven. Khemaka:] “Friends, it’s not that I say ‘I am form,’ nor
  do I say ‘I am something other than form.’ It’s not that I say,
  ‘I am feeling… perception… fabrications… consciousness,’ nor do I
  say, ‘I am something other than consciousness.’ With regard to
  these five clinging-aggregates, ‘I am’ has not been overcome,
  although I don’t assume that ‘I am this.’

“It’s just like the scent of a blue, red, or white lotus: If
  someone were to call it the scent of a petal or the scent of the
  color or the scent of a filament, would he be speaking
  correctly?”

“No, friend.”

“Then how would he describe it if he were describing it
  correctly?”

“As the scent of the flower: That’s how he would describe it
  if he were describing it correctly.”

“In the same way, friends, it’s not that I say ‘I am form,’
  nor do I say ‘I am other than form.’ It’s not that I say, ‘I am
  feeling… perception… fabrications… consciousness,’ nor do I say,
  ‘I am something other than consciousness.’ With regard to these
  five clinging-aggregates, ‘I am’ has not been overcome, although
  I don’t assume that ‘I am this.’”

—[[SN22.89]]

**The fetter of uncertainty** is defined as
    doubt in the Awakening of the Buddha, the truth of his Dhamma,
    and the practice of his noble disciples. What this uncertainty
    boils down to is doubt as to whether there is a Deathless
    dimension, and whether one can realize it through one’s own
    efforts. The experience of the Deathless—following on the
    practice of the Dhamma to the point of entering the stream—cuts
    this fetter by confirming the possibility of a human being’s
    awakening to the Deathless, the correctness of the Buddha’s
    teaching as a guide to entering the stream, and the worthiness
    of those who have reached the stream.

 
“There is the case where the disciple of the noble ones is
  endowed with verified confidence in the Awakened One: ‘Indeed,
  the Blessed One is worthy and rightly self-awakened, consummate
  in knowledge & conduct, well-gone, an expert with regard to the
  world, unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed,
  the Teacher of devas & human beings, awakened, blessed.’

“He is endowed with verified confidence in the Dhamma: ‘The
  Dhamma is well-expounded by the Blessed One, to be seen here &
  now, timeless, inviting verification, pertinent, to be realized
  by the wise for themselves.’

“He is endowed with verified confidence in the Sangha: ‘The
  Sangha of the Blessed One’s disciples who have practiced well…
  who have practiced straight-forwardly… who have practiced
  methodically… who have practiced masterfully—in other words, the
  four types of noble disciples when taken as pairs, the eight when
  taken as individual types[[#^AN10.92note01|1]]—they are the
  Sangha of the Blessed One’s disciples: worthy of gifts, worthy of
  hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of respect, the
  incomparable field of merit for the world.’”

Note

 
1. The four pairs are (1) the person on
    the path to stream entry, the person experiencing the fruit of
    stream entry; (2) the person on the path to once-returning, the
    person experiencing the fruit of once-returning; (3) the person
    on the path to non-returning, the person experiencing the fruit
    of non-returning; (4) the person on the path to arahantship,
    the person experiencing the fruit of arahantship. The eight
    individuals are the eight types forming these four pairs. ^[[AN10.92]]note01

 
—[[AN10.92]]

**The fetter of grasping at habits and
    practices** is often described in the Pali Canon with
    reference to the view that one becomes pure simply through
    performing rituals or patterns of behavior. This view in turn
    is related to the notion that one’s being is defined by one’s
    actions: If one acts in accordance with clearly defined habits
    and practices, one is ipso facto pure. Although the Canon
    recognizes the importance of habits and practices in the
    attaining the stream, the experience of the Deathless shows the
    person who has attained the stream that one cannot define
    oneself in terms of those habits and practices. Thus one
    continues to follow virtuous practices, but without defining
    oneself in terms of them.

 
“Now where do skillful habits cease without trace? Their
  cessation, too, has been stated: There is the case where a monk
  is virtuous, but not fashioned of (or: defined by his) virtue. He
  discerns, as it actually is, the awareness-release &
  discernment-release where his skillful habits cease without
  trace.”

—[[MN78]]

[The enlightened person] doesn’t speak of purity

in terms of      view,

learning,

knowledge,

habit or practice.

Nor is it found by a person

through lack of view,

of learning,

of knowledge,

of habit or practice.

Letting these go, without grasping,

one is independent,

at peace.

—[[SN35.16]]

## The Character of a Stream-winner ^sigil_toc_id_13

A standard formula in the Canon describes a stream-enterer
    in terms of four factors. The first three of these four factors
    of stream entry are directly related to the cutting of the
    fetter of uncertainty. The fourth is related to the cutting of
    the fetter of grasping at habits and practices.

 
“There is the case where the disciple of the noble ones is
  endowed with verified confidence in the Awakened One… verified
  confidence in the Dhamma… verified confidence in the Sangha….
  He/she is endowed with virtues that are appealing to the noble
  ones: untorn, unbroken, unspotted, unsplattered, liberating,
  praised by the wise, untarnished, leading to concentration.”

—[[AN10.92]]

Although this is the standard list of the four factors of
    stream entry, there are other lists that replace the fourth
    factor with other factors.

[[SN55.32]] defines the fourth factor as follows: “Furthermore,
    the disciple of the noble ones lives at home with an awareness
    cleansed of the stain of stinginess, freely generous,
    openhanded, delighting in being magnanimous, responsive to
    requests, delighting in the distribution of alms.

[[SN55.33]] defines it as follows: “Furthermore, the disciple
    of the noble ones is discerning, endowed with discernment of
    arising & passing away—noble, penetrating, leading to the right
    ending of stress.”

When these lists are collated, we arrive at four qualities
    that describe a stream-enterer: conviction, virtue, generosity,
    and discernment. [[AN8.54]] describes these as “four qualities
    that lead to a lay person’s happiness and well-being in lives
    to come.” Other passages in the Canon explore the implications
    of each of these four as embodied in a stream-enterer’s
    behavior.

**Conviction** in the Triple Gem of the Buddha,
    Dhamma, and Sangha is not simply a matter of belief or
    devotion. It forces one to place trust in the principle of
    kamma—the principle of action and result in line with which one
    first gained entry to the stream.

“Endowed with these five qualities, a lay follower is a jewel
  of a lay follower, a lotus of a lay follower, a fine flower of a
  lay follower. Which five? He/she has conviction; is virtuous; is
  not eager for protective charms & ceremonies; trusts kamma, not
  protective charms & ceremonies; does not search for recipients of
  his/her offerings outside [of the Sangha], and gives offerings
  here first.”

—[[AN5.175]]

**Virtue,** as practiced by the stream-enterer,
    is also a function of a deep trust in the principle of kamma,
    and of a sympathy for others that arises from that trust.
    Although stream-enterers may still break the minor rules of
    training, the depth of insight that informs their virtue
    ensures that their adherence to the basic principles of
    morality is unshakable.

 
“There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones reflects
  thus: ‘I love life and don’t love death. I love happiness and
  abhor pain. Now if I—loving life and not loving death, loving
  happiness and abhorring pain—were to be killed, that would be
  displeasing & disagreeable to me. And if I were to kill another
  who loves life and doesn’t love death, who loves happiness and
  abhors pain, that would be displeasing & disagreeable to the
  other. What is displeasing & disagreeable to me is displeasing &
  disagreeable to others. How can I inflict on others what is
  displeasing & disagreeable to me?’ Reflecting in this way, he
  refrains from taking life, gets others to refrain from taking
  life, and speaks in praise of refraining from taking life. In
  this way his bodily behavior is pure in three ways.

“Furthermore, he reflects thus: ‘If someone, by way of theft,
  were to take from me what I haven’t given, that would be
  displeasing & disagreeable to me…. If someone were to commit
  adultery with my wives, that would be displeasing & disagreeable
  to me…. If someone were to damage my well-being with a lie, that
  would be displeasing & disagreeable to me…. If someone were to
  divide me from my friends with divisive speech, that would be
  displeasing & disagreeable to me…. If someone were to address me
  with harsh speech, that would be displeasing & disagreeable to
  me…. If someone were to address me with idle chatter, that would
  be displeasing & disagreeable to me. And if I were to address
  another with idle chatter, that would be displeasing &
  disagreeable to the other. What is displeasing & disagreeable to
  me is displeasing & disagreeable to others. How can I inflict on
  others what is displeasing & disagreeable to me?’ Reflecting in
  this way, he refrains from idle chatter, gets others to refrain
  from idle chatter, and speaks in praise of refraining from idle
  chatter. In this way his verbal behavior is pure in three
  ways.”

—[[SN55.7]]

“Monks, this recitation of more than 150 training rules comes
  every fortnight, in reference to which sons of good families
  desiring the goal train themselves. There are these three
  trainings under which all that is gathered. Which three? The
  training in heightened virtue, the training in heightened mind,
  the training in heightened discernment. These are the three
  trainings under which all that is gathered.

“There is the case where a monk is wholly accomplished in
  virtue, moderately accomplished in concentration, and moderately
  accomplished in discernment. With reference to the lesser and
  minor training rules, he falls into offenses and rehabilitates
  himself. Why is that? Because I have not declared that to be a
  disqualification in these circumstances. But as for the training
  rules that are basic to the holy life and proper to the holy
  life, he is one of permanent virtue, one of steadfast virtue.
  Having undertaken them, he trains in reference to the training
  rules. With the wasting away of [the first] three fetters, he is
  a stream-winner, never again destined for states of woe, certain,
  headed for self-awakening.”

—[[AN3.87]]

**Generosity** is actually a characteristic
    that must precede stream entry. However, the attainment of
    stream entry gives generosity a distinctive integrity.

 
“Monks, there are these five forms of stinginess. Which five?
  Stinginess as to one’s monastery [lodgings], stinginess as to
  one’s family [of supporters], stinginess as to one’s gains,
  stinginess as to one’s status, and stinginess as to the Dhamma.
  These are the five forms of stinginess. And the meanest of these
  five is this: stinginess as to the Dhamma….

“Without abandoning these five things, one is incapable of
  realizing the fruit of stream entry.”

—[[AN10.171]]—[[AN5.257]]

“Without abandoning these five things, one is incapable of
  realizing the fruit of stream entry. Which five? Stinginess as to
  one’s monastery [lodgings], stinginess as to one’s family [of
  supporters], stinginess as to one’s gains, stinginess as to one’s
  status, and ingratitude.”

—[[AN5.259]]

“These five are a person of integrity’s gifts. Which five? A
  person of integrity gives a gift with a sense of conviction. A
  person of integrity gives a gift attentively. A person of
  integrity gives a gift in season. A person of integrity gives a
  gift with an empathetic heart. A person of integrity gives a gift
  without adversely affecting himself or others.”

—[[AN5.148]]

**Discernment** is the character trait of the
    stream-enterer that is most directly related to the cutting of
    the fetter of self-identity views. However, its implications
    spread to other facets of right view as well. In fact,
    “consummate in view” is one of the epithets for a
    stream-enterer. The impact of being consummate in view extends,
    not only to one’s intellectual life, but also to one’s
    emotional life as well.

 
“There is the case where a monk, having gone to the
  wilderness, to the root of a tree, or to an empty dwelling,
  considers thus: ‘Is there any internal enthrallment unabandoned
  in me that, enthralled with which, my enthralled mind would not
  know or see things as they actually are?’ If a monk is enthralled
  with sensual passion, then his mind is enthralled. If he is
  enthralled with ill will, then his mind is enthralled. If he is
  enthralled with sloth and torpor, then his mind is enthralled. If
  he is enthralled with restlessness and anxiety, then his mind is
  enthralled. If he is enthralled with uncertainty, then his mind
  is enthralled. If a monk is absorbed in speculation about this
  world, then his mind is enthralled. If a monk is absorbed in
  speculation about the other world, then his mind is enthralled.
  If a monk is given to arguing and quarreling and disputing,
  stabbing others with weapons of the mouth, then his mind is
  enthralled.

“He discerns that, ‘There is no enthrallment unabandoned in me
  that, enthralled with which, my enthralled mind would not know
  and see things as they actually are. My mind is well directed for
  awakening to the truths.’ This is the first knowledge attained by
  him that is noble, transcendent, not held in common with
  run-of-the-mill people.

“Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones considers thus:
  ‘When I cultivate, develop, and pursue this view, do I personally
  obtain tranquility, do I personally obtain Unbinding?’

“He discerns that, ‘When I cultivate, develop, and pursue this
  view, I personally obtain tranquility, I personally obtain
  Unbinding.’ This is the second knowledge attained by him that is
  noble, transcendent, not held in common with run-of-the-mill
  people.

“Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones considers thus:
  ‘Is there, outside of this [Dhamma & Vinaya], any other
  contemplative or brahman endowed with the sort of view with which
  I am endowed?’

“He discerns that, ‘There is no other contemplative or brahman
  outside [the Dhamma & Vinaya] endowed with the sort of view with
  which I am endowed.’ This is the third knowledge attained by him
  that is noble, transcendent, not held in common with
  run-of-the-mill people.

“Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones considers thus:
  ‘Am I endowed with the character of a person consummate in view?’
  What is the character of a person consummate in view? This is the
  character of a person consummate in view: Although he may commit
  some kind of offence for which a means of rehabilitation has been
  laid down, still he immediately confesses, reveals, and discloses
  it to the Teacher or to wise companions in the holy life; having
  done that, he undertakes restraint for the future. Just as a
  young, tender infant lying on his back, when he has hit a live
  ember with his hand or his foot, immediately draws back; in the
  same way, this is the character of a person consummate in view:
  although he may commit some kind of offence for which a means of
  rehabilitation has been laid down, still he immediately
  confesses, reveals, and discloses it to the Teacher or to wise
  companions in the holy life; having done that, he undertakes
  restraint for the future.

“He discerns that, ‘I am endowed with the character of a
  person consummate in view.’ This is the fourth knowledge attained
  by him that is noble, transcendent, not held in common with
  run-of-the-mill people.

“Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones considers thus:
  ‘Am I endowed with the character of a person consummate in view?’
  What is the character of a person consummate in view? This is the
  character of a person consummate in view: although he may be
  active in the various affairs of his companions in the holy life,
  he still has a keen regard for training in heightened virtue,
  training in heightened mind, & training in heightened
  discernment. Just as a cow with a new calf watches after her calf
  all the while she is grazing on grass, in the same way, this is
  the character of a person consummate in view: Although he may be
  active in the various affairs of his companions in the holy life,
  he still has a keen regard for training in heightened virtue,
  training in heightened mind, & training in heightened
  discernment.

“He discerns that, ‘I am endowed with the character of a
  person consummate in view.’ This is the fifth knowledge attained
  by him that is noble, transcendent, not held in common with
  run-of-the-mill people.

“Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones considers thus:
  ‘Am I endowed with the strength of a person consummate in view?’
  What is the strength of a person consummate in view? This is the
  strength of a person consummate in view: When the Dhamma & Vinaya
  proclaimed by the Tathagata is being taught, he heeds it, gives
  it attention, engages it with all his mind, hears the Dhamma with
  eager ears.

“He discerns that, ‘I am endowed with the strength of a person
  consummate in view.’ This is the sixth knowledge attained by him
  that is noble, transcendent, not held in common with
  run-of-the-mill people.

“Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones considers thus:
  ‘Am I endowed with the strength of a person consummate in view?’
  What is the strength of a person consummate in view? This is the
  strength of a person consummate in view: When the Dhamma & Vinaya
  proclaimed by the Tathagata is being taught, he gains
  understanding in the meaning, gains understanding in the Dhamma,
  gains gladness connected with the Dhamma.

“He discerns that, ‘I am endowed with the strength of a person
  consummate in view.’ This is the seventh knowledge attained by
  him that is noble, transcendent, not held in common with
  run-of-the-mill people.

“A disciple of the noble ones thus possessed of seven factors
  has well examined the character for the realization of the fruit
  of stream entry. A disciple of the noble ones thus possessed of
  seven factors is endowed with the fruit of stream entry.”

“There is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a
  learner, standing at the level of a learner, can discern that ‘I
  am a learner,’ and whereby a monk who is an adept [i.e., an
  arahant], standing at the level of an adept, can discern that ‘I
  am an adept.’

“And what is the manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a
  learner, standing at the level of a learner, can discern that ‘I
  am a learner’? There is the case where a monk is a learner. He
  discerns, as it actually is, that ‘This is stress… This is the
  origination of stress… This is the cessation of stress… This is
  the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress.’ This is
  a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner, standing
  at the level of a learner, can discern that ‘I am a learner.’

“Furthermore, the monk who is a learner reflects, ‘Is there
  outside of this [Dhamma & Vinaya] any contemplative or brahman
  who teaches the true, genuine, & accurate Dhamma like the Blessed
  One?’ And he discerns, ‘No, there is no contemplative or brahman

  accurate Dhamma like the Blessed One.’ This too is a manner of

  of a learner, can discern that ‘I am a learner.’

“Furthermore, the monk who is a learner discerns the five
  faculties: the faculty of conviction… persistence… mindfulness…

—[[SN48.53]]

Then Anathapindika the householder went to where the wanderers
  of other persuasions were staying. On arrival he greeted them
  courteously. After an exchange of friendly greetings &
  courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there, the
  wanderers said to him, “Tell us, householder, what views the
  contemplative Gotama has.”

“Venerable sirs, I don’t know entirely what views the Blessed
  One has.”

“Well, well. So you don’t know entirely what views the
  contemplative Gotama has. Then tell us what views the monks
  have.”

“I don’t even know entirely what views the monks have.”

“So you don’t know entirely what views the contemplative
  Gotama has or even that the monks have. Then tell us what views
  you have.”

“It wouldn’t be difficult for me to expound to you what views
  I have. But please let the venerable ones expound each in line
  with his position, and then it won’t be difficult for me to
  expound to you what views I have.”

When this had been said, one of the wanderers said to
  Anathapindika the householder, *“The cosmos is eternal.*
  Only this is true; anything otherwise is worthless. This is the
  sort of view I have.”

Another wanderer said to Anathapindika, *“The cosmos is not
  eternal.* Only this is true; anything otherwise is worthless.
  This is the sort of view I have.”

Another wanderer said, *“The cosmos is finite…”…”The cosmos
  is infinite…”…”The soul & the body are the same…”…”The soul is
  one thing and the body another…”…”After death a Tathagata
  exists…”…”After death a Tathagata does not exist…”…”After death a
  Tathagata both does & does not exist…”…”After death a Tathagata
  neither does nor does not exist.* Only this is true; anything
  otherwise is worthless. This is the sort of view I have.”

When this had been said, Anathapindika the householder said to
  the wanderers, “As for the venerable one who says, *‘The
  cosmos is eternal.* Only this is true; anything otherwise is
  worthless. This is the sort of view I have,” his view arises from
  his own inappropriate attention or in dependence on the words of
  another. Now this view has been brought into being, is
  fabricated, willed, dependently originated. Whatever has been
  brought into being, is fabricated, willed, dependently
  originated, that is inconstant. Whatever is inconstant is stress.
  This venerable one thus adheres to that very stress, submits
  himself to that very stress.” [Similarly with the other
  positions.]

When this had been said, the wanderers said to Anathapindika
  the householder, “We have each & every one expounded to you in
  line with our own positions. Now tell us what views you
  have.”

“Whatever has been brought into being, is fabricated, willed,
  dependently originated, that is inconstant. Whatever is
  inconstant is stress. Whatever is stress is not me, is not what I
  am, is not my self. This is the sort of view I have.”

“So, householder, whatever has been brought into being, is
  fabricated, willed, dependently originated, that is inconstant.
  Whatever is inconstant is stress. You thus adhere to that very
  stress, submit yourself to that very stress.”

“Venerable sirs, whatever has been brought into being, is
  fabricated, willed, dependently originated, that is inconstant.
  Whatever is inconstant is stress. Whatever is stress is not me,
  is not what I am, is not my self. Having seen this well with
  right discernment as it actually is present, I also discern the
  higher escape from it as it actually is present.”

When this was said, the wanderers fell silent, abashed,
  sitting with their shoulders drooping, their heads down,
  brooding, at a loss for words. Anathapindika the householder,
  perceiving that the wanderers were silent, abashed…at a loss for
  words, got up & went to the Blessed One. On arrival, having bowed
  down to the Blessed One, he sat to one side. As he was sitting
  there, he told the Blessed One the entirety of his conversation
  with the wanderers.

[The Blessed One said:] “Well done, householder. Well done.
  That is how you should periodically & righteously refute those
  foolish men.” Then he instructed, urged, roused, and encouraged
  Anathapindika the householder with a talk on Dhamma. When
  Anathapindika the householder had been instructed, urged, roused
  and encouraged by the Blessed One with a talk on Dhamma, he got
  up from his seat and, having bowed down to the Blessed One, left,
  keeping the Blessed One on his right side. Not long afterward,
  the Blessed One addressed the monks: “Monks, even a monk who has
  long penetrated the Dhamma in this Dhamma & Vinaya would do well,
  periodically & righteously, to refute the wanderers of other
  persuasions in just the way Anathapindika the householder has
  done.”

## Rewards ^sigil_toc_id_14

Many of the passages describing the rewards of stream entry
    focus on the stream-enterer’s fate after death: He/she will
    never be reborn on a plane lower than the human, and will tend
    to experience exceptional happiness wherever reborn. As for the
    number of rebirths remaining for the stream-enterer before
    total Unbinding, the texts distinguish three levels of
    attainment.

 
“[Some,] with the wasting away of the three fetters, are
  ‘one-seed-ers’ *(ekabijin):* After taking rebirth only one
  more time on the human plane, they will put an end to stress.

“Or, not breaking through to that, not penetrating that, with
  the wasting away of the three fetters they are
  ‘family-to-family-ers’ *(kolankola):* After transmigrating
  & wandering on through two or three more families [according to
  the Commentary, this phrase should be interpreted as ‘through two
  to six more states of becoming’], they will put an end to
  stress.

“Or, not breaking through to that, not penetrating that, with
  the wasting away of the three fetters they are
  ‘seven-times-at-most-ers’ *(sattakkhattuparama):* After
  transmigrating & wandering on among devas & human beings, they
  will put an end to stress.”

—[[AN5.75]]

[The Buddha is speaking to Nandaka, the chief minister of the
  Licchavis, concerning the factors of stream entry:] “A disciple
  of the noble ones endowed with these four qualities is a
  stream-winner, steadfast, never again destined for states of woe,
  headed for self-awakening.

“Furthermore, a disciple of the noble ones endowed with these
  four qualities is linked with long life, human or divine; is
  linked with beauty, human or divine; is linked with happiness,
  human or divine; is linked with status, human or divine; is
  linked with influence, human or divine.

“I tell you this, Nandaka, not having heard it from any other
  contemplative or brahman. Instead, I tell you this having known,
  seen, and realized it for myself.”

When this was said, a certain man said to Nandaka, the chief
  minister of the Licchavis, “It is now time for your bath,
  sir.”

[Nandaka responded,] “Enough, I say, with this external bath.
  I am satisfied with this internal bath: confidence in the Blessed
  One.”

—[[SN55.30]]

The Canon often places great importance on the power of the
    last mental state before death in determining one’s future
    plane of existence. However, the power of stream entry is so
    great that it can overcome even a muddled state of mind at
    death, ensuring that the next rebirth will be a good one.

 
As he was sitting there, Mahanama the Sakyan said to the
  Blessed One, “Lord, this Kapilavatthu is rich & prosperous,
  populous & crowded, its alleys congested. Sometimes, when I enter
  Kapilavatthu in the evening after visiting with the Blessed One
  or with the monks who inspire the mind, I meet up with a runaway
  elephant, a runaway horse, a runaway chariot, a runaway cart, or
  a runaway person. At times like that, my mindfulness with regard
  to the Blessed One gets muddled, my mindfulness with regard to
  the Dhamma… the Sangha gets muddled. The thought occurs to me,
  ‘If I were to die at this moment, what would be my destination?
  What would be my future course?’”

“Have no fear, Mahanama. Have no fear. Your death will not be
  a bad one, your demise will not be bad. If one’s mind has long
  been nurtured with conviction, nurtured with virtue, nurtured
  with learning, nurtured with generosity, nurtured with
  discernment, then when the body—endowed with form, composed of
  the four primary elements, born from mother & father, nourished
  with rice & porridge, subject to inconstancy, rubbing, pressing,
  dissolution, & dispersion—is eaten by crows, vultures, hawks,
  dogs, hyenas, or all sorts of creatures, nevertheless the
  mind—long nurtured with conviction, nurtured with virtue,
  learning, generosity, & discernment—rises upward and separates
  out.

“Suppose a man were to throw a jar of ghee or a jar of oil
  into a deep lake of water, where it would break. There the shards
  & jar-fragments would go down, while the ghee or oil would rise
  upward and separate out. In the same way, if one’s mind has long
  been nurtured with conviction, nurtured with virtue, nurtured
  with learning, nurtured with generosity, nurtured with
  discernment, then when the body… is eaten by crows, vultures,
  hawks, dogs, hyenas, or all sorts of creatures, nevertheless the
  mind… rises upward and separates out.”

—[[SN55.21]]

[Ven. Ananda is speaking to Anathapindika:] “A well-instructed
  disciple of the noble ones, when endowed with these four
  qualities [the factors of stream entry], has no terror, no
  trepidation, no fear at death with regard to the next life.”

—[[SN55.27]]

“Then there is the case of the person who has no doubt or
  perplexity, who has arrived at certainty with regard to the True
  Dhamma. Then he comes down with a serious disease. As he comes
  down with a serious disease, the thought occurs to him, ‘I have
  no doubt or perplexity. I have arrived at certainty with regard
  to the True Dhamma.’ He doesn’t grieve, isn’t tormented; doesn’t
  weep, beat his breast, or grow delirious. This, too, is a person
  who, subject to death, is not afraid or in terror of death.”

—[[AN4.184]]

“Just as it’s not easy to take the measure of the water in the
  great ocean as ‘just this many pails of water or hundreds of
  pails of water or thousands of pails of water or hundreds of
  thousands of pails of water.’ It’s reckoned simply as a great
  mass of water that is unreckonable, immeasurable. In the same
  way, when a disciple of the noble ones is endowed with these four
  bonanzas of merit, bonanzas of skillfulness [the factors of
  stream entry], it’s not easy to take the measure of the merit as
  ‘just this much bonanza of merit, bonanza of skillfulness,
  nourishment of bliss, heavenly, ripening in bliss leading to
  heaven, leading to what is agreeable, pleasing, charming, happy,
  & beneficial.’ It’s reckoned simply as a great mass of merit that
  is unreckonable, immeasurable.”

—[[SN55.41]]

“Monks, even though a wheel-turning emperor, having exercised
  sovereign lordship over the four continents, on the break-up of
  the body, after death, reappears in the good destination, the
  heavenly world, in the company of the devas of the Thirty-three,
  and enjoys himself there in the Nandana grove, surrounded by a
  consort of nymphs, supplied and endowed with the five strings of
  heavenly sensual pleasure, still—because he is not endowed with
  four qualities—he is not freed from [the possibility of going to]
  hell, not freed from the animal womb, not freed from the realm of
  hungry ghosts, not freed from the plane of deprivation, the bad
  destinations, the lower realms.

“And even though a disciple of the noble ones lives off lumps
  of almsfood and wears rag-robes, still—because he is endowed with
  four qualities—he is freed from hell, freed from the animal womb,
  freed from the realm of hungry ghosts, freed from the plane of
  deprivation, the bad destinations, the lower realms.

“And what are the four? There is the case where the disciple
  of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the
  Awakened One… verified confidence in the Dhamma… verified
  confidence in the Sangha…. He/she is endowed with virtues that
  are appealing to the noble ones…. He/she is endowed with these
  four qualities.

“And between the gaining of the four continents and the
  gaining of these four qualities, the gaining of the four
  continents is not equal to one sixteenth of the gaining of these
  four qualities.”

—[[SN55.1]]

Sole dominion over the earth,

going to heaven,

lordship over all worlds:

The fruit of Stream entry

excels them.

—[[DHP|DHP178]]

Then the Blessed One, picking up a little bit of dust with the
  tip of his fingernail, said to the monks, “What do you think,
  monks? Which is greater: the little bit of dust I have picked up
  with the tip of my fingernail, or the great earth?”

“The great earth is far greater, lord. The little bit of dust
  the Blessed One has picked up with the tip of his fingernail is
  next to nothing. It’s not a hundredth, a thousandth, a one
  hundred-thousandth—this little bit of dust the Blessed One has
  picked up with the tip of his fingernail—when compared with the
  great earth.”

“In the same way, monks, for a disciple of the noble ones who
  is consummate in view, an individual who has broken through [to
  stream entry], the suffering & stress totally ended &
  extinguished is far greater. That which remains in the state of
  having at most seven remaining lifetimes is next to nothing: it’s
  not a hundredth, a thousandth, a one hundred-thousandth, when
  compared with the previous mass of suffering. That’s how great
  the benefit is of breaking through to the Dhamma, monks. That’s
  how great the benefit is of obtaining the Dhamma eye.”

—[[SN13.1]]

“Suppose, monks, that there were a pond fifty leagues wide,
  fifty leagues long, & fifty leagues deep, filled to overflowing
  with water so that a crow could drink from it, and a man would
  draw some water out of it with the tip of a blade of grass. What
  do you think? Which would be greater: the water drawn out with
  the tip of the blade of grass or the water in the pond?”

“The water in the pond would be far greater, lord. The water
  drawn out with the tip of the blade of grass would be next to
  nothing. It wouldn’t be a hundredth, a thousandth, a one
  hundred-thousandth—the water drawn out with the tip of the blade
  of grass—when compared with the water in the pond.”

—[[SN13.2]]

“Suppose, monks, that the great ocean were to go to
  extinction, to its total end, except for two or three drops of
  water. What do you think? Which would be greater: the water in
  the great ocean that had gone to extinction, to its total end, or
  the two or three remaining drops of water?”

“Lord, the water in the great ocean that had gone to
  extinction, to its total end, would be far greater. The two or
  three remaining drops of water would be next to nothing. They
  wouldn’t be a hundredth, a thousandth, a one
  hundred-thousandth—the two or three remaining drops of water—when
  compared with the water in the great ocean that had gone to
  extinction, to its total end.”

“In the same way, monks, for a disciple of the noble ones who
  is consummate in view, an individual who has broken through [to
  stream entry], the suffering & stress totally ended &
  extinguished is far greater. That which remains in the state of
  having at most seven remaining lifetimes is next to nothing: it’s
  not a hundredth, a thousandth, a one hundred-thousandth, when
  compared with the previous mass of suffering. That’s how great
  the benefit is of breaking through to the Dhamma, monks. That’s
  how great the benefit is of obtaining the Dhamma eye.”

—[[SN13.8]]

Not all of the rewards of stream entry concern one’s fate at
    death. Many of them pertain also to the here-and-now.

 
Then Anathapindika the householder went to the Blessed One
  and, on arrival, having bowed down to the Blessed One, sat to one
  side. As he was sitting there, the Blessed One said to him,
  “When, for a disciple of the noble ones, five forms of fear &
  animosity are stilled; when he is endowed with the four factors
  of stream entry; and when, through discernment, he has rightly
  seen & rightly ferreted out the noble method, then if he wants he
  may state about himself: ‘Hell is ended; animal wombs are ended;
  the state of the hungry ghosts is ended; states of deprivation,
  destitution, the bad bourns are ended! I am a stream-winner,
  steadfast, never again destined for states of woe, headed for
  self-awakening!’

“Now, which five forms of danger & animosity are stilled?

“When a person takes life, then with the taking of life as a
  requisite condition, he produces fear & animosity in the here &
  now, produces fear & animosity in future lives, experiences
  mental concomitants of pain & despair; but when he refrains from
  taking life, he neither produces fear & animosity in the here &
  now nor does he produce fear & animosity in future lives, nor
  does he experience mental concomitants of pain & despair: for one
  who refrains from taking life, that fear & animosity is thus
  stilled.

“When a person steals… engages in illicit sex… tells lies…

“When a person drinks distilled & fermented drinks that cause
  heedlessness, then with the drinking of distilled & fermented
  drinks that cause heedlessness as a requisite condition, he
  produces fear & animosity in the here & now, produces fear &
  animosity in future lives, experiences mental concomitants of
  pain & despair; but when he refrains from drinking distilled &
  fermented drinks that cause heedlessness, he neither produces
  fear & animosity in the here & now nor does he produce fear &
  animosity in future lives, nor does he experience mental
  concomitants of pain & despair: for one who refrains from
  drinking distilled & fermented drinks that cause heedlessness,
  that fear & animosity is thus stilled.

“These are the five forms of fear & animosity that are
  stilled.”

—[[AN10.92]]

“These are the five rewards of conviction in a lay person.
  Which five?

“When the truly good people in the world show compassion, they
  will first show compassion to people of conviction, and not to
  people without conviction. When visiting, they first visit people
  of conviction, and not people without conviction. When accepting
  gifts, they will first accept those from people with conviction,
  and not from people without conviction. When teaching the Dhamma,
  they will first teach those with conviction, and not those
  without conviction. A person of conviction, on the break-up of
  the body, after death, will arise in a good destination, the
  heavenly world. These are the five rewards of conviction in a lay
  person.

“Just as a large banyan tree, on level ground where four roads
  meet, is a haven for the birds all around, even so a lay person
  of conviction is a haven for many people: monks, nuns, male lay
  followers, & female lay followers.”

A massive tree

whose branches carry fruits & leaves,

with trunks & roots

& an abundance of fruits:

There the birds find rest.

In that delightful sphere

they make their home.

Those seeking shade

come to the shade,

those seeking fruit

find fruit to eat.

 

So with the person consummate

in virtue & conviction,

humble, sensitive, gentle,

delightful, & mild:

To him come those without effluent—

free from passion,

free from aversion,

free from delusion—

the field of merit for the world.

 

They teach him the Dhamma

that dispels all stress.

And when he understands,

he is freed from effluents,

totally unbound.

—[[AN5.38]]

## Advice ^sigil_toc_id_15

Although it would be pleasant to conclude this study guide
    with the above passages of encouragement, we would probably do
    better to follow the example of the Buddha, who directed his
    last words to his stream-enterer disciples, encouraging them
    not to rest content with the rewards awaiting them, but to
    maintain instead an attitude of heedfulness.

 
Then the Blessed One addressed the monks, “Now, then, monks, I
  exhort you: All fabrications are subject to decay. Bring about
  completion through heedfulness.” Those were the Tathagata’s last
  words.

—[[DN16]]

“And what is heedfulness? There is the case where a monk
  guards his mind with regard to effluents and qualities
  accompanied by effluents. When his mind is guarded with regard to
  effluents and qualities accompanied by effluents, the faculty of
  conviction goes to the culmination of its development. The
  faculty of persistence… mindfulness… concentration… discernment
  goes to the culmination of its development.

—[[SN48.56]]

“And how, Nandiya, does a disciple of the noble ones live
  heedlessly? There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones
  is endowed with verified confidence in the Awakened One…. Content
  with that verified confidence in the Awakened One, he does not
  exert himself further in solitude by day or seclusion by night.
  For him, living thus heedlessly, there is no joy. There being no
  joy, there is no rapture. There being no rapture, there is no
  calm. There being no calm, he dwells in pain. When pained, the
  mind does not become concentrated. When the mind is
  unconcentrated, phenomena do not become manifest. When phenomena
  are not manifest, he is reckoned simply as one who dwells
  heedlessly.

“Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with
  verified confidence in the Dhamma…. verified confidence in the
  Sangha… virtues that are appealing to the noble ones: untorn,
  unbroken, unspotted, unsplattered, liberating, praised by the
  wise, untarnished, leading to concentration. Content with those
  virtues pleasing to the noble ones, he does not exert himself
  further in solitude by day or seclusion by night. For him, living
  thus heedlessly, there is no joy. There being no joy, there is no
  rapture. There being no rapture, there is no calm. There being no
  calm, he dwells in pain. When pained, the mind does not become
  concentrated. When the mind is unconcentrated, phenomena do not
  become manifest. When phenomena are not manifest, he is reckoned
  simply as one who dwells heedlessly….

“And how, Nandiya, does a disciple of the noble ones live
  heedfully? There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones
  is endowed with verified confidence in the Awakened One…. Not
  content with that verified confidence in the Awakened One, he
  exerts himself further in solitude by day or seclusion by night.
  For him, living thus heedfully, joy arises. In one who has joy,
  rapture arises. In one who has rapture, the body becomes calm.
  When the body is calm, one feels pleasure. Feeling pleasure, the
  mind becomes concentrated. When the mind is concentrated,
  phenomena become manifest. When phenomena are manifest, he is
  reckoned as one who dwells heedfully.

“And what is the individual attained to view? There is the
  case where a certain individual does not remain touching with his
  body those peaceful liberations that transcend form, that are
  formless, but—having seen with discernment—some of his
  fermentations are ended, and he has reviewed & examined with
  discernment the qualities [or: teachings] proclaimed by the
  Tathagata. This is called an individual who is attained to view.
  Regarding this monk, I say that he has a task to do with
  heedfulness. Why is that? [I think:] ‘Perhaps this venerable one,
  when making use of suitable resting places, associating with
  admirable friends, balancing his [mental] faculties, will reach &
  remain in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen
  rightly go forth from home into homelessness, knowing & realizing
  it for himself in the here & now.’ Envisioning this fruit of
  heedfulness for this monk, I say that he has a task to do with
  heedfulness.”

—[[MN70]]

“Mahanama, a discerning lay follower who is diseased, in pain,
  severely ill should be reassured by another discerning lay
  follower with four reassurances: ‘Be reassured, friend, that you
  are endowed with verified confidence in the Awakened One…
  verified confidence in the Dhamma… verified confidence in the
  Sangha… virtues that are appealing to the noble ones: untorn,
  unbroken, unspotted, unsplattered, liberating, praised by the
  wise, untarnished, leading to concentration.’

“Mahanama, when a discerning lay follower who is diseased, in
  pain, severely ill has been reassured by another discerning lay
  follower with these four reassurances, he should be asked:
  ‘Friend, are you concerned for your mother & father?’ If he
  should say, ‘I am…,’ he should be told, ‘You, my dear friend, are
  subject to death. If you feel concern for your mother & father,
  you’re still going to die. If you don’t feel concern for your
  mother & father, you’re still going to die. It would be good if
  you abandoned concern for your mother & father.’

“If he should say, “My concern for my mother & father has been
  abandoned,’ he should be asked, ‘Friend, are you concerned for
  your wife & children?’ If he should say, ‘I am…,’ he should be
  told, ‘You, my dear friend, are subject to death. If you feel
  concern for your wife & children, you’re still going to die. If
  you don’t feel concern for your wife & children, you’re still
  going to die. It would be good if you abandoned concern for your
  wife & children.’

“If he should say, “My concern for my wife & children has been
  abandoned,’ he should be asked, ‘Friend, are you concerned for
  the five strings of human sensuality?’ If he should say, ‘I am…,’
  he should be told, ‘Friend, divine sensual pleasures are more
  splendid & more refined than human sensual pleasures. It would be
  good if, having raised your mind above human sensual pleasures,
  you set it on the Devas of the Four Great Kings.’

“If he should say, ‘My mind is raised above human sensual
  pleasures and is set on the Devas of the Four Great Kings,’ he
  should be told, ‘Friend, the Devas of the Thirty-three are more
  splendid & more refined than the Devas of the Four Great Kings.
  It would be good if, having raised your mind above the Devas of
  the Four Great Kings, you set it on the Devas of the
  Thirty-three.’

“If he should say, ‘My mind is raised above the Devas of the
  Four Great Kings and is set on the Devas of the Thirty-three,’ he
  should be told, ‘Friend, the Devas of the Hours are more splendid
  & more refined than the Devas of the Thirty-three… the Contented
  Devas are more splendid & more refined than the Devas of the
  Hours… the Devas Delighting in Creation are more splendid & more
  refined than the Contented Devas… the Devas Wielding Power over
  the Creations of Others are more splendid & more refined than the
  Devas Delighting in Creation… the Brahma world is more splendid
  and more refined than the Devas Wielding Power over the Creations
  of Others. It would be good if, having raised your mind above the
  Devas Wielding Power over the Creations of Others, you set it on
  the Brahma world.’

“If he should say, ‘My mind is raised above the Devas Wielding
  Power over the Creations of Others and is set on the Brahma
  world,’ he should be told, ‘Friend, even the Brahma world is
  inconstant, impermanent, included in self-identity. It would be
  good if, having raised your mind above the Brahma world, you
  brought it to the cessation of identity.’

“If he should say, ‘My mind is raised above the Brahma worlds
  and is brought to the cessation of identity,’ then, I tell you,
  Mahanama, there is no difference—in terms of release—between the
  release of that lay follower whose mind is released and the
  release of a monk whose mind is released.”

—[[SN55.54]]

“Therefore, Dighavu, when you are established in these four
  factors of stream entry, you should further develop six qualities
  conducive to clear knowing. Remain focused on inconstancy in all
  fabrications, percipient of stress in what is inconstant,
  percipient of not-self in what is stressful, percipient of
  abandoning, percipient of dispassion, percipient of cessation.
  That’s how you should train yourself.”

# Glossary

**Arahant:** A “worthy one” or “pure
    one”; a person whose mind is free of defilement and is thus not
    subject to further rebirth. A title for the Buddha and his
    highest level of noble disciples.

**Asava:** Effluent; fermentation.
    Four qualities—sensuality, views, becoming, and ignorance—that
    “flow out” of the mind and create the flood of the round of
    death and rebirth.

**Deva (devata):** Literally, “shining
    one.” An inhabitant of the heavenly realms.

**Dhamma:** (1) Event; action; (2) a
    phenomenon in and of itself; (3) mental quality; (4) doctrine,
    teaching; (5) nibbana (although there are passages describing
    nibbana as the abandoning of all dhammas). Sanskrit form:
    *Dharma.*

**Jhana:** Mental absorption. A state
    of strong concentration focused on a single sensation or mental
    notion. This term is derived from the verb *jhayati,*
    which means to burn with a still, steady flame.

**Kamma:** Intentional act. Sanskrit
    form: *Karma.*

**Nibbana:** Literally, the
    “unbinding” of the mind from passion, aversion, and delusion,
    and from the entire round of death and rebirth. As this term
    also denotes the extinguishing of a fire, it carries
    connotations of stilling, cooling, and peace. “Total nibbana”
    in some contexts denotes the experience of Awakening; in
    others, the final passing away of an arahant. Sanskrit form:
    *Nirvana.*

**Sangha:** Community. On the
    conventional *(sammati)* level, this term denotes the
    communities of Buddhist monks and nuns. On the ideal
    *(ariya)* level, it denotes those followers of the
    Buddha, lay or ordained, who have attained at least stream
    entry.

**Tathagata:** Literally, “one who has
    become authentic *(tatha-agata)*”or “one who is truly
    gone *(tatha-gata)*.” An epithet used in ancient India
    for a person who has attained the highest religious goal. In
    Buddhism, it usually denotes the Buddha, although occasionally
    it also denotes any of his arahant disciples.

**Vinaya:** The monastic discipline.
    The Buddha’s own term for the religion he founded was “this
    Dhamma-Vinaya.”

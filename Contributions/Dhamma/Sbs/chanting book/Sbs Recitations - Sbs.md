Pāli-English Recitations

*In whatever way a bhikkhu recites the Dhamma in detail as he has heard it and learned it, in just that way, in relation to that Dhamma, he experiences inspiration in the meaning and inspiration in the Dhamma. As he does so, joy arises in him. When he is joyful, rapture arises. For one with a rapturous mind, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body feels pleasure. For one feeling pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated.*

# Purpose and Benefits of Dhamma Recitation

    Historical Background
  

After finding the path to *Nibbāna* and some initial hesitation, the Buddha eventually decided to teach the Dhamma ([[MN26]]). His first disciples were a group of five monks, and with the awakening of one of them, Ven. Kondañña, the wheel of Dhamma was set in motion ([[SN56.11]]). While these first disciples were taught exclusively by the Buddha himself, soon afterwards more monks reached the final goal. Subsequently, the Buddha sent out the first sixty arahants to teach the Dhamma ([[SN35.11]] Vin I 20).

During that period of ancient India, religious texts were not commonly written down. Even for the purpose of ordinary education, most learning occurred through memorization. Writing was known but not used for religious texts which were considered too sacred to be put into writing; instead they were meant to live in the minds and hearts of those who saw their value, and made the effort to memorize them. In particular, the Brahmins were known for their proficiency in committing their corpus of sacred texts (*Vedas*) to memory and maintaining them with astonishing accuracy. Part of their skill can be attributed to the fact that memorization started from a young age. Likewise, also in Buddhist literature we can discover clear traces of standardization and mnemonic tools to ensure accuracy and to make memorization easier. In particular, the use of recurring stock phrases makes it easier to commit a large corpus of texts to memory (Anālayo, 2019). There is not much known about the specific teachings shared with their audience by the first arahants who went out to teach the Dhamma. But it is fair to assume that they took some teachings with them that were brief and easy to memorize. Let us also keep in mind that the Buddha’s disciples were not trained in memorization from childhood, but they came from all walks of life – young, old, educated, uneducated etc. Only when the Saṅgha had grown in size, monks who specialized in recitation travelled all across India and shared the Buddha’s teachings with those eager to hear them (Analayo, 2007).

A passage that illustrates the Buddha’s own appreciation of recitation stems from a conversation he had with a monk who had gone forth just recently. Without warning, the Buddha asked him to recite the Dhamma. The newly ordained monk recited the *Aṭṭhakavagga* of *Sutta Nipāta* ([[UD5.6]]). The Buddha was pleased and complimented the monk on his skills in remembering, keeping in mind, articulating, and enunciating the texts. This highlights the Buddha’s emphasis that recitation of the Dhamma was meant to be taken seriously by his ordained disciples.

    The Workings of Memory
  

Contrary to our intuition, memory doesn’t function like a scanner or copying machine that takes a snapshot of a text or event, and saves it for later. Instead, anecdotal memory works in a relational manner. The brain links new information that comes in through any of the six senses to concepts based on memories from the past. We understand new things in the light of and from the perspective of, things we already know. Likewise, we remember old things through the filters and biases of the present moment. It is so natural for us to draw inferences that we are often unaware that we are doing so (Eysenck, 1992/2005). This interplay between past and present gives our memory great potential due to its seemingly unlimited storage capacity (the Buddha recollected past lifetimes from memory, counting back many eons of world-dissolution and evolution). At the same time the interplay between past and future also makes memory inherently unreliable. The importance of memorization becomes clear. When texts are memorized literally, personal interpretation, biases, and coloring by past experiences and present circumstances have less opportunity to distort the information. Accuracy increases further if one checks the memorized text from time to time against its original, either by looking it up in a book, or by reciting it together with others. In this way, differences become apparent straight away.

    Benefits for Dhamma Practice
  

In the discourses the Buddha is often depicted taking up the topic of recitation when explaining to monks the proper way to learn the teachings, and to make these teachings the vessel within which their own wisdom can grow.

He has learned much, remembers what he has learned, and accumulates what he has learned. Those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, which proclaim the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life—such teachings as these he has learned much of, retained in mind, recited verbally, mentally investigated, and penetrated well by view. This is the fifth cause and condition that leads to obtaining the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual life. ([[AN8.2]])

In our current age of easy access to Dhamma books and multimedia, it is tempting to conclude that it is now not necessary anymore to memorize large bodies of texts for the sake of transmission, and that we are blessed with being able to read any of the texts at any time, from the comfort of our kuṭis or living rooms. And blessed we are. Nonetheless, even today recitation has benefits that surpass a regular silent reading, or even reading out loud. As seen in the earlier quote from [[AN8.2]] the Buddha doesn’t only speak about reciting the texts verbally, but also about retaining them in mind and investigating them mentally. This is where the benefits of recitation differ considerably from a more casual reading, or even from chanting with the help of a chanting book. By means of committing a text to memory, it lives much deeper within our minds and hearts, and we can reflect on it whenever and wherever we choose. Dhamma that has been well-memorized, is always with us. The Buddha’s teachings become accessible in the very moment we need them, without having to resort to a book or an e-reader.

Since right view is the first of the eight path factors, it is of great importance for progress on the path to keep the Buddha’s teachings in mind so that they can shape our views and perspectives. By keeping them actively in memory one can recognize their relevance whenever a situation in life occurs when they naturally manifest, or when they are most necessary to intentionally recall. Recollecting the Dhamma can be a source of joy, leading to rapture, tranquility, and concentration ([[AN5.26]]); factors that can lead to a pleasant abiding here and now. It can also help to abandon drowsiness ([[AN7.61]]), as well as speed up recovery from illness ([[AN46.16]]), or to achieve a stage of awakening even on the deathbed ([[AN6.56]]). In fact, reciting the Dhamma is one of the occasions that can even bring about the attainment of final liberation ([[AN5.26]]).

“Though the bhikkhu Phagguṇa’s mind had not yet been liberated from the five lower fetters, when he heard that discourse on the Dhamma, his mind was liberated from them… There are, Ānanda, these six benefits of listening to the Dhamma at the proper time and of examining the meaning at the proper time. What six?

...At the time of his death he does not get to see the Tathāgata or a disciple of the Tathāgata, but he ponders, examines, and mentally inspects the Dhamma as he has heard it and learned it. As he does so, his mind is liberated in the unsurpassed extinction of the acquisitions. This is the sixth benefit of examining the meaning at the proper time. ([[AN6.56]])

In whatever way the bhikkhu recites the Dhamma in detail as he has heard it and learned it, in just that way, in relation to that Dhamma, he experiences inspiration in the meaning and inspiration in the Dhamma. As he does so, joy arises in him. When he is joyful, rapture arises. For one with a rapturous mind, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body feels pleasure. For one feeling pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated. This is the third basis of liberation, by means of which, if a bhikkhu dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute, his unliberated mind is liberated, his undestroyed taints are utterly destroyed, and he reaches the as-yet-unreached unsurpassed security from bondage. ([[AN5.26]])”

    Benefits for Rebirth
  

The depth to which a mere reading of a text penetrates the mind is incomparable to the depth of penetration that can be reached by memorization. [[AN4.191]] depicts monks who have memorized the Dhamma, and are subsequently reborn in circumstances with little to no exposure to the Dhamma. The discourse explains that not only in the current lifetime, but also in lifetimes ahead, the Dhamma that was previously memorized will be accessible and has a chance of being re-cognized or recollected even in a future existence, e.g. as a *deva*. With the support of sufficient samādhi, not only can the Dhamma be recollected, but even one’s past lives:

Bhikkhus, ...there are things to be realized by memory… And what are the things to be realized by memory? One’s past abodes are to be realized by memory. ([[AN4.189]])

    Benefits for Communal Life
  

Besides being of benefit to one’s own Dhamma practice, and the benefits during future lifetimes, reciting the Dhamma can also have a beneficial impact on communal life. Accounts of the Buddhist councils (*saṅgīti*; lit. recitations) show that in all these important events of Buddhist history when the extended Saṅgha family came together, the DhammaVinaya was recited together, as a means to remain aligned with the teachings and to foster harmony. Another feature of monastic communities, is the fortnightly recitation of the *Pātimokkha*, the rules for monks and nuns, in which even solitary forest dwellers, including Arahants, were encouraged by the Buddha to participate, as they made their way to the nearest monastery in the vicinity (Mv.II.5.5). Recitation of texts together not only strengthens a common commitment to the DhammaVinaya, but in a more practical way, it also enables monastics to chant in sync and unison when reciting together with their spiritual companions. This not only increases clarity and understanding, but also makes for a more homogenous listening experience at a ceremony, e.g. a dāna or bereavement service conducted by monastics. Furthermore, the coming together frequently to recite the Buddha’s teachings creates a bond among Saṅgha members and leads to their growth. This would not be so if everyone recited the Dhamma on his own.

“And what, bhikkhus, are the seven principles of non-decline? (1) As long as the bhikkhus assemble often and hold frequent assemblies, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline. (2) As long as the bhikkhus assemble in harmony, adjourn in harmony, and conduct the affairs of the Saṅgha in harmony, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline. ([[AN7.23]])”

    Recitation Among Monastics
  

While it is not uncommon in our current time and age that teachers share the Dhamma without any reference to the Buddha or his teachings, in the Buddha’s time the teachings were passed on from teacher to disciple by means of recitation. The Vinaya texts explain that *if the preceptor wants one to recite [C: memorize passages of Dhamma or Vinaya], one should recite. If he wants to interrogate one [C: on the meaning of the passages], one should answer his interrogation.* (Cv.VIII.11.8)

BMC I mentions that the *Vibhaṅga* to *Pācittiya* 4 lists four ways in which a person might be trained to be a reciter of a text:

- The teacher and student recite in unison, i.e. beginning together and ending together.

- The teacher begins a line, the student joins in, and they end together.

- The teacher recites the beginning syllable of a line together with the student, who then completes it alone.

- The teacher recites one line, and the student recites the next line alone.

In order for a monk to be free from dependence (*nissaya*) on a teacher, *he must be learned and intelligent, knowing both Pāṭimokkhas... and must have been ordained as a bhikkhu for at least five years (Mv.I.53.5-13)*.

The Commentary says that a learned bhikkhu must have memorized:

- Both *Pātimokkhas* (for the *bhikkhus* and *bhikkhunīs*).

- The Four *Bhāṇavāras* — a set of auspicious chants, still regularly memorized in Sri Lanka as the *Mahā-pirit poṭha*; *one bhāṇavāra* is comprised of 8,000 syllables.

- A discourse that is helpful as a guide for sermon-giving.

- Three kinds of *anumodanā* (rejoicing in the merit of others) chants: for meals; for auspicious merit-making ceremonies, such as blessing a house; and for non-auspicious ceremonies, i.e. any relating to a death.

Lastly, when monastics from other sects wanted to become monks in the Buddha’s dispensation, they typically had to undergo a four-month probation period. However, *a probationer fails in his probation and is not to be accepted... if he does not have a keen desire for recitation (Mv.I.38.5-10).*

Once again, we can see the immense emphasis that was placed on memorization and recitation, starting already during the Buddha’s own ministry, and continuing all the way to the 21st century, where we can still find monks who are able to memorize the entirety of the *Tipiṭaka*.

    What to Recite
  

While recitation and memorization of the Dhamma yields several benefits, and one may be committed to dedicate some amount of time to this worthwhile endeavor, one important task remains. Given the limited amount of texts one may be able to memorize and maintain in memory, the task is to select the texts for recitation and memorization from the vast amount of teachings the Buddha left behind. What is essential? What is of secondary importance? Once again, we are in the fortunate situation that the Buddha himself gave guidance in what he regarded as the core teachings. In [[MN104]] the Buddha points to a set of 37 teachings, commonly known as the Wings of Awakening (*bodhipakkhiyā dhammā*). Included in these 37 Dhammas are the four foundations of mindfulness, the four right strivings, the four bases of spiritual power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven factors of awakening, and the noble eightfold path. ([[DN16]]). Other teachings that are commonly held in high esteem are The Discourse on Turning the Wheel of Dhamma (*Dhammacakkappavattana-sutta*), The Gradual Training, and The Dhamma in Brief. All of these are teachings that can help the earnest practitioner to gain an overview of the Dhamma and one’s path to liberation. Practicing accordingly, as well as, further recollection and recitation of such teachings also helps to correctly assess one’s own progress on the path.

Besides these general teachings, the Buddha also went into great depth in explaining the most profound doctrines, some of which are related to the conceptual framework surrounding the practice, while others are directly related to formal meditation. Early sermons that stand out in this context are The Discourse on the Characteristic of Not-Self (*Anatta-lakkhaṇa-sutta*), The Discourse on the Exposition on Burning (*Āditta-pariyāya-sutta*), the Buddha’s First and Final Words, Mindfulness of Breathing, and Dependent Origination. All of these are profound, deep teachings that highlight key aspects of the path to awakening. These are teachings that are good to memorize and recite again and again ([[AN10.48]]), allowing their deep meaning to gradually seep into our hearts.

From these profound teachings we can take a step back to the practical, day-to-day perceptions that the Buddha specifically recommended to be frequently reflected upon. In this category we find The Five and The Ten Subjects for Frequent Reflection, also the reflections on The Four Requisites, and a separate reflection on The Repulsiveness of Food. Recollection of Impermanence, The Three Characteristics, and The Thirty-Two Parts are also frequently mentioned in the discourses. Perceptions that are closely related to the second path factor of the noble eightfold path, i.e. right thought (*sammā saṅkappa*), are the *Metta Sutta* and The Divine Abidings. Perceptions that arouse the four Brahmavihāras can seamlessly lead the practitioner towards the eighth path factor, *sammā samādhi*. At times when energy is lacking, however, chants that inspire, motivate, or arouse urgency, can be used to heat up and revitalize the practice. This is where Striving According to the Dhamma, The Burdens, Respect for the Dhamma, and the Miscellaneous Verses can come to the rescue.

Lastly, this recitation book also includes passages that illuminate how to establish good relations among fellow practitioners, such as the Principles of Cordiality, Principles of Non-Decline, and The Four Great References. Also included are chants that monks commonly perform as services to the laity, such as Anumodanā, Sharing of Merits, and Funeral Recitations.

To summarize, memorization of the Dhamma and group recitation fulfill a variety of different purposes and benefits, ranging from mundane aspects such as the ability to recite in unison and the fostering of communal harmony, all the way to the attainment of final liberation.

    When to Recite
  

The chants within this book have been arranged thematically in such a way (see the Recitation Schedule), that they can be recited on a rotation basis over a period of 10 days. Each set/day can be recited in approximately 35 to 40 minutes, depending on the fluency and speed of the reciter or chanting leader.

    How to Recite

## The Buddha’s First Exclamation

    Buddha-paṭhama-bhāsita
  

〈 Handa mayaṁ buddha-paṭhama-bhāsita-gāthāyo bhaṇāmase 〉

Aneka-jāti-saṁsāraṁ – Sandhāvissaṁ anibbisaṁ

Gaha-kāraṁ gavesanto – Dukkhā jāti punappunaṁ

For many lifetimes in the round of birth

Wandering on endlessly

For the builder of this house I searched

How painful is repeated birth

Gaha-kāraka diṭṭho’si – Puna gehaṁ na kāhasi

Sabbā te phāsukā bhaggā – Gaha-kūṭaṁ visaṅkhataṁ

Visaṅkhāra-gataṁ cittaṁ – Taṇhānaṁ khayam’ajjhagā

House-builder you’ve been seen

Another home you will not build

All your rafters have been snapped

Dismantled is your ridge-pole

The non-constructing mind

Has come to craving’s end

## Respect for the Dhamma

    Dhamma-gārava
  

〈 Handa mayaṁ dhamma-gārav’ādi-gāthāyo bhaṇāmase 〉

Ye ca atītā sambuddhā – Ye ca buddhā anāgatā

Yo c’eta’r’ahi sambuddho – Bahunnaṁ soka-nāsano

All the Buddhas of the past

All the Buddhas yet to come

The Buddha of this current age

Dispellers of much sorrow

Sabbe saddhamma-garuno – Vihariṁsu viharanti ca

Atho’pi viharissanti – Esā buddhāna dhammatā

Those having lived or living now

Those living in the future

All do revere the True Dhamma

That is the nature of all Buddhas

Tasmā hi atta-kāmena – Mahattam’abhikaṅkhatā

Saddhammo garu-kātabbo – Saraṁ buddhāna’sāsanaṁ

Therefore desiring one’s own welfare

Pursuing greatest aspirations

One should revere the True Dhamma

Recollecting the Buddha’s teaching

[[[AN7.23]]]

Na hi dhammo adhammo ca – Ubho sama-vipākino

Adhammo nirayaṁ neti – Dhammo pāpeti suggatiṁ

What is true Dhamma and what’s[[#^en30appendix|30]] not

Will never have the same results

While wrong[[#^en31appendix|31]] Dhamma leads to hell realms

True Dhamma takes one on a good course

Dhammo have rakkhati dhamma-cāriṁ

Dhammo suciṇṇo sukham’āvahāti

Es’ānisaṁso dhamme suciṇṇe

Na duggatiṁ gacchati dhamma-cārī[[#^en32appendix|32]]

And leads to happiness when practised well

This is the blessing of well-practised Dhamma

The Dhamma-farer does not go on a bad course

## Going to True and False Refuges

    Khem’ākhema-saraṇa-gamana

Bahuṁ ve saraṇaṁ yanti – Pabbatāni vanāni ca

Ārāma-rukkha-cetyāni – Manussā bhaya-tajjitā

To many refuges they go

To mountain slopes and forest glades

To parkland shrines and sacred sites

People overcome by fear

N’etaṁ kho saraṇaṁ khemaṁ – N’etaṁ saraṇam’uttamaṁ

N’etaṁ saraṇam’āgamma – Sabba-dukkhā pamuccati

Such a refuge is not secure

Such a refuge is not supreme

Such a refuge does not bring

Complete release from all suffering[[#^en33appendix|33]]

Yo ca buddhañ’ca dhammañ’ca – Saṅghañ’ca saraṇaṁ gato

Cattāri ariya-saccāni – Samma-ppaññāya passati

Whoever goes for refuge[[#^en34appendix|34]]

To the Buddha the Dhamma and the Saṅgha[[#^en35appendix|35]]

Sees with right discernment

The Four Noble Truths

Dukkhaṁ dukkha-samuppādaṁ – Dukkhassa ca atikkamaṁ

Ariyañ’c’aṭṭh’aṅgikaṁ maggaṁ – Dukkh’ūpasama-gāminaṁ

Suffering and its origin

And that which lies beyond

The Noble Eightfold Path

That leads the way to suffering’s end

Etaṁ kho saraṇaṁ khemaṁ – Etaṁ saraṇam’uttamaṁ

Etaṁ saraṇam’āgamma – Sabba-dukkhā pamuccati

Such a refuge is secure

Such a refuge is supreme

Such a refuge truly brings

Complete release from all suffering

Patient endurance is the highest austerity[[#^en37appendix|37]]

Nibbānaṁ paramaṁ vadanti buddhā

The Buddhas say Nibbāna is supreme

Na hi pabbajito par’ūpaghātī

Not a renunciant is one who injures others

Samaṇo hoti paraṁ viheṭhayanto

Whoever troubles others can’t be called a monk

## The Three Characteristics

    Ti-lakkhaṇā

Sabbe saṅkhārā aniccā’ti – Yadā paññāya passati

Atha nibbindati dukkhe – Esa maggo visuddhiyā

All conditioned things are impermanent[[#^en38appendix|38]]

When with wisdom this is seen

One feels weary of all dukkha[[#^en39appendix|39]]

This is the path to purity

Sabbe saṅkhārā dukkhā’ti – Yadā paññāya passati

Atha nibbindati dukkhe – Esa maggo visuddhiyā

All conditioned things are dukkha

When with wisdom this is seen

One feels weary of all dukkha

This is the path to purity

Sabbe dhammā anattā’ti – Yadā paññāya passati

Atha nibbindati dukkhe – Esa maggo visuddhiyā

All things are not-self[[#^en40appendix|40]]

When with wisdom this is seen

One feels weary of all dukkha

This is the path to purity

[[[DHP|DHP277-279]]]

Appakā te manussesu – Ye janā pāra-gāmino

Ath’āyaṁ itarā pajā – Tīram’ev’ānudhāvati

Few amongst humankind

Are those who go beyond

Yet there are the many folks

Ever wandering on this shore

Ye ca kho samma’d’akkhāte – Dhamme dhamm’ānuvattino

Te janā pāram’essanti – Maccu-dheyyaṁ suduttaraṁ

Wherever Dhamma is well-taught

Those who train in line with it

Are the ones who will cross over

The realm of death so hard to flee

Kaṇhaṁ dhammaṁ vippahāya – Sukkaṁ bhāvetha paṇḍito

Okā anokam’āgamma – Viveke yattha dūramaṁ

Tatr’ābhiratim’iccheyya – Hitvā kāme akiñcano

Abandoning the darker states

The wise pursue the bright

Gone from home to homelessness[[#^en41appendix|41]]

Living withdrawn so hard to enjoy[[#^en42appendix|42]]

Such rare delight one should desire

Sense pleasures cast away

Not having anything

## The Burdens

    Bhārā
  

〈 Handa mayaṁ bhāra-sutta-gāthāyo bhaṇāmase 〉

Bhārā have pañca-kkhandhā – Bhāra-hāro ca puggalo

Bhār’ādānaṁ dukkhaṁ loke – Bhāra-nikkhepanaṁ sukhaṁ

The five aggregates indeed are burdens

The beast of burden is the person[[#^en43appendix|43]]

In this world to take up burdens is dukkha

Putting them down brings happiness

Nikkhipitvā garuṁ bhāraṁ – Aññaṁ bhāraṁ anādiya

Samūlaṁ taṇhaṁ abbuyha – Nicchāto parinibbuto

A heavy burden cast away

Not taking on another load

With craving pulled out from the root

Desires stilled ’ one is released

## From the Elder Raṭṭhapāla

    Raṭṭhapāla-thera-gāthā
  

〈 Handa mayaṁ raṭṭhapālatthera-gāthāyo bhaṇāmase 〉

Passa cittakataṁ bimbaṁ – Arukāyaṁ samussitaṁ

Āturaṁ bahu-saṅkappaṁ – Yassa n’atthi dhuvaṁ ṭhiti

See this fancy puppet

A body built of sores

Diseased ’ obsessed over

Which does not last at all

Passa cittakataṁ rūpaṁ – Maṇinā kuṇḍalena ca

Aṭṭhiṁ tacena onaddhaṁ – Saha vatthehi sobhati

See this fancy figure

With its gems and earrings

It is bones wrapped in skin

Made pretty by its clothes

Alattaka-katā pādā – Mukhaṁ cuṇṇaka-makkhitaṁ

Alaṁ bālassa mohāya – No ca pāragavesino

Feet adorned with henna dye

And powder smeared upon its face

May be enough to beguile a fool

But not a seeker of the far shore

Aṭṭha-pada-katā kesā – Nettā añjana-makkhitā

Alaṁ bālassa mohāya – No ca pāragavesino

Hair in eight braids

And eyeliner

May be enough to beguile a fool

But not a seeker of the far shore

Añjanī’va navā cittā – Pūtikāyo alaṅ’kato

Alaṁ bālassa mohāya – No ca pāragavesino

A rotting body all adorned

Like a freshly painted unguent pot

May be enough to beguile a fool

But not a seeker of the far shore

Passāmi loke sadhane manusse

Laddhāna vittaṁ na dadanti mohā

Luddhā dhanaṁ sannicayaṁ karonti

Bhiyyo’va kāme abhipatthayanti

I see rich people in the world

Who from delusion give not the wealth they’ve earned

Greedily they hoard their riches

Yearning for ever more sense pleasures

Rājā ca aññe ca bahū manussā

Avītataṇhā maraṇaṁ upenti

Ūnā’va hutvāna jahanti dehaṁ

Kāmehi lokamhi na h’atthi titti

Not just the king but others too

Reach death not rid of craving

They leave the body still wanting

For in this world sense pleasures never satisfy

Na dīgham’āyuṁ labhate dhanena

Na c’āpi vittena jaraṁ vihanti

Appaṁ h’idaṁ jīvitam’āhu dhīrā

Asassataṁ vippariṇāma-dhammaṁ

Longevity is not gained by riches

Nor does wealth banish ageing

For the wise say this life is short

Subject to change ’ and not eternal

Tasmā hi paññā’va dhanena seyyā

Yāya vosānam’idh’ādhigacchati

Abyositattā hi bhav’ābhavesu

Pāpāni kammāni karoti mohā

Therefore wisdom is much better than wealth

By which one reaches perfection in this life

People through ignorance do evil deeds

Failing to reach the goal ’ from life to life

Kāmā hi citrā madhurā manoramā

Virūparūpena mathenti cittaṁ

Ādīnavaṁ kāmaguṇesu disvā

Tasmā ahaṁ pabbajito’mhi rāja

Sense pleasures are diverse ’ sweet ’ delightful

Appearing in disguise they disturb the mind

Seeing danger in the cords of sense pleasure

Therefore I went forth O King

Duma-pphalānī’va patanti māṇavā

Daharā ca vuḍḍhā ca sarīrabhedā

Etam’pi disvā pabbajito’mhi rāja

Apaṇṇakaṁ sāmaññam’eva seyyo

As fruits fall from a tree ’ so people fall

Young and old ’ when the body breaks up

Seeing this too I went forth O King

Surely the ascetic life is better

## From the Elder Pārāpariya

    Pārāpariya-thera-gāthā
  

〈 Handa mayaṁ pārāpariyatthera-gāthāyo bhaṇāmase 〉

Aññathā loka-nāthamhi – Tiṭṭhante puris’uttame

Iriyaṁ āsi bhikkhūnaṁ – Aññathā dāni dissati

The behavior of the bhikkhus

These days seems different

From when the Protector of the world

The best of men was still here

Sīta-vāta-parittāṇaṁ – Hirikopīna-chādanaṁ

Matt’aṭṭhiyaṁ abhuñjiṁsu – Santuṭṭhā itar’ītare

Their robes were just for modesty

And protection from cold and wind

They ate in moderation

Content with whatever they were offered

Paṇītaṁ yadi vā lūkhaṁ – Appaṁ vā yadi vā bahuṁ

Yāpan’atthaṁ abhuñjiṁsu – Agiddhā n’ādhimucchitā

Whether food was refined or rough

A little or a lot

They ate only for sustenance

Without greed or gluttony

Jīvitānaṁ parikkhāre – Bhesajje atha paccaye

Na bāḷhaṁ ussukā āsuṁ – Yathā te āsavakkhaye

They were not so eager

For the requisites of life

Such as tonics and other supplies

As they were for the destruction of the taints

Araññe rukkha-mūlesu – Kandarāsu guhāsu ca

Vivekam’anubrūhantā – Vihaṁsu tap’parāyaṇā

In the wilderness ’ at the foot of a tree

In caves and caverns

Fostering seclusion

They lived with that as their final goal

Nīcā niviṭṭhā subharā – Mudū atthaddha-mānasā

Abyāsekā amukharā – Atthacintā vas’ānugā

They were used to simple things ’ easy to look after

Gentle ’ not stubborn at heart

Unsullied ’ not gossipy

Their thoughts were intent on the goal

Tato pāsādikaṁ āsi – Gataṁ bhuttaṁ nisevitaṁ

Siniddhā teladhārā’va – Ahosi iriyāpatho

That’s why they inspired confidence

In their movements eating and practice

Their deportment was as smooth

As a stream of oil

Yathā kaṇṭaka-ṭṭhānamhi – Careyya anupāhano

Satiṁ upaṭṭhapetvāna – Evaṁ gāme munī care

When barefoot on a thorny path

One would walk

Quite mindfully

That’s how a sage should walk in the village

Saritvā pubbake yogī – Tesaṁ vattam’anussaraṁ

Kiñ’c’āpi pacchimo kālo – Phuseyya amataṁ padaṁ

Remembering the meditators of old

And recollecting their conduct

Even in the latter days

The Deathless can still be reached

## On Protection

    Tāyana-gāthā
  

〈 Handa mayaṁ tāyana-gāthāyo bhaṇāmase 〉

Chinda sotaṁ parakkamma – Kāme panūda brāhmaṇa

Nappahāya muni kāme – Nekattam’upapajjati

Exert yourself and cut the stream

Discard sense pleasures holy man

Not letting sensual pleasures go

A sage will not reach unity[[#^en44appendix|44]]

Kayirā ce kayirāth’enaṁ – Daḷham’enaṁ parakkame

Sithilo hi paribbājo – Bhiyyo ākirate rajaṁ

Vigorously with all one’s strength

It should be done what should be done

A lax monastic life stirs up

The dust of defilements all the more[[#^en45appendix|45]]

Akataṁ dukkaṭaṁ seyyo – Pacchā tappati dukkaṭaṁ

Katañ’ca sukataṁ seyyo – Yaṁ katvā n’ānutappati

Better is not to do bad deeds

That afterwards would bring remorse

It’s rather good deeds one should do

Which having done one won’t regret

Kuso yathā duggahito – Hattham’ev’ānukantati

Sāmaññaṁ dupparāmaṭṭhaṁ – Nirayāy’ūpakaḍḍhati

As kusa grass when wrongly grasped

Will only cut into one’s hand

So does the monk’s life wrongly led

Indeed drag one to hellish states

Yaṁ’kiñci sithilaṁ kammaṁ – Saṅkiliṭṭhañ’ca yaṁ vataṁ

Saṅkassaraṁ brahmacariyaṁ – Na taṁ hoti maha-pphalan’ti

Whatever deed that’s slackly done

Whatever vow corruptly kept

The holy life led in doubtful ways

All these will never bear great fruits

By which devas and human beings

Full of need are held fast

Don’t let the opportunity pass you by

For those who have missed the opportunity

Sorrow when they arrive in hell

Pamādo rajo pamādo – Pamād’ānupatito rajo

Appamādena vijjāya – Abbahe sallam’attano

Heedlessness is dust always

Dust follows upon heedlessness[[#^en46appendix|46]]

By heedfulness by clear knowledge

Draw out the dart from yourself

[[[SNP333-336]]]

Piyato jāyatī soko – Piyato jāyatī bhayaṁ

Piyato vippamuttassa – N’atthi soko kuto bhayaṁ

## The Discourse on Blessings

    The Discourse on Blessings
  

〈 Now let us recite the verses on the highest blessings[[#^en51appendix|51]] 〉

Thus have I heard that the Blessed One

Was dwelling at Sāvatthī[[#^en52appendix|52]]

Residing at the Jeta’s Grove

In Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park

Then in the dark of the night

A radiant deva illuminated all Jeta’s Grove

She bowed down low before the Blessed One

Then standing to one side she said:

“Devas are concerned for happiness

And ever long for peace

The same is true for humankind

What then are the highest blessings?”

Avoiding those of foolish ways

Associating with the wise

And honouring those worthy of honour

These are the highest blessings

Living in places of suitable kinds

With the fruits of past good deeds

And guided by the rightful way

These are the highest blessings

Accomplished in learning and craftsman’s skills

With discipline highly trained

And speech that is true and pleasant to hear

These are the highest blessings

Providing for mother and father’s support

And cherishing family

And ways of work that are burden-free[[#^en53appendix|53]]

These are the highest blessings

Generosity and a righteous life

Offering help to relatives and kin

And acting in ways that leave no blame

These are the highest blessings

Steadfast in restraint and shunning evil ways

Avoiding intoxicants that dull the mind

And heedfulness in all things that arise

These are the highest blessings

Respectfulness and being of humble ways

Contentment and gratitude

And hearing the Dhamma at suitable times[[#^en54appendix|54]]

These are the highest blessings

Patience and willingness to accept one’s faults

Seeing venerated seekers of the truth

And discussing the Dhamma at suitable times[[#^en55appendix|55]]

These are the highest blessings

Ardent and committed[[#^en56appendix|56]] to the holy life

Seeing for oneself the Noble Truths

And the realization of Nibbāna

These are the highest blessings

Although in contact with the world

Unshaken the mind remains

Beyond all sorrow spotless secure

These are the highest blessings

They who live by following this path

Know victory wherever they go

And every place for them is safe

These are the highest blessings

## The Discourse on the Loving-Kindness to be Done

    Karaṇīya-metta-sutta
  

〈 Now let us recite the discourse on loving-kindness 〉

This is what should be done

By one who is skilled in goodness

And who knows the path of peace

Let them be able and upright

Straightforward and gentle in speech

Humble and not conceited

Contented and easily satisfied

Unburdened with duties ’ and frugal in their ways

Peaceful and calm and wise and skillful

Not proud and demanding in nature

Let them not do the slightest thing

That the wise would later reprove

Wishing in gladness and in safety

May all beings be at ease

Whatever living beings there may be

Whether they are weak or strong ’ omitting none

The great or the mighty ’ medium short or small

The seen and the unseen

Those living near and far away

Those born and to be born

May all beings be at ease

Let none deceive another

Or despise any being in any state

Let none through anger or ill-will

Wish harm upon another

Just[[#^en57appendix|57]] as a mother protects with her life

Her child her only child

So with a boundless heart

Should one cherish[[#^en58appendix|58]] all living beings

Radiating kindness ’ over the entire world

Spreading upwards to the skies

And downwards to the depths

Outwards and unbounded

Freed from hatred and ill-will

Whether standing or walking

Seated or lying down free from drowsiness

One should sustain this recollection

This is said to be the sublime abiding

By not holding wrong views[[#^en59appendix|59]]

The pure-hearted one having clarity of vision

Being freed from all sense-desires

Is not born again into this world

## The Gradual Training

〈 Now let us recite the Gradual Training 〉

“A householder or householder’s son ’ or one born in some other clan hears the Dhamma. On hearing the Dhamma he acquires faith in the Tathāgata. Possessing that faith he considers thus: “Household life is crowded and dusty ’ life gone forth is wide open. It is not easy while living at home ’ to lead the holy life utterly perfect and pure ’ as a polished shell. Suppose I shave off my hair and beard ’ put on the ochre robe ’ and go forth from home to homelessness.’ On a later occasion ’ abandoning a small or large amount of wealth ’ abandoning a small or large circle of relatives ’ he shaves off his hair and beard ’ puts on the ochre robe ’ and goes forth from home to homelessness.”

[[[MN27]] / 38 / 51]

“Now is it possible Master Gotama ’ to describe a gradual training ’ gradual practice ’ and gradual progress in this Dhamma and Vinaya?”

“It is possible to describe a gradual training ’ gradual practice ’ and gradual progress in this Dhamma and Vinaya. When the Tathāgata obtains a person to be tamed ’ he first disciplines him thus: ’Come bhikkhu be virtuous ’ dwell restrained by the Pātimokkha ’ perfect in conduct and resort ’ and seeing danger in the slightest faults ’ train by undertaking the training rules.”

[[[MN107]]]

“Having thus gone forth and possessing the bhikkhus’ training and way of life ’ abandoning the destruction of life ’ he abstains from destroying life ’ with rod and weapon laid aside ’ conscientious ’ merciful ’ he abides compassionate to all living beings. Abandoning the taking of what is not given ’ he abstains from taking what is not given ’ taking only what is given ’ expecting only what is given ’ by not stealing he abides in purity.”

“Abandoning the household life ’ he observes the holy life ’ living apart ’ abstaining from the vulgar practice of sexual intercourse.”

“Abandoning false speech ’ he abstains from false speech ’ he speaks truth ’ adheres to truth ’ is trustworthy and reliable ’ one who is no deceiver of the world. Abandoning malicious speech ’ he abstains from malicious speech ’ he does not repeat elsewhere what he has heard here ’ in order to divide those people[[#^en70appendix|70]] from these ’ nor does he repeat here what he has heard elsewhere ’ in order to divide these people from those ’ thus he is one who reunites those who are divided ’ a promoter of friendships ’ who enjoys unity ’ rejoices in unity ’ delights in unity ’ a speaker of words that promote unity. Abandoning harsh speech ’ he abstains from harsh speech ’ he speaks words that are gentle ’ pleasing to the ear ’ and loveable ’ that go to the heart ’ are courteous ’ desired by many and agreeable to many. Abandoning idle chatter ’ he abstains from idle chatter ’ he speaks at the right time ’ speaks what is fact ’ speaks on what is good ’ speaks on the Dhamma and Vinaya ’ at the right time ’ he speaks words that are worth recording ’ reasonable ’ moderate ’ and beneficial.”

“He abstains from harming seeds and plants. He practices eating one meal a day ’ abstaining from eating at night and outside the proper time.[[#^en71appendix|71]] He abstains from dancing ’ singing ’ music and seeing entertainments. He abstains from wearing garlands ’ smartening himself with scent ’ and embellishing himself with unguents. He abstains from high and luxurious sleeping places. He abstains from accepting gold and silver. He abstains from accepting raw grain. He abstains from accepting raw meat. He abstains from accepting women and girls. He abstains from accepting men and women slaves. He abstains from accepting goats and sheep. He abstains from accepting fowl and pigs. He abstains from accepting elephants ’ cattle ’ horses and mares. He abstains from accepting fields and land.”

“He abstains from running errands and messages. He abstains from buying and selling. He abstains from false weights ’ false metals ’ and false measures. He abstains from accepting bribes ’ deceiving ’ defrauding ’ and trickery. He abstains from wounding ’ murdering ’ binding ’ robbery ’ plunder and violence.”

“He becomes content with robes to protect his body ’ and almsfood to maintain his stomach ’ and wherever he goes he sets out taking only these with him. Just as a bird ’ wherever it goes flies with its wings as its only burden ’ so too the bhikkhu becomes content with robes to protect his body ’ and almsfood to maintain his stomach ’ and wherever he goes he sets out taking only these with him. Possessing this aggregate of noble virtue ’ he experiences within himself a bliss that is blameless.”

[[[MN51]]]

“Then the Tathāgata disciplines him further: “Come bhikkhu ’ guard the doors of your sense faculties. On seeing a form with the eye ’ do not grasp at its signs and features. Since if you were to leave the eye faculty unguarded ’ evil unwholesome states of longing and grief might invade you ’ practice the way of its restraint ’ guard the eye faculty ’ undertake the restraint of the eye faculty. On hearing a sound with the ear. On smelling an odour with the nose. On tasting a flavour with the tongue. On touching a tangible with the body. On cognizing a mind-object with the mind ’ do not grasp at its signs and features. Since if you were to leave the mind faculty unguarded ’ evil unwholesome states of longing and grief might invade you ’ practice the way of its restraint ’ guard the mind faculty ’ undertake the restraint of the mind faculty.”

“Come bhikkhu ’ be moderate in eating. Wisely reflecting I use almsfood ’ not for fun ’ not for pleasure ’ not for fattening ’ not for beautification ’ only for the maintenance and nourishment of this body ’ for keeping it healthy ’ for helping with the holy life ’ thinking thus: I will allay hunger without overeating ’ so that I may continue to live blamelessly and at ease.”

“Come bhikkhu ’ be devoted to wakefulness. During the day ’ while walking back and forth and sitting ’ purify your mind of obstructive states. In the first watch of the night ’ while walking back and forth and sitting ’ purify your mind of obstructive states. In the middle watch of the night ’ you should lie down on the right side ’ in the lion’s pose ’ with one foot overlapping the other ’ mindful and fully aware ’ after noting in your mind the time for rising. After rising in the third watch of the night ’ while walking back and forth and sitting ’ purify your mind of obstructive states.”

“Come bhikkhu ’ be possessed of mindfulness and full awareness. Act in full awareness when going forward and returning ’ act in full awareness when looking ahead and looking away ’ act in full awareness when flexing and extending your limbs ’ act in full awareness when wearing your robes ’ and carrying your outer robe and bowl ’ act in full awareness when eating ’ drinking ’ consuming food ’ and tasting ’ act in full awareness when defecating and urinating ’ act in full awareness when walking ’ standing ’ sitting ’ falling asleep ’ waking up[[#^en72appendix|72]] ’ talking ’ and keeping silent.”

“Come bhikkhu ’ resort to a secluded resting place: a forest ’ the foot of a tree ’ a mountain ’ a ravine ’ a hillside cave ’ a charnel ground ’ a jungle thicket ’ an open space ’ a heap of straw.”

“After his meal on returning from almsround he sits down ’ having crossed his legs ’ sets his body erect ’ having established mindfulness in front of him. Abandoning longing[[#^en73appendix|73]] for the world ’ he abides with a mind free from longing ’ he purifies his mind from longing. Abandoning ill will and hatred ’ he abides with a mind free from ill will ’ compassionate for the welfare of all living beings ’ he purifies his mind from ill will and hatred. Abandoning sloth and torpor ’ he abides free from sloth and torpor ’ percipient of light ’ mindful and fully aware ’ he purifies his mind from sloth and torpor. Abandoning restlessness and remorse ’ he abides unagitated ’ with a mind inwardly peaceful ’ he purifies his mind from restlessness and remorse. Abandoning doubt ’ he abides having gone beyond doubt ’ unperplexed about wholesome states ’ he purifies his mind from doubt.”

[[[MN107]]]

“When these five hindrances are unabandoned in himself ’ he sees them respectively as a debt ’ a disease ’ a prison ’ slavery ’ and a road across a desert. But when these five hindrances have been abandoned in himself ’ he sees that as freedom from debt ’ freedom from disease ’ release from prison ’ freedom from slavery ’ and a land of safety. Considering thus he would be glad and full of joy.”

“Having abandoned these five hindrances ’ imperfections of the mind that weaken wisdom ’ he enters upon and abides in the first Jhāna ’ the second Jhāna ’ the third Jhāna ’ the fourth Jhāna.”

“When his concentrated mind is thus purified ’ bright ’ unblemished ’ rid of imperfection ’ malleable ’ wieldy ’ steady ’ and attained to imperturbability ’ he directs it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives ’ to knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings ’ and to knowledge of the destruction of the taints.”

“He understands as it actually is: This is suffering ’ This is the origin of suffering ’ This is the cessation of suffering ’ This is the way of practice ’ leading to the cessation of suffering ’ These are the taints ’ This is the origin of the taints ’ This is the cessation of the taints ’ This is the way of practice ’ leading to the cessation of the taints.”

“When he knows and sees thus ’ his mind is liberated from the taint of sensual desire ’ from the taint of being ’ and from the taint of ignorance. When liberated there is knowledge that he is liberated. He understands: “Birth is exhausted ’ the holy life is fulfilled ’ what has to be done is done ’ there is nothing else to do for the sake of liberation.”

[[[MN39]]]

“This is my instruction to those bhikkhus who are in higher training ’ whose minds have not yet attained the goal ’ who abide aspiring to the supreme security from bondage.”

Satt’ime bhikkhave bojjh’aṅgā bhāvitā bahulī-katā

Bhikkhus when the Seven Factors of Awakening are developed and cultivated

Ariyā niyyānikā

They are noble and emancipating

Nīyanti takkarassa sammā dukkha-kkhayāya

Acting them out ’ leads to the complete destruction of suffering

[[[SN46.19]]]

Ye te bhikkhave bhikkhū

Bhikkhus those bhikkhus

Sīla-sampannā

Who are accomplished in virtue

Samādhi-sampannā

Accomplished in concentration

Ñāṇa-sampannā

Accomplished in wisdom

Vimutti-sampannā

Accomplished in liberation

Vimutti-ñāṇa-dassana-sampannā

Accomplished in the knowledge and vision of liberation:

Dassanam’p’āhaṁ bhikkhave tesaṁ bhikkhūnaṁ bahu-kāraṁ vadāmi

I say even the sight of those bhikkhus is helpful

Savanam’p’āhaṁ

Even listening to them

Upasaṅkamanam’p’āhaṁ

Payirupāsanam’p’āhaṁ

Even attending on them

Anussatim’p’āhaṁ

Anupabbajjam’p’āhaṁ

Even going forth after them is helpful

Taṁ kissa hetu

For what reason?

Tathā-rūpānaṁ bhikkhave bhikkhūnaṁ dhammaṁ sutvā

Because when one has heard the Dhamma from such bhikkhus

Dvayena vūpakāsena vūpakaṭṭho viharati

One dwells withdrawn by way of two kinds of withdrawal

Kāya-vūpakāsena ca citta-vūpakāsena ca

Withdrawal of body and withdrawal of mind

So tathā vūpakaṭṭho viharanto

Dwelling thus withdrawn

Taṁ dhammaṁ anussarati anuvitakketi

One recollects that Dhamma and thinks it over

So tathā sato viharanto

Dwelling thus mindfully

Taṁ dhammaṁ paññāya pavicinati

One discriminates that Dhamma with wisdom

Pavicarati parivīmaṁsam’āpajjati

Examines it ’ makes an investigation of it

Tassa taṁ dhammaṁ paññāya pavicinato

For one who discriminates that Dhamma with wisdom

Pavicarato parivīmaṁsam’āpajjato

Examines it ’ makes an investigation of it

Āraddhaṁ hoti vīriyaṁ asallīnaṁ

One’s energy is aroused without slackening

Āraddha-vīriyassa uppajjati pīti nirāmisā

For one who is energetic

Spiritual rapture arises

Pīti-manassa kāyo’pi passambhati

For one whose mind is uplifted by rapture

The body becomes tranquil

Cittam’pi passambhati

And the mind becomes tranquil

Passaddha-kāyassa sukhino

For one whose body is tranquil and who is happy

Cittaṁ samādhiyati

The mind becomes concentrated

So tathā-samāhitaṁ cittaṁ sādhukaṁ ajjhupekkhitā hoti

One closely looks on with equanimity

At the mind thus concentrated

## The Four Great References

    Cattāro mahāpadesā
  

〈 Handa mayaṁ mahāpadesa-sutta-pāṭhaṁ bhaṇāmase 〉

Katame bhikkhave cattāro mahāpadesā

What bhikkhus are the four great references?

Idha bhikkhave bhikkhu evaṁ vadeyya:

Here bhikkhus a bhikkhu might say:

Sammukhā me’taṁ āvuso bhagavato sutaṁ

In the presence of the Blessed One I heard this

Sammukhā paṭiggahitaṁ

In his presence I learned this

Asukasmiṁ nāma āvāse

Or in such and such a residence

Saṅgho viharati sathero sapāmokkho

A Saṅgha is dwelling with elders and prominent monks

Tassa me saṅghassa sammukhā sutaṁ

In the presence of that Saṅgha I heard this

Sammukhā paṭiggahitaṁ

In its presence I learned this

Asukasmiṁ nāma āvāse

Or in such and such a residence

Sambahulā therā bhikkhū viharanti

Many elder bhikkhus are dwelling

Bahu-ssutā āgat’āgamā

Who are learned ’ heirs to the heritage

Dhamma-dharā vinaya-dharā mātikā-dharā

Experts on the Dhamma ’ experts on the Vinaya ’ experts on the outlines

Tesaṁ me therānaṁ sammukhā sutaṁ

In the presence of those elders I heard this

Sammukhā paṭiggahitaṁ

In their presence I learned this

Asukasmiṁ nāma āvāse

Or in such and such a residence

Eko thero bhikkhu viharati

One elder bhikkhu is dwelling

Bahu-ssuto āgat’āgamo

Who is learned ’ an heir to the heritage

Dhamma-dharo vinaya-dharo mātikā-dharo

An expert on the Dhamma ’ an expert on the Vinaya ’ an expert on the outlines

Tassa me therassa sammukhā sutaṁ

In the presence of that elder I heard this

Sammukhā paṭiggahitaṁ

In his presence I learned this

Ayaṁ dhammo ayaṁ vinayo idaṁ satthu-sāsanan’ti

“This is the Dhamma ’ this is the Vinaya

This is the Teacher’s teaching!”

Tassa bhikkhave bhikkhuno bhāsitaṁ

That bhikkhu’s statement

N’eva abhinanditabbaṁ nappaṭikkositabbaṁ

Should neither be approved nor rejected

Anabhinanditvā appaṭikkositvā

Without approving or rejecting it

Padabyañjanāni sādhukaṁ uggahetvā

Having thoroughly learned those words and phrases

Sutte otāretabbāni

They ought to be found in the Suttas

Vinaye sandassetabbāni

And seen in the Vinaya

Na c’eva sutte otaranti na vinaye sandissanti

If they are neither found in the Suttas ’ nor seen in the Vinaya

Niṭṭham’ettha gantabbaṁ:

You should draw the conclusion:

Addhā idaṁ na c’eva tassa bhagavato vacanaṁ arahato sammāsambuddhassa

Surely this is not the word of the Blessed One

The Worthy One ’ the Perfectly Enlightened One

Tassa ca therassa duggahitan’ti

It has been badly learned by that elder

Iti h’etaṁ bhikkhave chaḍḍeyyātha

Only to ward off cold ’ to ward off heat ’ to ward off the touch of flies ’ mosquitoes wind burning and creeping things

Only for the sake of modesty

Paṭisaṅkhā yoniso piṇḍapātaṁ paṭisevāmi

N’eva davāya na madāya na maṇḍanāya na vibhūsanāya

Yātrā ca me bhavissati anavajjatā ca phāsuvihāro cā’ti

Wisely reflecting ’ I use almsfood

Not for fun ’ not for pleasure ’ not for fattening ’ not for beautification

Thinking thus: “I will allay hunger without overeating

So that I may continue to live blamelessly and at ease”

## The Repulsiveness of Food

    Āhāra-paṭikūla-paccavekkhaṇa-pāṭho
  

〈 Handa mayaṁ āhāra-paṭikūla-paccavekkhaṇa-pāṭhaṁ bhaṇāmase 〉

Āhāre paṭikūla-saññā-paricitena bhikkhave ’ bhikkhuno cetasā bahulaṁ viharato

When a bhikkhu often dwells with a mind

Accustomed to the perception of the repulsiveness of food

Rasa-taṇhāya cittaṁ patilīyati

His mind shrinks away from craving for tastes

Patikuṭati pativattati na sampasāriyati

Turns back from it

Rolls away from it

And is not drawn towards it

Upekkhā vā pāṭikulyatā vā saṇṭhāti

Either equanimity or disgust become settled in him

[[[AN7.49]]]

Sabbo pan’āyaṁ piṇḍapāto ajigucchanīyo

None of this almsfood is innately repulsive

Imaṁ pūti-kāyaṁ patvā

But touching this unclean body

Ativiya jigucchanīyo jāyati

It becomes disgusting indeed

## The Discourse on Turning the Wheel of Dhamma

〈 Thus have I heard 〉

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Benares ’ in the Deer Park at Isipatana. There he addressed the bhikkhus of the group of five thus:

Bhikkhus these two extremes should not be followed ’ by one who has gone forth into homelessness. What two? The pursuit of sensual happiness in sensual pleasures ’ which is low ’ vulgar ’ the way of worldlings ’ ignoble ’ unbeneficial ’ and the pursuit of self-mortification ’ which is painful ’ ignoble ’ unbeneficial

Without veering towards either of these extremes ’ the Tathāgata has awakened to the Middle Way ’ which gives rise to vision ’ which gives rise to knowledge ’ which leads to peace ’ to direct knowledge ’ to enlightenment ’ to Nibbāna

And what bhikkhus ’ is the Middle Way awakened to by the Tathāgata ’ which gives rise to vision ’ which gives rise to knowledge ’ which leads to peace ’ to direct knowledge ’ to enlightenment ’ to Nibbāna

It is this Noble Eightfold Path:

That is Right View ’ Right Intention ’ Right Speech ’ Right Action ’ Right Livelihood ’ Right Effort ’ Right Mindfulness ’ Right Concentration

This bhikkhus ’ is that Middle Way awakened to by the Tathāgata ’ which gives rise to vision ’ which gives rise to knowledge ’ which leads to peace ’ to direct knowledge ’ to enlightenment ’ to Nibbāna

Now this bhikkhus ’ is the noble truth of suffering: birth is suffering ’ ageing is suffering ’ illness is suffering ’ death is suffering ’ union with what is displeasing is suffering ’ separation from what is pleasing is suffering ’ not to get what one wants is suffering ’ in brief ’ the five aggregates subject to clinging are suffering

Now this bhikkhus ’ is the noble truth of the origin of suffering: it is this craving which leads to renewed existence ’ accompanied by delight and lust ’ seeking delight here and there ’ that is ’ craving for sensual pleasures ’ craving for existence ’ craving for extermination

Now this bhikkhus ’ is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering: it is the remainderless fading away and cessation ’ of that same craving ’ the giving up and relinquishing of it ’ freedom from it ’ non-reliance on it

Now this bhikkhus ’ is the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering: It is this Noble Eightfold Path

That is Right View ’ Right Intention ’ Right Speech ’ Right Action ’ Right Livelihood ’ Right Effort ’ Right Mindfulness ’ Right Concentration

‘This is the noble truth of suffering’: thus bhikkhus in regard to things unheard before ’ there arose in me vision ’ knowledge ’ wisdom ’ true knowledge ’ and light

‘This noble truth of suffering is to be fully understood: thus bhikkhus in regard to things unheard before ’ there arose in me vision ’ knowledge ’ wisdom ’ true knowledge ’ and light

‘This noble truth of suffering has been fully understood: thus bhikkhus in regard to things unheard before ’ there arose in me vision ’ knowledge ’ wisdom ’ true knowledge ’ and light

‘This is the noble truth of the origin of suffering’: thus bhikkhus in regard to things unheard before ’ there arose in me vision ’ knowledge ’ wisdom ’ true knowledge ’ and light

‘This noble truth of the origin of suffering is to be abandoned: thus bhikkhus in regard to things unheard before ’ there arose in me vision ’ knowledge ’ wisdom ’ true knowledge ’ and light

‘This noble truth of the origin of suffering has been abandoned: thus bhikkhus in regard to things unheard before ’ there arose in me vision ’ knowledge ’ wisdom ’ true knowledge ’ and light

‘This is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering’: thus bhikkhus in regard to things unheard before ’ there arose in me vision ’ knowledge ’ wisdom ’ true knowledge ’ and light

‘This noble truth of the cessation of suffering is to be realized: thus bhikkhus in regard to things unheard before ’ there arose in me vision ’ knowledge ’ wisdom ’ true knowledge ’ and light

‘This noble truth of the cessation of suffering has been realized: thus bhikkhus in regard to things unheard before ’ there arose in me vision ’ knowledge ’ wisdom ’ true knowledge ’ and light

‘This is the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering’: thus bhikkhus in regard to things unheard before ’ there arose in me vision ’ knowledge ’ wisdom ’ true knowledge ’ and light

‘This noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering is to be developed’: thus bhikkhus in regard to things unheard before ’ there arose in me vision ’ knowledge ’ wisdom ’ true knowledge ’ and light

‘This noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering has been developed’: thus bhikkhus in regard to things unheard before ’ there arose in me vision ’ knowledge ’ wisdom ’ true knowledge ’ and light

So long bhikkhus as my knowledge and vision ’ of these Four Noble Truths ’ as they really are ’ in their three phases and twelve aspects ’ was not entirely purified in this way ’ I did not claim to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment ’ in this world with its devas ’ Māra and Brahmā ’ in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins ’ its devas and humans

But when my knowledge and vision ’ of these Four Noble Truths ’ as they really are ’ in their three phases and twelve aspects was entirely purified in this way ’ then I claimed to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment ’ in this world with its devas ’ Māra and Brahmā ’ in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins ’ its devas and humans

This is what the Blessed One said. Elated ’ the bhikkhus of the group of five delighted in the Blessed One’s statement

And while this discourse was being spoken ’ there arose in the Venerable Kondañña the dust-freen stainless vision of the Dhamma:

Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation

And when the Wheel of the Dhamma had been set in motion by the Blessed One ’ the earth-dwelling devas raised a cry:

“At Benares in the Deer Park at Isipatana ’ this unsurpassed Wheel of the Dhamma ’ has been set in motion by the Blessed One ’ which cannot be stopped by any ascetic or brahmin or deva or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world”

Having heard the cry of the earth-dwelling devas ’ the devas of the realm of the Four Great Kings raised a cry...

Having heard the cry of the devas of the realm of the Four Great Kings ’ the Tāvatiṁsa devas raised a cry...

Having heard the cry of the Tāvatiṁsa devas ’ the Yāma devas raised a cry...

Having heard the cry of the Yāma devas ’ the Tusita devas raised a cry...

Having heard the cry of the Tusita devas ’ the Nimmānaratī devas raised a cry...

Having heard the cry of the Nimmānaratī devas ’ the Paranimmita-vasavattī devas raised a cry...

Having heard the cry of the Paranimmita-vasavattī devas ’ the devas of Brahmā’s company raised a cry:

“At Benares in the Deer Park at Isipatana ’ this unsurpassed Wheel of the Dhamma ’ has been set in motion by the Blessed One ’ which cannot be stopped by any ascetic or brahmin ’ or deva or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world”

Thus at that moment ’ at that instant ’ at that second ’ the cry spread as far as the brahmā world ’ and this ten thousandfold world system shook ’ quaked ’ and trembled ’ and an immeasurable glorious radiance appeared in the world ’ surpassing the divine majesty of the devas

Then the Blessed One uttered this inspired utterance:

Koṇḍañña has indeed understood! Koṇḍañña has indeed understood!

In this way the Venerable Koṇḍañña acquired the name ’ Aññā Koṇḍañña ’ Koṇḍañña Who Has Understood

## The Discourse on the Characteristic of Not-Self

〈 Thus have I heard 〉

On one occasion[[#^en131appendix|131]] the Blessed One was dwelling at Benares ’ in the Deer Park at Isipatana ’ There he addressed the bhikkhus of the group of five: Bhikkhus – Venerable sir they replied. The Blessed One said this:[[#^en132appendix|132]]

Bhikkhus form is not-self ’ If form were self ’ then form would not lead to affliction ’ and one could command to form: Let my form be thus ’ let my form not be thus

But since form is not-self ’ it leads to affliction ’ and none can command to form: Let my form be thus ’ let my form not be thus

Feeling is not-self ’ If feeling were self ’ then feeling would not lead to affliction ’ and one could command to feeling: Let my feeling be thus ’ let my feeling not be thus

But since feeling is not-self ’ it leads to affliction ’ and none can command to feeling: Let my feeling be thus ’ let my feeling not be thus

Perception is not-self ’ If perception were self ’ then perception would not lead to affliction ’ and one could command to perception: Let my perception be thus ’ let my perception not be thus

But since perception is not-self ’ it leads to affliction ’ and none can command to perception: Let my perception be thus ’ let my perception not be thus

Volitional formations are not-self ’ If volitional formations were self ’ then volitional formations would not lead to affliction ’ and one could command to volitional formations: Let my volitional formations be thus ’ let my volitional formations not be thus

But since volitional formations are not-self ’ they lead to affliction ’ and none can command to volitional formations: Let my volitional formations be thus ’ let my volitional formations not be thus

Consciousness is not-self ’ If consciousness were self ’ then consciousness would not lead to affliction ’ and one could command to consciousness: Let my consciousness be thus ’ let my consciousness not be thus

But since consciousness is not-self ’ it leads to affliction ’ and none can command to consciousness: Let my consciousness be thus ’ let my consciousness not be thus

〈 Bhikkhus what do you think: 〉

Is form permanent or impermanent?

Impermanent venerable sir

Is what is impermanent satisfactory or unsatisfactory?

Unsatisfactory venerable sir

Is what is impermanent unsatisfactory and subject to change fit to be regarded thus: “This is mine ’ this I am ’ this is my self?

No venerable sir

Bhikkhus what do you think: Is feeling permanent or impermanent?

Impermanent venerable sir

Is what is impermanent satisfactory or unsatisfactory?

Is what is impermanent unsatisfactory and subject to change fit to be regarded thus: “This is mine ’ this I am ’ this is my self?

Is what is impermanent unsatisfactory and subject to change fit to be regarded thus: “This is mine ’ this I am ’ this is my self?

No venerable sir

Bhikkhus what do you think: Are volitional formations permanent or impermanent?

Is what is impermanent satisfactory or unsatisfactory?

Unsatisfactory venerable sir

Is what is impermanent unsatisfactory and subject to change fit to be regarded thus: “This is mine ’ this I am ’ this is my self?

No venerable sir

〈 Therefore bhikkhus 〉

Any kind of form whatsoever ’ whether past future or present ’ internal or external ’ gross or subtle ’ inferior or superior ’ far or near ’ must be seen with right wisdom as it really is: This is not mine ’ this I am not ’ this is not my self

Any kind of feeling whatsoever ’ whether past future or present ’ internal or external ’ gross or subtle ’ inferior or superior ’ far or near ’ must be seen with right wisdom as it really is: This is not mine ’ this I am not ’ this is not my self

Any kind of perception whatsoever ’ whether past future or present ’ internal or external ’ gross or subtle ’ inferior or superior ’ far or near ’ must be seen with right wisdom as it really is: This is not mine ’ this I am not ’ this is not my self

Any kind of volitional formations whatsoever ’ whether past future or present ’ internal or external ’ gross or subtle ’ inferior or superior ’ far or near ’ must be seen with right wisdom as it really is: This is not mine ’ this I am not ’ this is not my self

Any kind of consciousness whatsoever ’ whether past future or present ’ internal or external ’ gross or subtle ’ inferior or superior ’ far or near ’ must be seen with right wisdom as it really is: This is not mine ’ this I am not ’ this is not my self

〈 Bhikkhus when a noble disciple[[#^en133appendix|133]] 〉

Who has heard the teaching[[#^en134appendix|134]] sees thus ’ he becomes disenchanted with form ’ becomes disenchanted with feeling ’ becomes disenchanted with perception ’ becomes disenchanted with volitional formations ’ becomes disenchanted with consciousness

When he is disenchanted passion fades away ’ With the fading of passion he is liberated ’ When liberated there is knowledge that he is liberated ’ He understands: Birth is exhausted ’ the holy life is fulfilled ’ what has to be done is done ’ there is nothing else to do for the sake of liberation[[#^en135appendix|135]]

That is what the Blessed One said ’ The bhikkhus of the group of five were glad and they approved of his words ’ Now during this utterance ’ the hearts of the bhikkhus of the group of five ’ were liberated from the taints through the cessation of clinging

That is what the Blessed One said ’ The bhikkhus were glad and they approved of his words ’ Now during this utterance ’ the hearts of those thousand bhikkhus ’ were liberated from the taints through the cessation of clinging

## Verses from the Discourse on Giving at the Proper Time

    Kāla-dāna-sutta-gāthā
  

〈 Kāle dadanti sapaññā 〉

Vadaññū vīta-maccharā

Kālena dinnaṁ ariyesu

At the proper time, those wise,

Charitable, and generous folk

Give a timely gift to the noble ones,

Who are stable and upright;

Given with a clear mind,

One’s offering is vast.

Ye tattha anumodanti

Veyyāvaccaṁ karonti vā

Na tena dakkhiṇā onā

Te’pi puññassa bhāgino

Those who rejoice in such deeds

Or who provide other service

Do not miss out on the offering;

They too partake of the merit.

Tasmā dade appaṭivāna-citto

Yattha dinnaṁ maha-pphalaṁ

Puññāni para-lokasmiṁ

Patiṭṭhā honti pāṇinan’ti

Therefore, with a non-regressing mind,

One should give a gift where it yields great fruit.

Merits are the support of living beings

When they arise in the other world.

In different waters and lands:

May they come & listen with approval as I recite the word of the excellent sage.

Yad’ajjhagā sakya-munī samāhito

Na tena dhammena sam’atthi kiñci

Which they call concentration without interval

The equal of that concentration does not exist.

Cha c’ābhiṭhānāni abhabbo kātuṁ

Idam’pi saṅghe ratanaṁ paṇītaṁ

Etena saccena suvatthi hotu

Together with one’s achievement of vision

Three things are discarded:

The view of the personal entity and doubt,

And whatever good behavior and observances there are.

One is also freed from the four planes of misery

And is incapable of doing six deeds.

This too is the sublime gem in the Saṅgha:

By this truth, may there be safety!

Although one does a bad deed

By body, speech, or mind,

One is incapable of concealing it;

Such inability is stated for one who has seen the state.

Vana-ppagumbe yathā phussit’agge

Gimhāna-māse paṭhamasmiṁ gimhe

Tath’ūpamaṁ dhamma-varaṁ adesayi

Nibbāna-gāmiṁ paramaṁ hitāya

Idam’pi buddhe ratanaṁ paṇītaṁ

Etena saccena suvatthi hotu

Like a woodland thicket with flowering crests

In a summer month, in the first of the summer,

Just so he taught the excellent Dhamma,

Leading to Nibbāna, for the supreme welfare.

This too is the sublime gem in the Buddha:

By this truth, may there be safety!

Varo varaññū varado var’āharo

Anuttaro dhamma-varaṁ adesayi

Idam’pi buddhe ratanaṁ paṇītaṁ

Etena saccena suvatthi hotu

The excellent one, knower of the excellent,

Giver of the excellent, bringer of the excellent,

The unsurpassed one taught the excellent Dhamma.

This too is the sublime gem in the Buddha:

By this truth, may there be safety!

Khīṇaṁ purāṇaṁ navaṁ n’atthi sambhavaṁ

Viratta-citt’āyatike bhavasmiṁ

Te khīṇa-bījā aviruḷhi-chandā

Nibbanti dhīrā yathā’yaṁ padīpo

Idam’pi saṅghe ratanaṁ paṇītaṁ

Etena saccena suvatthi hotu

The old is destroyed, there is no new origination,

Their minds are dispassionate toward future existence.

With seeds destroyed, with no desire for growth,

Those wise ones are extinguished like this lamp.

This too is the sublime gem in the Saṅgha:

By this truth, may there be safety!

Kāmesu vineyya gedhaṁ

Na hi jātu gabbha-seyyaṁ punar-etī’ti

## Pāli Phonetics and Pronunciation

Pāli is the official scriptural language of Theravāda Buddhism. It is closely related to Sanskrit, with no written script of its own. Written forms have emerged in the scripts of other languages (e.g. Devanāgarī, Sinhala, Burmese, Khmer, Thai, Roman). The Roman script is pronounced as expected, with these clarifications:

**Vowels**

Short

                
        

Long

          a as in magma

                
        

          ā as in father
        

          i as in ill
        

                
        

          ī as in liter
        

          u as in put
        

                
        

          ū as in hula hoop
        

                
        

          e as in bed
        

                
        

          o as in for
        

Long vowels are pronounced as above, but are held for twice the length of their short counterparts. By default **e** and **o** are long vowels, but they become short if followed by double consonants e.g. *mettā*, *sotthi*. In such a case they are pronounced short as in pet and soft respectively.

Contrary to English language, Pāli does not contain diphthongs i.e. a combination of two vowels in a single syllable, in which the sound begins as one vowel and moves towards another (as in coin, loud, and side). Pāli vowels therefore sound more similar to the vowels **a**, **e**, **i**, **o**, **u** of e.g. German language.

    Consonants
  

Pāli consonants are mostly pronounced as one would expect, but with a few additional rules: Two-lettered notations with **h** (e.g. **kh**, **ch**, **ṭh**, **th**, **ḷh**, **ph**) denote an aspirated, airy sound, and should be considered as one unit. They are distinct from the hard, crisp sound of a single consonant (e.g. **k**, **c**, **ṭ**, **t**, **p**). However, other combinations with **h**, e.g., **mh**, **ñh**, and **vh**, do count as two consonants (e.g *jivhā*or *taṇhā*). Examples: **th** as in Thomas (never pronounced as in the); **ph** as in palate (never pronounced as in photo). Double consonants are pronounced with a pause before releasing the consonant e.g. kk as in bookkeeper.

**ḍ**, **ḍh**, **ḷ**, **ḷh**, **ṇ**, **ṭ**, **ṭh**

These retroflex consonants have no English equivalents. They are formed by curling the tip of the tongue back against the palate.

    Miscellaneous
  

The semivowel **v** is pronounced as in **w**e; **ñ** is pronounced as in ca**ny**on; the pure nasal **ṁ** and voiced nasal **ṅ** are pronounced as in su**ng**.

As an aid to understanding, **hyphens** (-) have often been inserted in longer Pāli compounds, in order to indicate the separate words that make up the compound. This should not affect the pronunciation during recitation in any way. In order not to suggest unintended pauses in the flow of the recitation, punctuation marks (commas, periods, colons and semicolons) were removed for most chants. **Line breaks** within a sentence indicate that a short breathing pause is inserted, but indented line breaks indicate that recitation continues without a breathing pause.

Elsewhere, **breath marks** ( ’ ) have been inserted in order to indicate breathing pauses. When reciting as a group, each participant is encouraged to recite as accurately, audibly, and continuously according to one’s capabilities; ideally from the first chant to the last without interruption, gaps, or omissions. However, passages within **brackets** 〈 ... 〉 serve as an introduction, and are recited only by the leader. Except for Pāli protection and funeral chants, there is a breathing pause after 〈 ... 〉 , before the rest of the group joins in.

## Chanting Leader Guidelines

It is both a great honour and also a great responsibility to lead a group of fellow Dhamma practitioners through Dhamma recitations. These guidelines provide tips that can help facilitate a smooth and enjoyable experience for the group of participants, as well as for the chanting leader himself.

The following points should be considered:

- Accurate Pāli Pronunciation

- Sufficient Audibility and Volume

- Determining a Suitable Tempo

- Tempo Consistency

- Determining a Suitable Pitch

- Pitch Consistency

- Continuity

    Accurate Pāli Pronunciation
  

Within the domain of Pāli pronunciation, the chanting leader shall pay special attention to long and short syllables, since this would otherwise result in a asynchronous recitation with those who accurately pronounce long and short syllables. To obtain good Pāli pronunciation, frequent chanting with those who have good pronunciation or listening and chanting along with audio recordings of well-pronounced Pāli recitations can go a long way. This helps to identify and even out idiosyncrasies that may have arisen. Of course, all other elements of accurate Pāli pronunciation too should be adhered to as much as possible (voiceless vs. voiced, aspirate vs. non-aspirate consonants etc.), but the difference between long and short syllables is the most important one in the present context.

    Sufficient Audibility and Volume
  

In order for others to be able to follow the chanting style of the chanting leader accurately, it is tantamount that he is clearly audible. The voice of the chanting leader should be louder than that of the loudest group member, so that others can follow the chanting leader’s lead with ease, rather than having to make an effort to find his voice. This is not to say that the chanting leader needs to blast everyone to such a degree that only his voice can be heard. This would defeat the purpose of group recitation. As often in Dhamma practice, a healthy balance between extremes needs to be found. However, when in doubt it is preferable if the chanting leader errs on the side of too loud, rather than too soft. Both newcomers as well as those who have memorized the chants, but are not yet fully proficient in their recollection of the chants, benefit greatly from a chanting leader whose voice has a decent volume and is clearly audible. While some individuals naturally have a voice that resonates strongly, or have trained their voice to that extent, those who are not so disposed may use a microphone for support. Using a microphone also allows the chanting leader to recite in a more relaxed manner, rather than having to constantly make sure that his voice carries to all corners of the room or hall. For chanting periods that take more than 20 minutes, there is a tendency for one’s voice to become softer and thus less penetrating compared to how it was at the beginning of the chanting session. Again, a microphone or increased effort can help to remedy this tendency.

    Determining a Suitable Tempo
  

Everyone has a preferred tempo at which one finds it pleasant to recite. It is helpful for the chanting leader to choose a tempo that allows him to maintain a clear pronunciation of Pāli terms. Even if one is able to chant accurately at high speed, it would be very difficult for newcomers and those who are not familiar with Pāli to follow along. Pāli is not our mother tongue, and fluent reading requires a lot of skill and practice. It is, therefore, important when chanting with others to choose a tempo that they can follow along comfortably without causing them to feel stressed by the end of the chant, as if having participated in a rap battle. Choosing a more meditative pace also allows the mind to process the Dhamma while reciting it; a task that is not easy for beginners. Slowing down aids in allowing for reflections and insights to arise during Dhamma recitation. At the same time, if the pace is too slow, some individuals may feel bored, or even fall asleep. Again, the right tempo usually lies somewhere between the extremes. Private recitation in one’s kuṭi or walking path, undertaken for the sake of maintaining chants in memory by rehearsing them from time to time, is usually done much faster than how one would recite with a group. This allows one to rehearse large amounts of texts in a short time, which is useful when wanting to maintain a large body of chants in one’s memory. In contrast, group recitation should follow a more moderate pace to fulfill the earlier mentioned objectives.

A regular chanting leader may ask for feedback from others regarding whether his chanting tempo is comfortable to chant along with or whether it is too fast or slow. The experience of newcomers should receive special consideration.

    Tempo Consistency
  

Once a suitable tempo has been chosen to start one’s recitation, it may be challenging to maintain the chosen tempo throughout the particular chant, or even throughout the entire chanting session. For most individuals there is a natural tendency to speed up as time goes by. It is the chanting leader’s task to prevent that from happening, unless he finds out that the speed he has chosen at the beginning of the chant is too fast or slow for himself and/or others. The ideal time for tempo adjustments is between two chants, not during a chant. The introduction line, e.g. Handa mayaṁ..., or Evaṁ me sutaṁ, can be used as an indicator for how fast or slow the chanting leader wants to recite, whereas the rest of the group shall follow whatever tempo the chanting leader has chosen. If another group member, especially one with a strong and predominant voice has a tendency to change tempo midway, or lengthen/shorten/skip syllables due to inaccurate Pāli pronunciation, the chanting leader must not follow his lead. If this is a recurrent problem with a particular group member, it is worthwhile to talk to him privately and request that he please chant more softly so that other group members can more accurately and easily follow the chanting leader’s lead.

    Determining a Suitable Pitch
  

Much of what has been stated in preceeding sections on chanting tempo, applies equally to one’s chanting pitch. Everyone has his own preferred pitch, at which his voice sounds most natural and requires the least effort to produce sound. It is helpful for the chanting leader to choose a pitch that is not too far from his natural pitch; otherwise it can become very exhausting, especially when recitation continues for longer periods. However, a certain degree of adjustment may be necessary on the part of the chanting leader, if his natural pitch happens to be far outside the average person’s range. If it is very high or very low, and thus different from that of some — or most — of the chanting participants, it can be difficult for them to match. A regular chanting leader can learn by asking for feedback from others, as to whether they find his pitch comfortable to chant along with, or whether they find it too high or too low. If it turns out that many people point out they find his pitch to be very high or low, he may deliberately adjust his pitch, while still remaining within his own comfort zone. Listening to a reference note before starting to recite, may be helpful for the chanting leader to hit the right pitch every time. A musical ear too can help, but this is very difficult to train; some even claim it’s impossible to develop. Someone who aspires to polish his skills in this area should learn one or two tricks for how to find his own comfortable pitch every time he starts to lead a chant, or he can privately approach the Saṅghapariṇāyaka for some guidance.

    Pitch Consistency
  

Once a suitable pitch has been chosen to start one’s recitation, it can be a challenging task to maintain the chosen pitch throughout one chant, and even more so throughout the entire chanting session. For many individuals there is a natural tendency to gradually drag the pitch lower and lower as time goes by. It is the chanting leader’s task to prevent that from happening, unless he feels that the pitch he has chosen at the beginning of the chant is too high or low for himself and/or others. In this case, the ideal time for making pitch corrections, is between two chants. The introduction line, e.g. Handa mayaṁ..., sets the tone, whereby the rest of the group tunes in at whatever pitch the chanting leader has chosen. Once a certain pitch has been selected, one tries to maintain it throughout the chant. If another group member, especially one with a strong and predominant voice, has a tendency to change pitch midway, one should try not to follow his lead but keep chanting in the original pitch. If this is a recurrent problem with a particular group member, it is worthwhile to talk to him privately and request that he chant more softly, so that other group members can more accurately and easily follow the chanting leader’s lead.

    Continuity
  

Individuals who do not know how to recite a particular text due to moderate prior exposure, as well as those who have memorized a text poorly, rely heavily on the chanting leader. They benefit greatly from a chanting leader whose voice can be heard throughout the entire chant. Continuity can be difficult to maintain when there is a need to breathe at places other than those when there is a breath mark, or when having to cough. At such times a chanting leader can help the group by choosing his pauses skilfully. It is particularly at the beginning of sentences/lines that certain group members may get stuck due to a lapse of memory. It is here when the voice of the chanting leader can be very helpful to get them back on track. Likewise, at the end of long lines/sentences, the chanting leader’s voice is important. Some members of the group may have run out of breath midway, and may therefore skip the last few words and start chanting again only at the next line, whereupon one may notice that the overall volume has decreased towards the end of the sentence. Here too it is important that at least the chanting leader continues until the very end of the sentence. The importance of the chanting leader’s voice to be present at the beginning and end of the line/sentence, makes the middle of the sentence the ideal time for him to take a short breathing break if necessary. In the middle of sentences, the absence of his voice may barely be noticed, since the rest of the group keeps the chant going. The second-best choice for a short break is the end of the line. However, it is imperative that the chanting leader’s voice be clearly present at the beginning of the line. In this way he helps to keep the chant going without interruption, and those who recite by heart can trust and rely on the chanting leader’s voice for their support.

    Summary
  

The above points and principles are meant to function as a guideline for aspiring chanting leaders to make their own experience as smooth as possible, without having to be stressed or insecure about making mistakes. Moreover, the rest of the group benefits from well-trained chanting leaders, who give their fellow Saṅgha members a sense of ease and comfort while reciting the words of the Buddha, allowing them to reflect on the meaning along the way. After all, recitation of the Dhamma is one of the gateways to liberation ([[AN5.209]]).

Thanks to all Saṅgha members who are willing to share this responsibility, by taking turns as chanting leaders.

# Endnotes

[[#^en1|1]] Due to the balanced and inspiring selection of chants, as well as for the sake of compatibility, WPN's *Buddhist Chanting* (2014) has served as the basis for this book. Over time, suggestions for the inclusion of additional chants, as well as occasional improvements of existing translations were incorporated. Such changes were meticulously marked down in the endnotes, so that someone familiar with the present book can straight away find the relevant differences, which can be useful when visiting a branch monastery of the Ajahn Chah lineage, in order to know in which places to revert to the original version.

[[#^en2|2]] WPN: The Lord. The underlying Pāli term is *Arahant*. Lord, however, has connotations that do not fit well to the way the Buddha is portrayed in the discourses. In dictionaries lord is commonly defined as: an appellation for a person or deity who has authority, control, or power over others, acting like a master, a chief, or a ruler. The Worthy One seems a better choice of terms, since it is also how *Arahant* was used in pre-Buddhist era. PTS explains:[Vedic *arhant*, ppr. of *arhati* (see *arahati*), meaning deserving, worthy]. Throughout this chanting book, all occurrences of *Arahant* have therefore been consistently translated as Worthy One, thus replacing previous translations, such as The Lord, Noble One etc.

[[#^en3|3]] WPN: He trains perfectly those who wish to be trained. The aspect of wishing to be trained is not found in the Pāli.

[[#^en4|4]] WPN: He has explained the spiritual life of complete purity. While spiritual life is not a bad translation, for the sake of consistency with the rest of the chanting book, this occurrence was changed to holy life.

[[#^en5|5]] To practice directly(Pāli: *uju*) means, to practice the most direct way to *Nibbāna*; the straight way; no detours.

[[#^en6|6]] WPN: Who have practiced insightfully

[[#^en7|7]] WPN: Those who practice with integrity

[[#^en8|8]] WPN: They give occasion for incomparable goodness to arise in the world

[[#^en9|9]] WPN: The teaching of the Lord like a lamp

[[#^en10|10]] WPN: Illuminating the path and its fruit, the Deathless

[[#^en11|11]] WPN: That which is beyond the conditioned world

[[#^en12|12]] WPN: To that which is worthy. This passage refers to the triple (*taya*) gems and not just to the Saṅgha.

[[#^en13|13]] One who knows things as they are is an unusual translation for *Tathāgata*. Also arisen in is better than has come into, otherwise one might think that he has come from somewhere, already being a *Tathāgata*.

[[#^en14|14]] No mention of delusion in the Pāli. It could also refer to *samsāra* or *dukkha*.

[[#^en15|15]] WPN: grief

[[#^en16|16]] WPN: In brief the five focuses of identity are *dukkha*

[[#^en17|17]] WPN: Attachment to mental formations. While the Pāli term saṅkhārā only means formations, Bhikkhu Bodhi’s rendering as volitional formations captures well the intentional/volitional forces behind the formative nature of the mind.

[[#^en18|18]] WPN: Attachment to sense-consciousness

[[#^en19|19]] WPN: Mental formations are impermanent

[[#^en20|20]] WPN: Sense-consciousness is impermanent

[[#^en21|21]] WPN: Mental formations are not-self

[[#^en22|22]] WPN: Sense-consciousness is not-self

[[#^en23|23]] WPN: All conditions are transient

[[#^en24|24]] WPN: There is no self in the created or the uncreated. While this is not a very accurate translation, it is indeed the case that the term *sabbe dhammā* includes the uncreated, *Nibbāna* (see [[AN10.21]]).

[[#^en25|25]] WPN: All of us are bound by birth ageing and death

[[#^en26|26]] WPN: grief

[[#^en27|27]] In Pāli, these terms are in plural form, however, for the sake of recitation they are kept singular.

[[#^en28|28]] WPN: All of us are bound by birth ageing and death

[[#^en29|29]] WPN: Being fully equipped with the bhikkhus’ system of training

[[#^en30|30]] WPN: what not: ‘What not’ is usually followed by what is similar. Furthermore, the meaning of *adhamma* in this context describes not only the lack of *Dhamma*, but the practice of wrong *Dhamma*.

[[#^en31|31]] WPN: lack of Dhamma This translation is problematic, because a mere lack of Dhamma does not lead to rebirth in hell; otherwise all non-Buddhists would be destined to hell. In reality, it is the view and practice of wrong Dhamma that leads to hell, which is also substantiated by the Commentary, which defines adhamma as the opposite (*paṭipakkha*) of true Dhamma.

[[#^en32|32]] This line is missing in WPN.

[[#^en33|33]] WPN: from suffering

[[#^en34|34]] WPN: Whoever goes to refuge

[[#^en35|35]] WPN: In the Triple Gem. It has been shown in Āyasma Aggacitta’s Do We Go to the Triple Gem for Refuge? that one does not go for refuge in the Triple Gem (the Buddha, Dhamma, and Ariya-saṅgha), but the discourses repeatedly depict the Buddha, Dhamma, and Bhikkhu-saṅgha as the community to take refuge in ([[DN2]] [[MN91]] [[SN12.46]] [[AN4.14]] etc.).

[[#^en36|36]] There are two variations as to the sequence of these three verses. The sequence used here follows the sequence of [[DHP|DHP183]] (*Sabba pāpassa*...), [[DHP|DHP184]] (*Khantī paramaṁ*...), [[DHP|DHP185]] (*Anūpavādo*...). In contrast, the sequence [[DHP|DHP184]] 183, 185 is commonly known as the *Ovādapātimokkha*, and occurs at [[DN14]]

[[#^en37|37]]WPN: Patient endurance is the highest practice burning out defilements

[[#^en38|38]] WPN: Impermanent are all conditioned things

[[#^en39|39]] *Dukkha* here refers to the five aggregates themselves, as explained in [[SN56.11]] The five aggregates of clinging are *dukkha*. Along similar lines, the five aggregates are called burdens in [[SN22.22]]

[[#^en40|40]] WPN: Dukkha are all conditioned things

[[#^en41|41]] WPN: From the floods dry land they reach

[[#^en42|42]] WPN: Living withdrawn so hard to do

[[#^en43|43]] WPN: The beast of burden though is man. The Pāli word *puggalo* is in masculine, which is the expected grammatical form even if a term refers to males and females alike, as is probably the case here. Furthermore, the phrase beast of burden is an English idiomatic expression, signifying an animal used for heavy work such as carrying or pulling things (Oxford Dictionary).

[[#^en44|44]] Unity here refers to unity of mind due to concentration (*samādhi*, *cittass-ekaggatā*). *Nekatta* = *na* + *ekatta* [abstr. fr. *eka*].

[[#^en45|45]] WPN: The dust of passions all the more. The Pāli only speaks of stirring up dust, but the Commentary explains that it refers to the dust of *kilesā*. As a translation for *kilesā*, the term defilements has a broader scope than just passions, wherefore the former has been given preference.

[[#^en46|46]] The meaning of this statement is somewhat cryptic. The Commentary explains as follows: *pamādo rajo* = heedlessness is dust; *pamādo pamād’ānupatito rajo* = the dust that follows heedlessness is (also) heedlessness; the Commentary further explains that this is about procrastination, e.g. I am still young, so I can afford to be heedless; maybe later I’ll be heedful.

[[#^en47|47]] WPN: *viddhā*. The Siam edition has *viddhā* (pierced) whereas the Burmese and Sri Lankan edition of the same text have *vidvā* (the wise), which seems to be the variant that better conveys the intended meaning of the text.

[[#^en48|48]] WPN: Such insight is one’s strength

[[#^en49|49]] WPN: Thus for a night of non-decline

[[#^en50|50]] WPN: a shining night of prosperty

[[#^en51|51]] The term blessing is used throughout this chanting book to convey the meaning of support, or a beneficial thing, without implying the underlying Christian connotations this term may have in popular use.

[[#^en52|52]] WPN: Was staying at Sāvatthī

[[#^en53|53]] WPN: that harm no being

[[#^en54|54]] WPN: And hearing the Dhamma frequently taught

[[#^en55|55]] WPN: And sharing often the words of Dhamma

[[#^en56|56]] WPN: ardent committed

[[#^en57|57]] WPN: Even

[[#^en58|58]] What is translated here as cherishing all living beings, could more literally be translated as developing a measureless mind towards all beings.

[[#^en59|59]] WPN: to fixed views. This paragraph deals with *Anāgāmis*, which becomes apparent from the closing statement in which it is said that by this practice one becomes free from sense desires and is not born again into this world (sense sphere). The limitation of loving-kindness practice leading only up to *Anāgāmihood* also finds confirmation by [[AN4.126]] Now, since an *Anāgāmi* has right view, which is the first factor of the noble eightfold path (even *Arahants* hold right view; [[AN10.112]]), it would therefore not be correct to say that he holds no views at all. Furthermore, even an *Anāgāmi* may still have some minor grasping to (right) view, as there can still be moments of *māna* (identification/conceit), which is overcome only by the *Arahant*. I therefore conclude that this passage here refers specifically to wrong views and does not include right view, since wrong views are the only types of views that an *Anāgāmi* has entirely left behind.

[[#^en60|60]] WPN: It is this Noble Eightfold Path

[[#^en61|61]] For some reason *byādhi’pi dukkho* is missing from the WPN version of this chanting book. The reason for this omission is unclear, because even the Thai edition of this discourse contains *byādhi’pi dukkho*. However, the definition of the four noble truths in the context of the *Satipaṭṭhānasuttas* in DN and MN do not contain *byādhi’pi dukkho*. It may be that the compilers of this chanting book copy/pasted this passage from the wrong discourse, thinking it is the same, whereas in reality there is this small difference.

[[#^en62|62]] WPN: In brief the five focuses of identity are *dukkha*

[[#^en63|63]] WPN: Light arose

[[#^en64|64]] WPN: Now this Noble Truth of *dukkha*

[[#^en65|65]] While the Pāli includes the term *ariya-saccaṁ* (“noble truth”), this clause has been omitted from the English translations of the second to fourth noble truths for the sake of brevity. As a positive side effect, this omission may inadvertently help prevent misunderstandings—specifically, the mistaken idea that one is to abandon the noble truth itself, rather than the cause of *dukkha*. Clearly, it is the cause of *dukkha*—namely, craving—that is to be abandoned, not the noble truth of *dukkha* itself. This point becomes even clearer when considering the fourth noble truth, which is to be developed. This obviously refers to the factors of the Noble Eightfold Path, not to the truth as a doctrinal concept.

[[#^en66|66]] WPN: As long *bhikkhus* as

[[#^en67|67]] The three phases are comprised of the statement of the noble truth itself, followed by what is the task that is to be performed in relation to this noble truth, followed by the statement that the task has been performed. Four truths multiplied by three phases, results in 12 aspects.

[[#^en68|68]] Instead of the nominative *abhisambuddo* (Thai and Buddha Jayanti Pāli edition), one would usually expect the accusative or a quotation here, which is indeed what is found in the PTS and Chatta Saṅgāyana editions, giving *abhisambuddho’ti*. However, the anomalous reading *abhisambuddho* finds support from *Mahāvasutu*: *yāvac cāhaṁ bhikṣavaḥ imāni catvāry āryasatyāni evaṁ triparivartaṁ dvādaśākāraṁ yathā-bhūtaṁ samyakprajñayā nābhyajñāsiṣaṁ na tāvad ahaṁ anuttarāṁ samyaksaṁbodhim abhisaṁbuddho pratijānehaṁ*, which according to Ven. Ānandajoti probably indicates that *abhisambuddho* is an old/original reading.

[[#^en69|69]] WPN: But when *bhikkhus*

[[#^en70|70]] Bhikkhu Bodhi: [those people]. Removed brackets for the sake of recitability.

[[#^en71|71]] The Vinaya defines the wrong time for eating as from noon until dawnrise of the following day.

[[#^en72|72]] Contrary to popular belief, mindfulness and full awareness is not meant to be practiced while sleeping, but only before falling asleep and after waking up.

[[#^en73|73]] WPN: covetousness

[[#^en74|74]] Descriptions of right and wrong livelihood can be found at [[AN10.46]] [[AN5.177]] [[AN6.18]] [[AN8.54]] [[AN10.91]]

[[#^en75|75]] WPN: covetousness and grief

[[#^en76|76]] WPN: He abides contemplating mind-objects as mind-objects. Since mind-object is not an ideal translation for *dhamma* in this context, it is preferable to leave *dhamma* untranslated here.

[[#^en77|77]] Quite secluded from sense pleasures means being completely and entirely secluded; not just somewhat/moderately secluded. The Pāli term *eva*, which has been translated as quite is an emphatic particle, intensifying the adjective it qualifies. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the English term quite has two connotations: 1. to the utmost – or most – absolute extent or degree; absolutely; completely; 2. To a certain or fairly significant extent or degree; fairly. It is the first connotation in which quite is used in the phrase quite secluded from sense pleasures.

[[#^en78|78]] The meaning of *pasāda* as confidence also finds expression in the qualities of a stream-enterer, who is declared to have *aveccapasāda* in the Buddha, Dhamma, and Saṅgha ([[AN5.58]]), which *Āyasmā* (Bhikkhu) Bodhi translates as unwavering confidence and *Āyasmā* (Bhikkhu) Sujāto translates as experiential confidence. The qualifier *ajjhatta* found in the stock formula of the second Jhāna is rendered as inner/self confidence. Alternative translations for *ajjhattaṁ sampasādanaṁ* would be inner serenity, inner clarity, inner joy, and it is up to the reader/reciter to reflect on these additional connotations of the term as seen fit.

[[#^en79|79]] WPN: Still feeling pleasure with the body. The Pāli doesn’t say still, but more importantly [[SN48.40]] states that physical pleasure (sukha) has ceased in third Jhāna, and mental pleasure (*somanassa*) has ceased in fourth Jhāna. Therefore, according to [[SN48.40]] *kāya* in the context of the third Jhāna stock formula cannot refer to the physical body. The Pāli commentaries agree, and explain that *kāya* here refers to the mental body, in particular to mental pleasure (*somanassa*). However, a comparative study by Prof. Kuan Tse-Fu titled *Clarification on Feelings in Buddhist Dhyāna/Jhāna Meditation* brought to light that the Chinese parallel to [[SN48.40]] has a different sequence of disappearing types of *vedanā* in the sequence of the four Jhānas. While it would go beyond the scope of this footnote to discuss the matter in detail, it is noteworthy that the parallel to [[SN48.40]] the *Aviparātaka Sūtra* of the *Āgamas*, indeed mentions that bodily pleasant feeling (*sukha*) disappears only in the fourth Jhāna, whereas mental pleasant feeling (*somanassa*) has disappeared already in the third Jhāna, alongside with the disappearance of *pīti*. In the context of this chanting book, we have therefore chosen to stay with the literal translation of the word *kāya* as body, and invite the reader to draw his own conclusions.

[[#^en80|80]] WPN: *viharatī’ti*

[[#^en81|81]] WPN: grief

[[#^en82|82]] WPN: I shall breathe in tranquillising the bodily formations. *Kāyasaṅkhāraṁ* is singular, not plural.

[[#^en83|83]] WPN: I shall breathe in experiencing the mental formation. *Cittasaṅkhāraṁ* is probably meant to be singular, not plural, but this is not always clear when looking at compounds. Considering that the subsequent practice explicitly uses mental formation in singular, this suggests that it is probably used in the same way here.

[[#^en84|84]] WPN: I shall breathe in tranquillising the mental formation. *Cittasaṅkhāraṁ* is singular, not plural.

[[#^en85|85]] While *virāga* indeed can refer to the mind’s fading away of passions (dispassion), in certain contexts *virāga* refers to fading away of any phenomena. One such instance can be found in [[MN74]] Pleasant/unpleasant/neutral feeling, Aggivessana, is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen, subject to destruction, vanishing, fading away, and ceasing. Here, *virāga* obviously does not refer to mental dispassion, but to the nature of fading away of certain phenomena i.e. feeling. Likewise, in the context of mindfulness of breathing, *virāga* can be seen as part of the natural progression of the lifecycle of any phenomena, including but not limited to the breath itself, which after its arising, goes through a phase of change (*aniccā*), gradual fading (*virāga*), and ending in its cessation (*nirodha*). The meditator observing these stages develops an attitude of letting go (*paṭinissagga*) towards it, because there is nothing that is worth clinging/adhering to ([[MN37]]).

[[#^en86|86]] This chant stems mainly from The Discourse Analysis of Dependent Origination, a sub-chapter from the The Analysis of Dependent Origination, which is part of the second book of the *Abhidhammapiṭaka* called the *Vibhaṅga* (Abh.Vibh.130f). Apart from minor variations, there is great similarity between this analysis and the analysis found in [[SN12.2]] in *Suttapiṭaka*. The first four lines of this chant stem from [[SN12.61]] which functions as an illustration of the general principle of conditionality.

[[#^en87|87]] Here and at other places of the English translation, the term a condition is used. The indefinite article a indicates that there could be other conditions as well (e.g. all previous conditions in the sequence are a condition for all subsequent ones), but the directly aforementioned condition is the predominant one (*adhipati-paccaya*) for the subsequent conditioned thing to arise.

[[#^en88|88]] Here and at other places of the English translation, the term arises is inserted, because the term *sambhavati* from *Jāti-paccayā jarā-maraṇaṁ; soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass’upāyāsā sambhavanti* applies to all 11 links (12 minus ignorance) and not only to ageing-and-death etc.

[[#^en89|89]] Elsewhere in the chanting book the term *saṅkhāra* is translated as volitional formations. Here, however, for the sake of ease of recitability in subsequent passages within this chant, it is translated as formations.

[[#^en90|90]] In the context of dependent origination, the compound *nāma-rūpa* is translated as mind-and-body in order to cover the entirety of what is conventionally called a being, a person. In other contexts, particularly if used separately, these terms may have other connotations.

[[#^en91|91]] Here and at other places of the English translation, the term arises is inserted, because the term *sambhavati* from *Jāti-paccayā jarā-maraṇaṁ; soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass’upāyāsā sambhavanti* applies to all 11 links (12 minus ignorance) and not only to ageing-and-death etc.

[[#^en92|92]] To render as Therein what is from ignorance as a condition arise formations would be misleading, because it is not the conditioned relationship between A and B (here: ignorance and formations) that gets elaborated upon in the following lines, but it is only the term B (here: formations), that gets defined. Hence the preferable translation: Therein what are ‘formations’, arising from ignorance as a condition?

[[#^en93|93]] [[SN12.51]] explains: *Bhikkhus*, if a person immersed in ignorance generates a meritorious volitional formation, consciousness fares on to the meritorious; if he generates a demeritorious volitional formation, consciousness fares on to the demeritorious; if he generates an imperturbable volitional formation, consciousness fares on to the imperturbable.

[[#^en94|94]] While the Pāli term *mayā* literally means made of/constructed by, it wouldn’t be correct to take this passage to mean that giving, virtue, and meditation are the causes for wholesome volition. Rather, the wholeosme volition leads to and expresses itself through giving, virtue, and meditation. Or in the words of [[DHP|DHP2]] Phenomena are preceded by the mind, surpassed by the mind, created by the mind. If one speaks or acts with a pure mind - happiness follows; just as one’s shadow that never leaves.

[[#^en95|95]] Further explained in [[SN12.25]]

[[#^en96|96]] *Manosañcetanā citta-saṅkhāro* is translated here as volition associated with the mind is the mental formation. Despite *mano* and *citta* having different shades of meaning in certain contexts, both were translated here as mind. Generally speaking *mano* refers more to the intellectual, whereas *citta* covers more the emotional/affective aspects of the mind. A detailed analysis of these terms can be found in Rune E. A. Johansson’s *Citta, Mano, Viññāṇa — a Psychosemantic Investigation*.

[[#^en97|97]] While Vibh 130 introduces a new definition for *nāma* as *vedanā-kkhandho*, *saññā-kkhandho*, *saṅkhāra-kkhandho*, this definition stands in tension with the discourses, where *nāma* is consistently defined as *vedanā*, *saññā*, *cetanā*, *phassa*, *manasikāra* (e.g. [[MN9]] [[SN12.2]]). It is for this reason that the passage from Vibh 130 was replaced with the fivefold *nāma* as found throughout the discourses.

[[#^en98|98]] The term *vāda* in *attavādupādāna* does here not necessarily refer to a doctrine of self, but rather to a person’s sense of being someone; the sense of being or having a self. This is not exactly the same as personality view, which is destroyed already at the stage of stream-entry. The lingering sense of having a self may continue for a while, despite having already intellectually and/or experientially understood that there is no self to be found in relation to the five aggregates; just as conceit (*māna*) is overcome only by the path to *Arahantship*, despite having uprooted personality view already at the stage of stream-entry.

[[#^en99|99]] Here the Vibh. differs substantially from the analysis found in the suttas. It introduces a distinction between action becoming (*kammabhava*) and rebirth becoming (*upapattibhava*). *Kammabhava* is taken to refer to wholesome, unwholesome and imperturbable actions; *upapattibhava* is taken to refer to sense/form/formless-sphere becoming, percipient/non-percipient/neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient becoming, one/four/five-component becoming. But since [[AN3.76]] says that *kamma* (together with consciousness and craving) is a condition for *bhava* (if no *kamma*...then no becoming in the sense-sphere etc. would be discerned), it is not fit to say that *kamma* itself is a form of *bhava* (*kammabhava*). However, it would go too far for the purpose of this chanting book, to discuss further implications of the analysis found in Vibh. For the sake of simplicity and emphasis on the earliest strata of the Buddha’s teachings, we substituted the passage from Vibh. with the passage from [[SN12.2]] which defines becoming (*bhava*) simply as sense/form/formless-sphere becoming. Understood in this way, becoming (*bhava*) functions as an intermediary between clinging and birth, highlighting the gradual process of how rebirth in one of the three planes of existence takes place. This can even include an interim period between death and birth; thus it is called becoming, rather than instant birth straight after death.

[[#^en100|100]] While [[SN12.2]] does not contain a full elaboration on all types of *dukkha*, a similar analysis is found in [[DN22]]

[[#^en101|101]] While [[SN12.2]] does not contain an elaboration on the different types of misfortune (*vyasana*), it is found in [[DN33]] [[AN4.192]] and [[AN5.130]] *Diṭṭhi* here does not mean just any view, but right view. The loss of other views would not be particularly unfortunate from a Buddhist perspective, especially the loss of wrong view could be regarded as a great blessing. The right view that is lost in this example is not the right view of a noble disciple, but the right view of a worldling (*puthujjana*), whose right view is not unshakeable and who may or may not change his view later on throughout the course of the present life or subsequent births.

[[#^en102|102]] Anglicising of Pāli words is quite arbitrary. For masc. and neuter we use the stem, but for fem. we use the nominative, wherefore *Gotami* (voc.) becomes *Gotamī*.

[[#^en103|103]] In *Girimānandasutta* ([[AN10.60]]) the Buddha instruced Ven. Ānanda: If, Ānanda, you visit the (severely sick) bhikkhu Girimānanda and speak to him about ten perceptions, it is possible that on hearing about them his affliction will immediately subside. Then the same seven perceptions as above are mentioned, with the addition of the following three: 8. the perception of non-delight in the entire world; 9. the perception of impermanence in all conditioned phenomena, and 10. mindfulness of breathing. *Girimānandasutta* concludes: Then, when the Venerable Ānanda had learned these ten perceptions from the Blessed One, he went to the Venerable Girimānanda and spoke to him about them. When the Venerable Girimānanda heard about these ten perceptions, his affliction immediately subsided.

[[#^en104|104]] WPN: By human strength/energy/effort; while *purisa* can also mean person, or human, in this context it probably refers to the feature of strength, which is typically associated with masculinity. A similar analogy occurs with the expression of a strong man (*purisa*) extending or contracting his arm ([[AN7.61]]).

[[#^en105|105]] WPN: omitted evil (*pāpa*) in its translation.

[[#^en106|106]] WPN: like the cream of the milk; *maṇḍapeyya* is a Pāli idiom, meaning of the best quality (lit. to be drunk like cream)

[[#^en107|107]] WPN: avaññā

[[#^en108|108]] WPN: thinking in such a way: our going forth will not be barren

[[#^en109|109]] WPN: And supports for the sick

[[#^en110|110]] WPN: sampādetun

[[#^en111|111]] WPN: Change is the nature of conditioned things

[[#^en112|112]] In the original version, this line is followed by When they act upon intention, which is not found in the Pāli, and is potentially misleading, giving the implication that intention alone is not enough to count as kamma.

[[#^en113|113]] WPN: All beings are the owners of their action and inherit its results. Their future is born from such action, companion to such action, and its results will be their home. All actions with intention, be they skilful or harmful, of such acts they will be the heirs. For the sake of consistency with other chants within this chanting book, the original version was replaced with the one found in the Five Subjects for Frequent Reflection, and Ten Subjects for Frequent Reflection.

[[#^en114|114]] The compound *sabbattatāya* (*sabba-t-tatāya*) seems to be an extension of its predecessor *sabbadhi* (everywhere), and could thus even more suitably be translated as spreading to the entire (world); *tata*: extended; spread out. (pp. of *tanoti*).

[[#^en115|115]] WPN: a heart imbued with gladness

[[#^en116|116]] WPN: For good or for ill, of that I will be the heir. For the sake of consistency with other passages which were translated differently, that translation has been chosen.

[[#^en117|117]] WPN: recollect

[[#^en118|118]] WPN: *Bhikkhus* there are ten *dhammas*

[[#^en119|119]] WPN: I am no longer living according to worldly aims and values

[[#^en120|120]] WPN: I should strive to abandon my former habits

[[#^en121|121]] WPN: Could my spiritual companions. The qualifier wise (*viññū*) has been added to the English translation, due to the important distinction between the finding fault by ordinary people, which may at times be mistaken, vs. the finding fault by the wise.

[[#^en122|122]] WPN: For good or for ill, Of that I will be the heir For the sake of consistency with other passages which were translated differently, this translation has been chosen.

[[#^en123|123]] WPN: Has my practice borne fruit with freedom or insight

[[#^en124|124]] WPN: bowels

[[#^en125|125]] WPN: entrails

[[#^en126|126]] In the discourses, except for one occasion in the Khp, the brain is not mentioned as a separate organ or body part, making it a list of only 31 body parts.

[[#^en127|127]] WPN: Everything is void of self

[[#^en128|128]] WPN: Completely void of use

[[#^en129|129]] WPN: Their nature is to rise and fall

[[#^en130|130]]The following passage is absent in the Thai edition of the *Tipiṭaka*: *Bhikkhavo**ti*; *Bhadante**ti te bhikkhū bhagavato paccassosuṁ. Bhagavā etad’avoca*.

[[#^en131|131]] The entire original version of the English translation has been replaced.

[[#^en132|132]] The following passage is absent in the Thai edition of the *Tipiṭaka*: ‘*Bhikkhus*’ – ‘Venerable sir’, they replied. The Blessed One said this:

[[#^en133|133]] *Ariyasāvaka* can be translated as noble disciple or disciple of the noble one (*ariyassa*+*sāvaka*=*ariyasāvaka*). I have opted for the first option here because the discourse addresses the group of five monks who all were *Ariyas* already at that time, but it needs to be kept in mind that the term *ariyasāvaka* does not always refer to individuals who have already attained one of the four paths or fruits. This can be seen from [[MN27]] where a person is referred to as *ariyasāvaka* without reference to any form of awakening-attainment. It is only at the end of the discourse that this *ariyasāvaka* attains awakening.

[[#^en134|134]] The word the teaching is not explicitly expressed in the Pāḷi, but was inserted for comprehension.

[[#^en135|135]] *Kataṁ karaṇīyaṁ, n’āparaṁ itthattāyā’ti* literally means What has to be done is done. There is nothing else (to so) for the sake of such a (liberated) state. For a discussion of this passage see Bhikkhu Bodhi, Middle Length Discourses, *Bhayabheravasutta*, [[MN4]] footnote 76.

[[#^en136|136]] The entire original version of the English translation has been replaced.

[[#^en137|137]] When chanted for laypeople, the first part of this chant, until here, is recited only by the *Saṅghatthera*.

[[#^en138|138]] This line is recited only by the secondmost senior monk. Afterwards, the remainder of the Saṅgha joins in.

[[#^en139|139]] In the Thai tradition, a long pause is made after *sukhaṁ*, and *balaṁ* is recited in a slow and drawn-out manner.

[[#^en140|140]] WPN: So will what’s here been given

[[#^en141|141]] WPN: Bring blessings to departed spirits

[[#^en142|142]] WPN: Through the power of all Buddhas/Dhammas/Saṅghas The phrase *Sabba-buddh’ānubhāvena*—and similarly *dhamm’ānubhāvena* and *saṅgh’ānubhāvena*—can refer to the Triple Gem in either the singular or plural. However, compounds like these do not make that distinction explicit. While the evocation of by the power of all Buddhas (past, present, and future) is plausible, it is less fitting to read *dhamm’ānubhāvena* as by the power of all dhammas (phenomena), or *saṅgh’ānubhāvena* as by the power of all communities. Therefore, the preferred reading is with all the power of the Buddha/Dhamma/Saṅgha in the singular—evoking the unique spiritual potency of the Triple Gem.

[[#^en143|143]] The first four lines were composed by Āyasmā Aggacitta, functioning as an introduction to the chant.

[[#^en144|144]] WPN: *paṭībhāna-do*

[[#^en145|145]] The Invitation to the Devas is traditionally performed as a solo introduction by the thirdmost senior monk. However, any monk who has been invited by the *Saṅghatthera* can do so.

[[#^en146|146]] When chanted for laypeople, only the second line (*Dhamma-ssavana kālo*...) is recited, which is repeated three times.

[[#^en147|147]] WPN: *Payirūpāsana*. *Pari* + *upa* = *payirupa*

[[#^en148|148]] WPN: *Osathaṁ*. *Osatha* is not a word found in Pāli dictionaries, but *osadha* (medicine) is. The spelling *osatha* is due to a faulty transliteration, influenced by Thai style of Pāli pronunciation, where d often becomes t. The *Mahā-jaya-maṅgala-gāthā* was originally composed in Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan version indeed speaks of *osadha*, thus confirming above explanation for the spelling error.

[[#^en149|149]] WPN: *devānumodantu*

[[#^en150|150]] Here and in all subsequent verses we find the word *jitavā*. The standard spelling would be *jitvā* (abs. of *jināti*; having conquered). In contrast *jitavā* is a transliteration based on Thai spelling and pronunciation of Pāli, which has a tendency to insert the letter a between two consonants such as -*tvā*, thus making it into -*tavā*. It is by spelling anomalies like this, that Pāli scholars can determine the place of origin and age of certain Pāli texts.

[[#^en151|151]] WPN: *paṇidhi* and *padakkhiṇā*

[[#^en152|152]] WPN: Through the power of all Buddhas/Dhammas/Saṅghas The phrase *Sabba-buddh’ānubhāvena*—and similarly *dhamm’ānubhāvena* and *saṅgh’ānubhāvena*—can refer to the Triple Gem in either the singular or plural. However, compounds like these do not make that distinction explicit. While the evocation of by the power of all Buddhas (past, present, and future) is plausible, it is less fitting to read *dhamm’ānubhāvena* as by the power of all dhammas (phenomena), or *saṅgh’ānubhāvena* as by the power of all communities. Therefore, the preferred reading is with all the power of the Buddha/Dhamma/Saṅgha in the singular—evoking the unique spiritual potency of the Triple Gem.

[[#^en153|153]] While these faculties are mentioned as a set of 22 only in the Abhidhamma Vibhaṅga, all of them are also found within the discourses.

[[#^en154|154]] WPN: Their nature is to rise and fall

[[#^en155|155]] While the celestial bodies themselves are not regarded as living beings, this passage refers to the similarly named young devas (*candimā*/*sūriyo devaputto*) residing there. See also [[SN2.9-10]] Furthermore, the term *rājā* (leaders/kings) does not refer to *guṅavantā* (virtuous people), but to *suriyo candima* (sun and moon). A translation closer to the meaning of the Pāli would be: The sovereign Sun and Moon, and also virtuous people.

[[#^en156|156]] This probably refers to 1. worldly or human happiness; 2. celestial or heavenly happiness; 3. transcendent happiness or *Nibbāna*. Rhys Davids Pāli-English Dictionary - *sukha*: Two kinds, viz *kāyika* & *cetasika*; at Pts.i.188; several other pairs at AN.i.80; three (praise, wealth, heaven) [[ITI67]] another three (*manussa*°, *dibba*°, *Nibbāna*°) Dhp-a.iii.51; four (possessing, making good use of possessions, having no debts, living a blameless life) AN.ii.69

[[#^en157|157]] The Pāli speaks about *Māra’s* forces.

[[#^en158|158]] Even though a *Paccekabuddha* does not (or is not able to) teach the path to *Nibbāna*, he can nonetheless give guidance in good conduct and virtue; functioning as an inspirational role model.

[[#^en159|159]] Darkness and delusion is not a literal translation for Māra.

[[#^en160|160]] The Thai tradition recites *Ahaṁ bhante tisaraṇena saha pañca/aṭṭha sīlāni yācāmi* three times which translates to I, venerable sir, request the Three Refuges and the Five/Eight Precepts before Namo tassa...

[[#^en161|161]] WPN: precept. The same applies to the next four lines.

[[#^en162|162]] WPN: drugs which lead to carelessness

[[#^en163|163]] WPN: which

[[#^en164|164]] WPN: at inappropriate times

[[#^en165|165]] WPN: entertainment, beautification, and adornment

[[#^en166|166]] WPN: These are the Eight Precepts; Virtue is the source of happiness, Virtue is the source of true wealth, Virtue is the source of peacefulness. Therefore let virtue be purified

## Preface

This book is an exhaustive survey of the Buddha’s exhortations from the Pali Canon addressed in the form “thus ... should you train yourselves” (*evañhi vo ... sikkhitabbaṃ*). The passages are organized by theme and roughly follow the gradual path taught in the Mahā-Assapurasutta ([[MN39]]). In addition to outlining a gradual course, this sutta is one of the primary sources for this type of injunction.

The Buddha used this form of address when speaking to many different people, tailoring each teaching to the capacities of his listeners and the circumstances of culture. One instance of this specificity is the training advice given to the soon-to-be-married daughters of Uggaha ([[AN5.33]]). These instructions, which exemplify the monastic virtue of hospitality (*paṭisanthāra*), along with others given to very specific audiences, have been included for completeness.

The English translations are an attempted balance of literalness, ease of chanting, and, where applicable, accord with the chanting books of the Western Forest Sangha. The the translations of Ṭhānissaro Bhikkhu and Bhikkhu Bodhi were consulted frequently with gratitude.

To create a sense of cohesiveness echoing the conclusion of the
Bhikkhu Pātimokkha, the postscript “The Exposition of That Which Is to be Trained In is finished” (*sikkhitabbuddesa niṭṭhitaṃ*) has been added.

This work was made possible by the Digital Pali Reader and the support of the Abhayagiri community.

Anumodanā!
May all beings be happy.

## *Pabbajjā*Going-Forth

*“samaṇā samaṇā”ti vo, bhikkhave, jano sañjānāti. tumhe ca pana “ke tumhe”ti puṭṭhā samānā “samaṇāmhā”ti paṭijānātha; tesaṃ vo, bhikkhave, evaṃsamaññānaṃ sataṃ evaṃpaṭiññānaṃ sataṃ “ye dhammā samaṇakaraṇā ca brāhmaṇakaraṇā ca te dhamme samādāya vattissāma, (yā samaṇasāmīcipaṭipadā taṃ paṭipajjissāma) evaṃ no ayaṃ amhākaṃ samaññā ca saccā bhavissati paṭiññā ca bhūtā. yesañca mayaṃ cīvarapiṇḍapātasenāsanagilānappaccayabhesajjaparikkhāraṃ paribhuñjāma, tesaṃ te kārā amhesu mahapphalā bhavissanti mahānisaṃsā, amhākañcevāyaṃ pabbajjā avañjhā bhavissati saphalā saudrayā”ti. evañhi vo, bhikkhave, sikkhitabbaṃ.*

“*Samaṇas*, *samaṇas*,” bhikkhus, that is how people perceive you. And when asked, “What are you?” you claim, “We are *samaṇas*.” So, with this being your designation and this your claim, [you should think:] “We will undertake and practice those qualities that make one a *samaṇa*, that make one a brahman, (we will practice the way of the *samaṇa* with integrity) so that our designations will be true and our claims accurate; so that the services of those whose robes, alms-food, lodging, and medicinal requisites we use will bring them great fruit and great benefit; and so that our going forth will not be barren, but fruitful and fertile.” Thus, bhikkhus, should you train yourselves.

[[MN39]] [[MN40]] [[SN12.22]] [[AN7.72]]

*“yathāpabbajjāparicitañca no cittaṃ bhavissati, na cuppannā pāpakā akusalā dhammā cittaṃ pariyādāya ṭhassanti, aniccasaññāparicitañca no cittaṃ bhavissati, anattasaññāparicitañca no cittaṃ bhavissati, asubhasaññāparicitañca no cittaṃ bhavissati, ādīnavasaññāparicitañca no cittaṃ bhavissati, lokassa samañca visamañca ñatvā taṃsaññāparicitañca no cittaṃ bhavissati, lokassa bhavañca vibhavañca ñatvā taṃsaññāparicitañca no cittaṃ bhavissati, lokassa samudayañca atthaṅgamañca ñatvā taṃsaññāparicitañca no cittaṃ bhavissati, pahānasaññāparicitañca no cittaṃ bhavissati, virāgasaññāparicitañca no cittaṃ bhavissati, nirodhasaññāparicitañca no cittaṃ bhavissatī”ti. evañhi vo, bhikkhave, sikkhitabbaṃ.*

“Our minds will be thoroughly ingrained with the spirit of our going-forth; hence, arisen evil, unskillful states will not overpower the mind. Our minds will be thoroughly ingrained with the perception of impermanence. Our minds will be thoroughly ingrained with the perception of not-self. Our minds will be thoroughly ingrained with the perception of the unbeautiful. Our minds will be thoroughly ingrained with the perception of drawbacks. Knowing the even and the uneven ways of the world, our minds will be thoroughly ingrained with that perception. Knowing the becoming and non-becoming of the world, our minds will be thoroughly ingrained with that perception. Knowing the arising and the passing away of the world, our minds will be thoroughly ingrained with that perception. Our minds will be thoroughly ingrained with the perception of abandoning. Our minds will be thoroughly ingrained with the perception of dispassion. Our minds will be thoroughly ingrained with the perception of cessation.” Thus, bhikkhus, should you train yourselves.

[[AN10.59]]

These are the Blessed One’s disciples. Such ones are worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of respect.

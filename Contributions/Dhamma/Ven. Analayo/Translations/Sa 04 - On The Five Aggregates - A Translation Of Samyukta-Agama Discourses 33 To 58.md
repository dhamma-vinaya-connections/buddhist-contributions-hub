       - Date of submission: 2013/12/01; date of review: 2014/03/02.
I am indebted to sāmaṇeri Dhammadinnā, bhikṣu Kongmu, bhikṣuṇī Syinchen, and
Ken Su for their collaboration and to the journal's proof readers for helpful suggestions.

1 The translated section comprises the second fascicle of the Taishō edition of the _Saṃ_             _yukta-āgama_, T II 7b22 to 15b1, corresponding to the fourth part of the section on the
aggregates according to the reconstructed order of this collection _._ My identification
of Pāli parallels is based on Akanuma 1929/1990 and Yìnshùn 1983, in the case of
Sanskrit fragment parallels I am indebted to Chung 2008; Tibetan parallels in Śamathadeva's compendium of discourse quotations from the _Abhidharmakośabhāṣya_ have
been identified by Honjō 1984 and are translated by Dhammadinnā 2014, who in her
footnotes covers variations found in the Tibetan parallels. Here and elsewhere, I adopt
Pāli for proper names and doctrinal terms in order to facilitate comparison with the
Pāli parallels, except for terms like Dharma and Nirvāṇa, without thereby intending
to take a position on the original language of the _Saṃyukta-āgama_ manuscript used
for translation. In the case of reproducing Sanskrit texts from romanized editions, I
follow the conventions of the respective editors (except for capitalization). For discourses 33 to 36 my reconstruction of the respective titles is based on the _uddāna_
found after discourse 36. In case the same title applies to more than one discourse, I
have added "first", "second", etc., to the title, which is without support in the respective _uddāna_ [[SN2]] 法鼓佛學學報第 14 期（2014）

# 33. [Discourse on Not-self] [2]

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, Anāthapindika's Park.


At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: "Bodily form is not
self. If bodily form were the self, then it should not happen that disease and pain arise in relation to bodily form, and there should not be
the wish for bodily form to be in this way and not to be in that way.
Because bodily form is not self, there is the arising of disease and pain
in relation to bodily form and one gets the wish for bodily form to be
in this way and not to be in that way. Feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness _is also like this._


"Monks, what do you think, is bodily form permanent or impermanent?"


The monks said to the Buddha: "It is impermanent, Blessed One."


[The Buddha said]: "Monks, what is impermanent, is it _dukkha_ ?"


The monks said to the Buddha: "It is _dukkha_, Blessed One." [7c]


[The Buddha said]: "What is impermanent, _dukkha_, of a nature to
change, would a learned noble disciple herein regard it as the self, as
distinct from the self [in the sense of being owned by it], as existing

[within the self, or the self] as existing [within it]?"


The monks said to the Buddha: "No, Blessed One."


[The Buddha said]: "Feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness _is_ _also_ _like_ _this_ . Therefore, monks, whatever bodily form, whether
past, future or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, sublime or
repugnant, far or near, all of it is not self, is not distinct from the self

[in the sense of being owned by it], does not exist [within the self, nor


2 This discourse, of which no parallels are known, is similar to the next discourse, [[SA34]] except for the location and audience of the discourse, and for some minor difference in formulation. Due to the different audience, it also does not have the indication
in [[SA34]] that the five monks were liberated on hearing this instruction.

does a self] exist [within it]. In this way it should be examined. Feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness _is also like this._


"Monks, a learned noble disciple examines these five aggregates of
clinging as they really are as not self and not belonging to a self. Having examined them as they really are, he does not cling to anything in
the whole world. Because of not clinging to anything, he is not attached
to anything. Because of not being attached to anything, he personally
realizes Nirvāṇa, [knowing]: 'Birth for me has been eradicated, the
holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, I
myself know that there will be no receiving of further existence.'"


When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, the monks, hearing what
the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.

# 34. [Discourse to the Five] [3]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Vārāṇasī in
the Deer Park at Isipatana.

At that time the Blessed One said to remaining [four] [4] of the five
monks: [5] "Bodily form is not self. If bodily form were the self, then it

Chung 2008: 60 note 47), 144 and 145. A comprehensive survey of the parallel versions would require an article on its own, hence in what follows I confine myself to
providing the reconstruction of the corresponding Sanskrit passages from Waldschmidt's edition of the _Catuṣpariṣat-sūtra._ A more detailed comparison will be provided in Allon (forthcoming).

4 According to the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition's account of the beginnings of the Buddha's teaching activities, Kondañña had already become an arahant previously; cf.
Waldschmidt 1951/1967: 180. With the present instruction the other four of the five
will reach the same.

should not happen that disease and pain arise in relation to bodily
form, and one should not get the wish for bodily form to be in this
way and not to be in that way. [6] Because bodily form is not self, there
is the arising of disease and pain in relation to bodily form and one gets
the wish for bodily form to be in this way and not to be in that way. [7]
Feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness _is also like this_ . [8]


"Monks, what do you think, is bodily form permanent or impermanent?"

The monks said to the Buddha: "It is impermanent, Blessed One." [9]


[The Buddha said]: "Monks, what is impermanent, is it _dukkha_ ?"


_āmantrayate_ ).

6 Waldschmidt 1957: 162 (15.2): _(rūpaṃ bh)ikṣavo 'nātmā, rūpañ ced ā(tmābhaviṣyad_
_rūpaṃ na vyābādhāya duḥkhāya saṃvarteta labhyeta ca rūpa)sya, evaṃ me rūpaṃ_
_bhava(tv evaṃ mā bhūd iti)_ . [[SN22.59]] at SN III 66,27 has a closely corresponding
formulation, indicating that if bodily form were the self, "one would be able to have it
of bodily form: Let my bodily form be like this; let my bodily form not be like that,"
_labbhetha ca rūpe: evaṃ me rūpaṃ hotu, evaṃ me rūpaṃ mā ahosī ti_ . While Kuan
2009: 169 finds a substantial difference between the formulations in [[SN22.59]] and
[[SA34]] it seems to be that both point to the same issue, namely the lack of control
over the respective aggregate; cf. also the corresponding passage in the _Mahāvastu_,
Senart 1897: 335,14, which reads: _ṛdhyāc ca rūpe kāmakārikatā evaṃ me rūpaṃ bha_         _vatu evaṃ mā bhavatu_ . In view of the similarity between the _Catuṣpariṣat-sūtra_ fragments and [[SN22.59]] differences in [[SA34]] stand good chances of being the result of
the translation and need not be reflecting a substantially different conception of the
teaching of not self. Thus I take it that the main point in all these versions would be to
highlight the aggregate's failure to be amenable to the full exercise of control, this in
turn being an intrinsic requirement for a self. According to the standard descriptions
of _sakkāyadiṭṭhi_, such a self conception can be construed in relation to each aggregate
in different ways: a) by considering the aggregate to correspond to the self, b) by taking the self to be endowed with the aggregate, c) by presuming the aggregate to be
part of the self, d) by taking the self to be within the aggregate; cf. Anālayo 2010b: 47
note 21. For a reply to Kuan 2009 cf. also Adam 2010/2011: 246f note 13.

7 Waldschmidt 1957: 164 (15.3): _(yasmāt tarhi rūpam anātmā tasmād rūpaṃ vyābā_       _dhāya duḥkhāya saṃvartate na) ca labhyate rūpa(sya, evaṃ me rūpaṃ bhavatv evaṃ_
_mā bhūd iti)_ .

The monks said to the Buddha: "It is _dukkha_, Blessed One." [10]


[The Buddha said]: "Monks, what is impermanent, _dukkha_, of a nature
to change, would a learned noble disciple herein regard it as the self,
as distinct from the self [in the sense of being owned by it], as existing

[within the self, or the self] as existing [within it]?" [11]

The monks said to the Buddha: "No, Blessed One." [12]


[The Buddha said]: "Feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness
_is also like this_ . [13]


"Therefore, monks, whatever bodily form, whether past, future or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, sublime or repugnant, far or
near, all of it is not self and does not belong to a self. In this way it
should be examined as it really is. [14] Feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness _is also like this._ [15]

12 Waldschmidt 1957: 166 (15.9): _no bhadanta_ .

13 Waldschmidt 1957: 166 (15.10): _evaṃ vedanā saṃjñā saṃskārā vijñānaṃ nit(y)am_
_(anityaṃ vā_ ); followed by giving the full exposition again for the case of consciousness.

14 Waldschmidt 1957: 168 (15.16): _(ta)smāt tarhi bhikṣavo yat kiñcid rūpam atītānāg_ _atapratyu(tpannam ādhyātmikaṃ vā bahirdhā vaudārikaṃ vā sūkṣmaṃ vā hīnaṃ vā_
_praṇītaṃ vā ya)d vā dūre yat vāntike tat sarva(ṃ) naitan mama, naiṣo 'ham (a)smi,_
_naiṣa ma ātme(ti, evam etad yathābhūtaṃ samyakprajñayā draṣṭavyam)_ . The statement that all bodily form as well as all of the other aggregates are not self is missing
from the Gāndhārī fragment parallel; cf. Allon (forthcoming).

15 Waldschmidt 1957: 168 (15.17): _(evaṃ) yā kācid vedanā yā kācit saṃjñā ye kecit_
_saṃskārā yat kiñ(cid vijñānam_ ); followed by giving the full exposition again for the

tached to anything, he personally realizes Nirvāṇa, [8a] [knowing]:
'Birth for me has been eradicated, the holy life has been established,
what had to be done has been done, I myself know that there will be
no receiving of further existence.'" [16]


When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, by not clinging the remaining [four] of the five monks attained liberation from the influxes
in their minds. [17] When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, the
monks, hearing what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully. [18]

# 35. [Discourse to the Three]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying among the
Cetis in the [Eastern] Bamboo Grove Dwelling.


At that time there were three worthy ones who had recently gone forth,
namely the venerable Anuruddha, the venerable Nanda, and the venerable Kimbila.


At that time the Blessed One, knowing the thoughts in their minds, admonished them: "Monks, this mind, this mentality, this consciousness
should think this and should not think that. Abandon this sensual desire, abandon this bodily form, and dwell being completely established


16 Waldschmidt 1957: 170 (15.18): _yataś ca bhikṣa(vaḥ śrutavān āryaśrāvakaḥ pañco_        _padānaskandhān naiṣo 'haṃ naiṣo mama samanupaśyaty evam eva samanupaśyan_
_na kiñcid loka upādatte, nopā)dadāno na paritasyate ('paritasyan pratyātmam eva_
_parinirvāti, kṣīṇā me jātir uṣitaṃ brahmacaryaṃ kṛtaṃ karaṇīyaṃ nāparam asmād_
_bhāvam iti prajānāti)_ . Progress towards Nirvāṇa in [[SN22.59]] at SN III 68,20 leads
from seeing the aggregates as they really are to becoming disenchanted, _nibbindati_,
becoming dispassionate, _virajjati_, and becoming liberated, _vimuccati._

17 Waldschmidt 1957: 170 (15.19): _(a)smin khalu dha(r)maparyā(ye bhāṣyamāṇe 'va_        _śiṣṭānāṃ pañcakānāṃ bhikṣūṇāṃ anupādāyāsravebhyaś cittaṃ vimuktam)._ The Sanskrit parallel indicates that the expression 不起 in the phrase 不起諸漏心得解脫 in
[[SA35]] would render _anupādāya_ .

18 [[SN22.59]] at SN III 68,26 first notes that the five monks delighted in the Buddha's discourse and then reports that during its delivery they attained liberation from the influxes.

in its direct realization. Monks, would there be a bodily form that is
permanent and unchanging, which firmly remains?"


The monks said to the Buddha: "No, Blessed One."


The Buddha said to the monks: "It is well, it is well. Bodily form is
impermanent and of a nature to change, it is to become disenchanted
with, it fades away, ceases, become appeased, and disappears. In this
way bodily form, since its beginning, is entirely impermanent, _dukkha_,
and of a nature to change.


"Having understood it in this way, all the harmful influxes, burning,
and worry, which in dependence on that bodily form arise, will be
abandoned and eradicated completely. Having been abandoned and
eradicated, one is no attached to anything. Not being attached to anything, one is established in peace. Being established in peace, one attains Nirvāṇa. Feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness _is_
_also like this._


When the Buddha spoke this discourse, by not clinging the three worthy ones attained liberation from the influxes in their mind. When the
Buddha had spoken this discourse, the monks, hearing what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.

# 36. [Discourse to Sixteen] [19]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying in the Madhurā country, in the Parasol Mango Tree Grove by the side of the
river *Bhaddikā. [20]


At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: "Dwell with yourself

below by Dhammadinnā 2014: 76f.

20 [[SN22.43]] at SN III 42,6 instead mentions Sāvatthī as the location. The location of the
present discourse recurs in [[SA639]] at T II 177a15, parallel to [[SN47.14]] which at SN
V 163,24 gives the location as Ukkacelā on the bank of the river Ganges.

as your island, dwell by relying on yourself; dwell with the Dharma as
your island, dwell by relying on the Dharma, having no other island
and no other reliance.


"Monks, dwelling with yourself as your island and relying on yourself,
with the Dharma as your island and relying on the Dharma, having no
other island and no other reliance, you should properly examine this:
'What causes the arising of worry, sorrow, vexation, and _dukkha_ ? Why
do these four exist? [21] What is their cause? Where am I bound by attachment?'


"How does one examine oneself regarding the arising of not yet arisen
worry, sorrow, vexation, and _dukkha_, and the growing and increase of
already arisen worry, sorrow, vexation, and _dukkha_ ?"


The monks said to the Buddha: "The Blessed One is the root of the
Dharma, the eye of the Dharma, and the foundation of the Dharma.
May he explain it. Having heard it, the monks will receive it respectfully as it was said." [22]


The Buddha said to the monks: [8b] "Listen and pay careful attention
to what I shall tell you. Monks, one examines oneself: with the existence of bodily form, in dependence on bodily form, and being bound
by attachment to bodily form, not yet arisen worry, sorrow, vexation,
and _dukkha_ arise, and already arisen [worry, sorrow, vexation, and
_dukkha_ ] grow further and increase. Feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness _is also like this_ . Monks, is there a bodily form
that is permanent, lasting, and unchanging, that firmly remains?"

They replied: "No, Blessed One." [23]


21 Yìnshùn 1983: 143 note 3 suggests to emend 四 to read 因, on following which the
present inquiry would not explicitly refer to "four".

22 [[SN22.43]] does not report a request by the monks and instead continues with the Buddha describing the predicament of the unlearned worldling who in four alternative
modes (see above note 6) regards each aggregate as a self and then is afflicted by its
change.

23 Here, too, instead of a question and answer exchange, [[SN22.43]] continues with the
Buddha expounding the topic.


10 法鼓佛學學報第 14 期（2014）


The Buddha said to the monks: "It is well, it is well, monks. Bodily
form is impermanent. If a clansman has understood that bodily form is
impermanent, [24] [of a nature] to change, to fade away, to cease, to be
appeased, and to disappear; on having known that bodily form since
its beginning is entirely impermanent, _dukkha_, and of a nature to
change, then the worry, sorrow, vexation, and _dukkha_ that arise in dependence on bodily form are abandoned. Having abandoned them, one
is not attached to anything. Because of not being attached, one is happily established in peace. Being happily established in peace is called
being quenched. [25] Feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness _is also like this_ .


When the Buddha spoke this discourse, by not giving rise to [clinging]
sixteen monks attained liberation from the influxes in their mind. [26]
When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, the monks, hearing what
the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.

# 37. [Discourse on [What the Unwise Take to Be] the Self] [27]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.


24 The CBETA editors emend 已 to 苦, in line with the reading found in the next part
of the exposition. This suggestion is not supported by [[SN22.43]] at SN III 43,4, which
(taking the case of the first aggregate) just reads _aniccataṃ viditvā vipariṇāmaṃ_ (C [e] :
_vipariṇāma_ ), but then continues with _aniccaṃ dukkhaṃ vipariṇāmadhamman ti_ (E [e] :
_viparināma°_ ); cf. also Yìnshùn 1983: 141, who does not emend 已.

25 According to [[SN22.43]] at SN III 43,10, such a monk is reckoned to be "quenched in
that respect", _tadaṅganibbuto._

26 [[SN22.43]] does not report any realizations.

27 Parallels: [[SN22.94]] at SN III 138,25; a Gāndhārī fragment parallel, described by
Allon in Glass 2007: 16 (I am indebted to Mark Allon for sharing with me information on the as yet unpublished fragment and his discussion of it in the light of its parallels); and a quote in the _Prasannapadā_, La Vallée Poussin 1903/1970: 370,6. For
discourses 37 to 46 my reconstruction of the respective titles is based on the _uddāna_
found after discourse 46.


On the Five Aggregates (4)－A Translation of
_Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 33 to 58 11


At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: "I do not dispute with
the world; the world disputes with me. [28] Why is that? Monks, if one
speaks according to the Dharma, one does not dispute with the world.
What the wise in the world declare to exist, I also declare to exist. [29]
What do the wise in the world declare to exist, which I also declare to
exist?


"Monks, bodily form is impermanent, _dukkha_, and of a nature to
change. The wise in the world declare this exists, and I also declare
this exists. _In the same way_ feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness is impermanent, _dukkha_, and of a nature to change. The
wise in the world declare this exists, and I also declare this exists. [30]


"What the wise in the world declare not to exist, I also declare not to
exist. That is, bodily form that is permanent, lasting, and unchanging,
that firmly remains; the wise in the world declare that this does not
exist, and I also declare that this does not exist. Feeling ... perception ...
formations ... consciousness that is permanent, lasting, and unchanging, that firmly remains; the wise in the world declare this does not
exist, and I also declare this does not exist. This is called what the wise in
the world declare not to exist, which I also declare not to exist.


"Monks, there is a worldly phenomenon in the world which I have also
myself understood and myself realized, and which I analyse, explain,
and disclose to people. Those in the world who are blind and without
vision do not understand and do not see this, but this is not my fault.


"Monks, what is the worldly phenomenon in the world that I have myself understood, myself realized, [8c] which I explain, analyse, and
disclose to people, and which those who are blind and without vision


28 La Vallée Poussin 1903/1970: 370,6: _loko mayā sārdhiṃ vivadati nāhaṃ lokena sār_        _dhiṃ vivadāmi._

30 [[SN22.94]] and the Gāndhārī fragment parallel adopt the opposite sequence, as they
first cover the non-existence of a permanent bodily form, etc., before taking up the
existence of impermanent bodily form, etc.

do not understand and see?

"Monks, [31] bodily form is impermanent, _dukkha_, and of a nature to
change. [32] This is called a worldly phenomenon in the world. _In the_
_same way_ feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness is impermanent, _dukkha_, [and of a nature to change]. [33] This is a worldly
phenomenon in the world.


"Monks, this is the worldly phenomenon in the world that I have
myself understood and myself realized, which I analyse, explain, and
disclose to people, and which those who are blind and without vision
do not understand and do not see. What can I do about those who are
blind and without vision, who do not understand and do not see?" [34]


When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, the monks, hearing what
the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.

# 38. [Discourse on What is Lowly]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.


At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: "People in the world
through lowly activities seek in various way for wealth and a livelihood, and for becoming immensely rich. People in the world know
about all this.


"As it is known to people in the world, I also speak in this way. Why
is that? May I not be apart from the people in the world.

# 39. [Discourse on Seeds] [37]

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.


At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: "There are five types
of seeds. What are the five? [38] That is, there are root-seeds, stem-seeds,
joint-seeds, seeds falling off on their own, and fruit seeds. [39] [If] these
five types of seeds are not broken, not spoiled, not rotten, not [carried
away] by the wind, [9a] [if] they are new, mature, and solid, [40] and
there is the earth element, but not the water element, then those seeds
will not grow and flourish. [41]


"If those seeds are new, mature, solid, not broken, not spoiled, [not
rotten], [42] not [carried away] by the wind, and there is the water element, but not the earth element, then those seeds will also not grow
and flourish. If those seeds are new, mature, solid, not broken, not
spoiled, not rotten, not [carried away] by the wind, and there are the
earth and the water elements, then those seeds will grow and flour

41 [[SN22.54]] at SN III 54,10 begins with the case that there is neither earth nor water,
followed by the possibility that there is earth and water but the seeds are damaged
and not well planted, and then has the case that there is earth and water and the seeds
are well planted. Another difference is that [[SN22.54]] works through these cases by
way of a question and answer exchange between the Buddha and the monks.

"Monks, those five seeds are a simile for consciousness being conjoined with the aggregates of clinging; [44] the earth element is a simile
for the four establishments of consciousness; [45] the water element is a
simile for lustful delight in the four [aggregates of] clinging as a basis
for the establishment of consciousness. What are the four? Being established in bodily form, with bodily form as its basis, and moistened
by lustful delight, consciousness will grow and flourish. Being established in feeling ... perception ... formations ... based on feeling ... perception ... formations, and moistened by lustful delight, consciousness
will grow and flourish. Monks, it is herein that consciousness comes,
goes, stands, departs, grows, and flourishes.


"Monks, suppose separate from bodily form, feeling, perception, and
formations, there were consciousness that would come, go, stand, [depart], grow [and flourish]. Even though someone may say so repeatedly, on being questioned about it he will not know and give rise to
ever more bewilderment, because this is outside the sphere of his experience.

bodily form is abandoned. [46] The bondage that arises in the mind by
engaging with bodily form being abandoned, the basis is abandoned.
The basis being abandoned, [that] consciousness is not established
anywhere and does not grow further and increase. On being free from
lust for the feeling ... perception ... formations element, having become
free from lust, the bondage that arises in the mind by engaging with
formations is abandoned. [47] The bondage that arises in the mind by
engaging with formations being abandoned, the basis is abandoned.
The basis being abandoned, that consciousness is not established anywhere and does not grow further and increase.


"Because of not growing, there is no creating of formations. Not creating formations, one is steady. Being steady, one is contented. Being
contented, one is released. Being released, one does not grasp at anything in the whole world and is not attached to anything. Not grasping
at anything and not being attached to anything one personally realizes
Nirvāṇa, [knowing]: 'Birth for me has been eradicated, the holy life
has been established, what had to be done has been done, I myself
know that there will be no receiving of further existence.' [48]


"I say that consciousness does not proceed to the east, the west, the
south, the north, the four intermediate [directions], above, below, it
does not proceed to anywhere. One just sees the Dharma and wishes
to enter Nirvāṇa, which is peaceful, cool, pure, and true."


When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, the monks, hearing what
the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.


46 My translation of the expression 封滯 in [[SA39]] at T II 9a14 and 9a17 as "engaging
with" is based on the next discourse, where it clearly functions as the counterpart to
_upāya_ in the parallel [[SN22.53]]

47 Here and in the next sentence I follow the emendation by Yìnshùn 1983: 149 note 2
of 觸 to read 縛, in line with the formulation used previously in [[SA39]] for bodily
form.

48 [[SN22.54]] concludes at this point and thus has no counterpart to the remaining part of

Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.


At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: "There are five aggregates of clinging, the bodily form aggregate of clinging, the feeling ...
perception ... formations ... consciousness aggregate of clinging. In five
modes I understand these five aggregates of clinging as they really
are: [54] I understand bodily form as it really is, I understand the arising
of bodily form ... the gratification in bodily form ... the danger in bodily
form ... the escape from bodily form as it really is. _In the same way_ I
understand feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness as it
really is, understand the arising of consciousness ... the gratification in
consciousness ... the danger in consciousness ... the escape from consciousness as it really is. [55]


"How does one understand bodily form as it really is? Whatever bodily
form, all of it is the four elements and the form that is made out of the
four elements – this is called bodily form. In this way one understands
bodily form as it really is.


"How does one understand the arising of bodily form as it really is?
Delight and craving for bodily form - this is called the arising of bodily
form. [56] In this way one understands the arising of bodily form as it
really is.


"How does one understand the gratification in bodily form as it really
is? That is, the delight and joy that arise in dependence on bodily form –
this is called the gratification in bodily form. In this way one understands the gratification in bodily form as it really is.


"How does one understand the danger in bodily form as it really is?
That bodily form is impermanent, _dukkha_, and of a nature to change –


54 [[SN22.56]] at [[SN59.4]] instead adopts a fourfold turning (following the pattern of the
four noble truths): the aggregate, its arising, its cessation, and the path leading to its
cessation.

55 According to [[SN22.56]] at SN III 59,3, the Buddha did not claim to have reached full
awakening until he had gained such full understanding of the five aggregates of
clinging.

56 [[SN22.56]] at [[SN59.21]] instead relates the arising of bodily form to nutriment ( _āhāra_ ).

this is called the danger in bodily form. In this way one understands
the danger in bodily form as it really is.


"How does one understand the escape from bodily form as it really is?
If one disciplines lustful desire, abandons lustful desire, and goes beyond lustful desire for bodily form     - this is called the escape from bodily
form. In this way one understands the escape from bodily form as it
really is.


"How does one understand feeling as it really is? There are six classes
of feeling: feeling arisen from eye-contact ... ear-[contact] ... nose-[contact] ... tongue-[contact] ... body-[contact] ... and feeling arisen from
mind-contact – this is called feeling. In this way one understands feeling as it really is.


"How does one understand the arising of feeling as it really is? With
the arising of contact, feeling arises – [this is called the arising of feeling]. In this way one understands the arising of feeling as it really is.


"How does one understand the gratification in feeling as it really is?
The delight and joy that arise in dependence on the six feelings – this
is called the gratification in feeling. In this way one understands the
gratification in feeling as it really is.


"How does one understand the danger in feeling as it really is? That
feeling is impermanent, _dukkha_, and of a nature to change – this is
called the danger in feeling. In this way one understands the danger in
feeling as it really is.

disciplining of lustful desire, the abandoning of lustful desire, and the
going beyond lustful desire for feeling – this is called the escape from
feeling. In this way one understands the escape from feeling as it
really is.


"How does one understand perception as it really is? That is, [one understands] the six classes of perception. What are the six? That is, perception arisen from eye-contact ... ear-[contact] ... nose-[contact] ...
tongue-[contact] ... body-[contact] ... and perception arisen from mindcontact. This is called perception. [9c] In this way one understands
perception as it really is.

58 A comparable description occurs in [[SN22.56]] after each aggregate. Instead of concluding with a reference to the end of _dukkha_, [[SN22.56]] (e.g., SN III 59,35) points
out that no round can be designated for them, _vaṭṭaṃ tesaṃ n'atthi paññāpanāya_ ; for

"How is there the giving rise to and being bound by attachment? Because a foolish unlearned worldling does not understand as it really is
the arising of bodily form, the cessation of bodily form, the gratification in bodily form, the danger in bodily form, and the escape from
bodily form, [85] he delights in bodily form with craving, commends it,
and clings to it with attachment. He clings to bodily form as the self

hunger, thirst, and by contact with flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and serpents.

true nature.

_Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 33 to 58 37


"All perceptions are the perception aggregate of clinging. What is being
perceived? There are few perceptions, many perceptions, immeasurable perceptions, [or] in relation to the totality of nothingness one has
the perception of nothingness. [100] Because it has [the characteristic of
perceiving], it is called the perception aggregate of clinging. Again,
this perception aggregate of clinging is impermanent, _dukkha_, and of a
nature to change.


"What has the characteristic of being constructed is the formations
aggregate of clinging. What is being constructed? Bodily form is being
constructed ... feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness is
being constructed. Because it has the characteristic of being constructed,
it is [called] the formations aggregate of clinging. [101] Again, this formations aggregate of clinging is impermanent, _dukkha_, and of a nature to
change.


"What has the characteristic of discerning is the consciousness aggregate of clinging. What is being cognized? Forms are cognized ...
sounds ... odours ... flavours ... tangibles ... mental objects are cognized. Because it has [the characteristic of discerning] it is called the
consciousness aggregate of clinging. [102] Again, this consciousness
aggregate of clinging is impermanent, _dukkha_, and of a nature to
change.


"Monks, the learned noble disciple trains in regard to the bodily form
aggregate of clinging in this way: 'Now I am being consumed by present bodily form. In the past I have already been consumed by bodily
form, just as now by the present one.'


"He further reflects: 'Being now [already] consumed by present bodily
form, if I continue to delight with attachment in future bodily form, I
will further be consumed by that bodily form, just as now by the pre

sent one.' Having understood it in this way, he is not concerned with
past bodily form, does not delight with attachment in future bodily
form, and gives rise to disenchantment in relation to present bodily
form, to dispassion and cessation, and proceeds towards its cessation. [103]


"A learned noble disciple trains in regard to this feeling ... perception ...
formations ... consciousness aggregate of clinging [in this way]: 'Now
I am being consumed by present consciousness. In the past I have
already been consumed by consciousness, just as now by the present
one. Being now already consumed by present consciousness, if I continue to delight with attachment in future consciousness, I will further
be consumed by that consciousness, just as now by the present one.'


"Having understood it in this way, he is not concerned with past consciousness, does not delight [with attachment] in future consciousness,
and gives rise to disenchantment in relation to present consciousness,
to dispassion and cessation, and proceeds towards its cessation. [104] He
decreases it and does not increase it, [105] retreats from it and does not
advance [towards it], [lets it] cease and does not give rise to it, abandons it and does not cling to it.


"What does he decrease and does not increase? He decreases bodily
form and does not increase it, he decreases feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness and does not increase it.


"What does he retreat from and does not advance [towards]? He retreats from bodily form and does not advance [towards it], he retreats
from feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness and does not
advance [towards it].

"What does he [let] cease and does not give rise to? He [lets] bodily
form cease and does not give rise to it, he [lets] feeling ... perception ...
formations ... consciousness cease and does not give rise to it.


"What does he abandon and does not cling to? He abandons bodily
form and does not cling to it, he abandons feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness and does not cling to it.


"Decreasing and not increasing it, [12a] he is established in the peace
of decreasing. Retreating from it and not advancing [towards it], he is
established in the peace of retreating. [Letting it] cease and not giving
rise to it, he is established in the peace of cessation. Abandoning it and
not clinging to it, he does not give rise to the bondage of attachment. [106]
Not being bound by attachment he personally realizes Nirvāṇa, [knowing]: 'Birth for me has been eradicated, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, I myself know that there
will be no receiving of further existence.'"


When the Buddha spoke this discourse, by not clinging a group of
many monks attained liberation from the influxes in their minds. [107]
When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, the monks, hearing what
the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.


106 This passage has no direct counterpart in [[SN22.79]] which after describing the attainment of awakening, however, continues by taking up again the four phrases mentioned earlier. This is followed by a poem describing the homage paid to such a monk
by _deva_ [[SN107]] [[SN22.79]] does not report the effect the discourse had on its audience.

# 47. [First Discourse on Faith] [108]

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.


At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: "A clansman with a
faithful mind should reflect: 'I should follow the Dharma, I should
dwell cultivating much disenchantment in relation to bodily form,
dwell cultivating much disenchantment in relation to feeling ...
perception ... formations ... consciousness.


"Because a clansman with a faithful mind dwells cultivating much disenchantment in relation to bodily form, dwells cultivating much disenchantment in relation to feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness, he gains disenchantment with bodily form, gains disenchantment
with feeling … perception ... formations ... consciousness. [109] Being disenchanted, he is free from desire and liberated. Being liberated he knows
and sees: 'Birth for me has been eradicated, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, I myself know that there will
be no receiving of further existence.'"


When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, the monks, hearing what
the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.


108 Parallel: [[SN22.39]] at SN III 40,22 (which is also a parallel to [[SA27]] cf. Anālayo
2012: 45). Akanuma 1929/1990: 28 instead identifies [[SN22.146]] as a parallel to the
present discourse, and then [[SN22.147]] as a parallel to the next, [[SA47]] The correct
identification has been discussed in Glass 2007: 185f. The main difference is that [[SN22.39]] introduces its exposition with a reference to practising the Dharma in accordance with the Dharma, whereas [[SN22.146]] speaks of having gone forth out of faith.
The exposition given in [[SN22.39]] and [[SN22.146]] is followed in each case by other
discourses who apply the same to impermanence, _dukkha_, and not-self, resulting in
[[SN22.40-42]] and [[SN22.147-148]] (where in E [e] the application to _dukkha_ seems to
have been lost). No parallels to these discourses appear to be known. For discourses
46 to 56 my reconstruction of the respective titles is based on the _uddāna_ found after
discourse 56.

109 According to [[SN22.39]] at SN III 40,28, having disenchantment ( _nibbidā_ ) he fully understands ( _parijānāti_ ) the aggregates. This then leads to being freed from the aggregates and thus being freed from all _dukkha._

# 48. [Second Discourse on Faith] [110]

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.


At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: "A clansman with a
faithful mind, who out of right faith has gone forth into homelessness,
thinks to himself: 'I should follow the Dharma, I should dwell cultivating much disenchantment in relation to bodily form, dwell cultivating
much disenchantment in relation to feeling ... perception ... formations ...
consciousness.


"A clansman with a faithful mind who out of right faith has gone forth
into homelessness and who has dwelled cultivating much disenchantment in relation to bodily form, has dwelled cultivating much disenchantment in relation to feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness, gains freedom from bodily form, gains freedom from
feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness. [111] I say, such a
person is completely freed from all birth, old age, disease, death,
worry, sorrow, vexation, and pain."


When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, the monks, hearing what
the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.

111 According to [[SN22.146]] at SN III 179,15, having disenchantment he fully understands
the aggregates. This then leads to being freed from the aggregates and thus being freed
from all _dukkha._ The Gāndhārī fragment, Glass 207: 189, also proceed from disenchantment to full understanding, and then from full understanding to being freed.

Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.


At that time the Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda: "If a faithful householder or the son of a householder comes and asks you: [113] 'In
relation to what things should one understand their arising and passing
away?' [114] [12b] How would you answer?"


Ānanda said to the Buddha: "Blessed One, if a faithful householder or
the son of a householder comes and asks me this, [115] I would answer:
'One understands that bodily form is of a nature to arise and pass away,
one understands that feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness is of a nature to arise and pass away.' [116] Blessed One, if a faithful
householder or the son of a householder asks me like this, I would
answer in this way."


The Buddha said to Ānanda: "It is well, it is well, that you should answer in this way. Why is that? Bodily form is of a nature to arise and
pass away, feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness is of a
nature to arise and pass away. Understanding that bodily form is of a
nature to arise and pass away is called the understanding of bodily
form. Understanding that feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness is of a nature to arise and pass away is called the understanding of consciousness." [117]


113 Kha ii 12k1, La Vallée Poussin 1913: 573: _upasaṃkramyaivaṃ pṛccheyuḥ._

114 The question (and subsequent discussion) in [[SN22.37]] at SN III 37,30 concerns not
only arising and passing away, but also an 'otherwiseness' [i.e., a change] while things
persists. The same threefold distinction is also found in [[AN5.43]] at AN I 152,7, in
which case a similar presentation is found in a parallel, [[EA22.5]] at T II 607c15; cf.
also the _Abhidharmakośavyākhyā_, Wogihara 1932: 171,26: _trīṇîmāni bhikṣavaḥ_

_'pi prajñāyate, vyayo 'pi prajñāyate, sthity-anyathātvam apîti_ . The same type of
presentation can also be found in the _Vastusaṃgrahaṇī_, T 1579 at T XXX 795c21:
三有為相施設可得, 一生, 二滅, 三住異性.

At that time the Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda: "If outside
wanderers come and ask you: 'Ānanda, for what reason does the Blessed
One teach people the cultivation of the holy life?' Being asked in this
way, how would you answer?" [119]


Ānanda said to the Buddha: "Blessed One, if outside wanderers come
and ask me: 'Ānanda, for what reason does the Blessed One teach people the cultivation of the holy life?' I would answer: [120] 'For cultivating
disenchantment in relation to bodily form, for being free from desire
for it, for its cessation, for being liberated from it, for not giving rise
to it does the Blessed One teach people the cultivation of the holy life.


"For the cultivation of disenchantment in relation to feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness, for being free from desire for it,
for its cessation, for being liberated from it, for not giving rise to it
does [the Blessed One] teach people the cultivation of the holy life.' [121]


without indicating that one who understands this is reckoned to be understanding the
aggregates.

Monks, bodily form is of a nature to be destroyed. The cessation and
quenching of bodily form is not of a nature to be destroyed. Feeling ...
perception ... formations ... consciousness is of a nature to be destroyed.
The cessation and quenching of consciousness is not of a nature to be

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was wandering among the
people of the Kosala country, staying in a Siṃsāpa grove north of the
village of Sālā.


At that time the village chiefs, Brahmins from great clans, had heard
that the recluse [Gotama], son of the Sakyans, from the great Sakyan
clan, who has shaved off hair and beard, donned the yellow robes, and
out of right faith gone forth into homelessness to train in the path, has
accomplished supreme and full awakening. He is wandering here
among the people of the Kosala country and has reached this village
of Sālā, staying in a Siṃsāpa grove north of it. [127]


Moreover, that recluse Gotama has been commended with such kind
of repute, heard in the eight directions, as one who is praised as truly
virtuous by _deva_ s and humans: He is a Tathāgata, an arahant, fully and

perfectly awakened, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, a well
gone one, a knower of the worlds, an unsurpassable person, a leader of
persons to be tamed, teacher of _deva_ s and humans, a Buddha, a Blessed
One. In the whole world, among _deva_ s, Māras, Brahmās, recluses and
Brahmins, he has great wisdom and has personally been able to realize
and know that: 'Birth for me has been eradicated, the holy life has
been established, what had to be done has been done, I myself know
that there will be no receiving of further existence.'


To the world he teaches a Dharma that is good in its beginning, middle, and end, that has good meaning and good expression, and [he
teaches] an entirely complete and pure holy life. He expounds the
sublime Dharma. It is well if one would see him, it is well if one
would approach him, it is well if one would pay respect to him!


Having had this thought, they harnessed their horses and, followed by
many attendants carrying golden containers, sticks, [128] and parasols,
they approached the Buddha to pay respect and make offerings. Having reached the entrance to the grove they descended from their chariots to proceed on foot to approach the Blessed One. They inquired
about his well being, withdrew to sit to one side and said to the Blessed
One: "Recluse Gotama, what do you proclaim, what do you teach?"


The Buddha told the Brahmins: "I proclaim causes, I teach causes."


They again said to the Buddha: "What causes do you proclaim, what
causes do you teach?"


The Buddha said to the Brahmins: "There are causes and conditions
for the arising of the world, there are causes and conditions for the
world to arise. There are causes and conditions for the cessation of the
world, there are causes and conditions for the world to cease."


The Brahmins said to the Buddha: "Blessed One, what are the causes
and conditions for the arising of the world, what are the causes and
conditions for the world to arise?"


128 Yìnshùn 1983: 167 note 2 suggests to emend 杖枝 to 金杖, as a result of which the
sticks would be "golden", just as the previously mentioned containers.


On the Five Aggregates (4)－A Translation of
_Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 33 to 58 47


The Buddha said to the Brahmins: "A foolish unlearned worldling
does not understand as it really is the arising of bodily form, the cessation of bodily form, the gratification in bodily form, the danger in
bodily form, and the escape from bodily form. Because of not understanding it as it really is, he craves for and delights in bodily form, he
commends bodily form, and he dwells with the mind defiled by attachment. Because of craving for and delighting in bodily form, he
clings to it. In dependence on clinging there is becoming. [13a] In dependence on becoming there is birth. In dependence on birth there is
old age, death, worry, sorrow, vexation, and pain. This is how this
great mass of _dukkha_ arises.


"Feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness _is also like this_ .
Brahmins, these are called the causes and conditions for the arising of
the world, these are the causes and conditions for the world to arise."


The Brahmins said to the Buddha: "What are the causes and conditions
for the cessation of the world, what are the causes and conditions for
the world to cease?"


The Buddha said to the Brahmins: "A learned noble disciple understands as it really is the arising of bodily form, the cessation of bodily
form, the gratification in bodily form, the danger in bodily form, and
the escape from bodily form. Understanding it as it really is, he does
not crave for or delight in bodily form, he does not commend it, and
he dwells without being defiled by attachment and without taking a
stance on it. Because of dwelling without craving and delight, and
without taking a stance on it, craving for bodily form ceases. With the
cessation of craving, clinging ceases. With the cessation of clinging,
becoming ceases. With the cessation of becoming, birth ceases. With
the cessation of birth, old age, death, worry, sorrow, vexation, and
pain cease.


"Feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness _is also like this_ .
Brahmins, these are called the causes and conditions for the cessation
of the world, these are the causes and conditions for the world to

The Brahmins said to the Buddha: "Gotama, in this way you proclaim
causes, in this way you teach causes. We have many affairs in the world,
now we request permission to return."


The Buddha said to the Brahmins: "Know that it is the proper time for it."


When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, the Brahmins, hearing
what the Buddha had said, were delighted and rejoiced in it. They paid
respect at his feet and left.

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Vārāṇasī in
the Deer Park, the Dwelling-place of Seers.


At that time a brahmin from the *Vigatāloka village had come and
approached the Buddha. [130] He paid respect, exchanged polite greetings, withdrew to sit to one side, and said to the Buddha: "Gotama, I
have a young disciple who knows astrology and family lineages, and
who for the whole great assembly makes predictions based on auspicious and inauspicious marks. Of what he says to exist, it certainly
exists. Of what he says not to exist, it certainly does not exist. Of what
he says that it becomes accomplished, it certainly will be accomplished. Of what he says that it will be ruined, it certainly will be
ruined. Gotama, what do you think about this?"

who knows astrology and family lineages, and who for the great
assembly makes such statements that of what he says that it exists, it
certainly exists; of what he says that it does not exist, it certainly does
not exist. What he knows and sees, is it not unreal?"


The Brahmin said to the Buddha: "It is like this, Blessed One."


The Buddha said to the Brahmin: "What do you think, [13b] is there a
bodily form that remains permanent for a hundred years, or does it
arise differently and cease differently? [Is there] feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness that remains permanent for a hundred years, or does it arise differently and cease differently?"


He replied: "It is like this, Blessed One, [it arises and ceases differently]."


The Buddha said to the Brahmin: "What do you think, your young
disciple who knows astrology and family lineages, and who for the
great assembly makes statement about what will be accomplished and
what will not be ruined, what he knows and sees, is it quite different

[from what I just stated]?"


He replied: "It is like this, Blessed One."


The Buddha said to the Brahmin: "What do you think, this teaching
and that teaching, this saying and that saying, which is superior?"


The Brahmin said to the Buddha: "Blessed One, this is speaking according to the Dharma, as the Buddha has spoken, by revealing and
instructing. It is just as being able to rescue a person who is drowning,

being able to rescue a prisoner who has been caught, [131] showing the
road to one who is lost, or bestowing a bright light to one who is in
darkness. [132] The Blessed One has now well spoken the sublime Dharma and further revealed and instructed me in this way."


When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, the Brahmin *Vigatāloka,
hearing what the Buddha had said, was delighted and rejoiced in it. He
rose from his seat, paid respect at [the Buddha's] feet and left.

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Vārāṇasī in
the Deer Park, the Dwelling-place of Seers.


At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: "I will now teach you
the aggregates and the aggregates of clinging. What are the aggregates?
Whatever bodily form, whether past, future or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, sublime or repugnant, far or near, all that is collectively called the aggregate of bodily form. [134]


"Accordingly, whatever feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness _is also like this_ . All that is collectively called the aggregate
of feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness. These are
called the aggregates.


"What are the aggregates of clinging? This is if bodily form is with
influxes and there is clinging, if in relation to that bodily form – be it

When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, the monks, hearing what
the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.

# 56. [Discourse on Things With Influxes and With- out Influxes] [136]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Vārāṇasī in
the Deer Park, the Dwelling-place of Seers.


At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: "I will now teach you
things with influxes and without influxes. If bodily form is with influxes and there is clinging, one might give rise to craving or hatred
for that bodily form. _In the same way_ [if] feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness is with influxes and there is clinging, one
might give rise to craving or hatred for that consciousness. These are
called things with influxes. [137]

influxes and without clinging, one will not give rise to craving or
hatred for that bodily form – be it past, future, or present. [138] [13c] _In_

When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, the monks, hearing what
the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.

# 57. [Discourse at Pārileyya] [140]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. [141]


At that time the Buddha put on his robe and took his bowl to enter the
town of Sāvatthī to beg for food. Having returned, he took his robe
and bowl and, without informing the community and without telling
his attendant, alone and without a companion, he went to wander among
the people in the countries in the West. [142]

141 [[SN22.81]] at SN III 94,25 instead has the Ghositārāma in Kosambī as its venue. Spk II
304,1 relates the present discourse to the litigation that had arisen among the Kosambī
monks.

142 Here and below, [[SN22.81]] does not give any indication about the direction in which
the Buddha had set out to wander.

_Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 33 to 58 53


that the Blessed One [had set out wandering] without informing the
community and without telling his attendant, alone and without a companion. Having seen it, he approached the venerable Ānanda and said
to Ānanda: "Venerable, you should know that, without informing the
community and without telling his attendant, the Blessed One has set
out wandering alone and without a companion."


At that time Ānanda said to that monk: "If the Blessed One, without
informing the community and without telling his attendant, has set out
wandering alone and without a companion, he should not be followed.
Why is that? Because now the Blessed One wishes to dwell at peace,
with little concerns." [143]


At that time, wandering north the Blessed One reached the village of
Pārileyya in the Vaṃsa country, where he dwelled at the root of a
Bhaddasāla tree in a grove guarded by men. [144]


Then a group of many monks approached Ānanda and said to Ānanda:
"We now [have come to] ask you: Where is the Blessed One dwelling?" [145]


Ānanda said: "I heard that wandering north the Blessed One has reached
the village of Pārileyya in the Vaṃsa country, where he dwells at the
root of a Bhaddasāla tree in a grove guarded by men."


Then the monks said to Ānanda: "Venerable, you should know that for
a long time we have not seen the Blessed One. [146] If this is not troublesome for you, could you together with us approach the Blessed One,

that not far from the village there was a protected wood, _rakkhitavanasaṇḍo_ . For a
survey of other instances where information provided in the Pāli commentaries is
similarly found in _Saṃyukta-āgama_ discourses, but not in the corresponding _Saṃyut_          _ta-nikāya_ parallel, cf. Wēn 2006 and Anālayo 2010a: 4f.

out of compassion?" [147] Ānanda, knowing that it was the [proper] time
for it, [148] accepted it by remaining silent.


At that time, in the morning, when the night was over, the venerable
Ānanda and the group of many monks put on their robes, took their
bowls and entered Sāvatthī to beg for food. Having begged for food,
they returned to the monastery, put away their bedding, took robes and
bowl, and went out to wander among the people in the countries in the
West. Wandering north they reached the village of Pārileyya in the
Vaṃsa country and the grove guarded by men. Then the venerable
Ānanda and the group of many monks put away their robes and bowls.
Having washed their feet, they approached the Blessed One, [14a]
paid respect with their heads at his feet, and sat to one side. [149]


At that time the Blessed One taught the Dharma to the group of many
monks, instructing, teaching, benefitting, and delighting them.


At that time there was one monk among those seated there who thought:
"How does one understand, how does one see so as to reach the destruction of the influxes quickly?"


At that time, knowing the thought in the mind of that monk, the Blessed
One said to the monks: "Perhaps among those seated here a monk
thinks: 'How does one understand, how does one see so as to reach the
destruction of the influxes quickly?'


"I have already taught you the Dharma: 'You should well contemplate
the aggregates, that is, [based on cultivating] the four establishments
of mindfulness, the four right efforts, the four bases for supernormal
power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening factors,


147 In [[SN22.81]] at SN III 95,24 the monks just express their wish to hear a teaching on
the Dharma from the Buddha, without suggesting that Ānanda could go with them to
approach the Buddha, although the same would be implicit; in fact Spk II 305,34 explains that they approached Ānanda because it would not really have been possible
for them to approach the Buddha on their own.

148 [[SN22.81]] makes no such indication.

149 [[SN22.81]] just mentions that Ānanda and the monks approached the Buddha, without
reporting that they first went begging, etc.


On the Five Aggregates (4)－A Translation of

and the eight factors of the noble path.' [150]

"I have already taught you the Dharma in this way, [151] how you should
contemplate the aggregates. Now a clansman who still does not make
an effort with the wish to act, does not make an effort delighting in it,
does not make an effort reflecting on it, does not make an effort having
confidence in it, but who is himself conceited and lazy, will be unable
to advance and to reach the destruction of the influxes. [152]


"Suppose again a clansman, being taught by me the Dharma on contemplating the aggregates, makes an effort with the wish [to act], makes
an effort delighting in it, makes an effort reflecting on it, makes an
effort having confidence in it. He is able to reach the destruction of the
influxes quickly. [153]


"A foolish unlearned worldling regards bodily form as the self. If he
regards bodily form as the self, this is called a formation. What is the
condition for this formation, how does it arise, how does it grow, how
does it evolve? Contact with ignorance gives rise to craving. In dependence on craving, this formation arises. [154]

151 At this juncture, [[SN22.81]] at SN III 96,19 continues directly by describing the unlearned worldling who sees bodily form as the self.

statement _evaṃ_ _deśiteṣu_ etc.); Dietz 1984: 53 note 182 comments that _ihaikatyo_ _moha_         _puruṣo should be ihaikatyā mohapuruṣā._

_atīvatīvrasnehā_ would be the result of dittography. [[SN22.81]] does not explicitly
mention the need to make an effort.

"That contact, feeling, craving, and formation are also impermanent, [160] conditioned by the mind, dependently arisen states. [161]

Tucci 1971: 244,22).

155 Instead of pursuing the condition for craving, [[SN22.81]] at SN III 96,28 indicates that
craving is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen, and that the same applies
to feeling, contact, and ignorance. Understanding and seeing this, one quickly destroys the influxes.

view of annihilation and by being perplexed about the Dharma.

_To be recited as previously up to_ self conceit. [170] One who understands
in this way and sees in this way quickly reaches the destruction of the
influxes."


When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, the monks, hearing what
the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.

# 58. [Discourse on Ten Questions] [171]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
the Eastern Park, the Hall of Migāra's Mother.


At that time the Blessed One rose from meditation in the afternoon and
sat on a seat prepared in front of the monks. He said to the monks:
"There are five aggregates of clinging. What are the five? That is, they
are the bodily form aggregate of clinging, the feeling ... perception ...
formations ... consciousness aggregate of clinging." [172]

the topics covered in the discourse.

172 According to [[MN109]] at MN III 15,18 and [[SN22.82]] at SN III 100,4, the Buddha was
seated with a community of monks on the observance day when a monk asked per

60 法鼓佛學學報第 14 期（2014）


Then one monk rose from his seat, adjusted his robes so as to bare his
right shoulder, knelt on the ground with his right knee and with palms
together said to the Buddha: "Blessed One, [may I ask a question about]
these five aggregates, the bodily form aggregate of clinging, the feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness aggregate of
clinging?" [173] 」


The Buddha said to the monk: "Return to your seat and ask. I will
explain it to you."


Then that monk paid respect to the Buddha and returned to his former
seat. He said to the Buddha: "Blessed One, what is the root of these
five aggregates of clinging, how do they arise, how do they grow, how
do they evolve?" [174]


The Buddha said to the monk: "These five aggregates of clinging have
their root in desire, they arise from desire, they grow from desire, they
evolve from desire."


Then that monk, hearing what the Buddha had said, was delighted and
rejoiced in it. He said to the Buddha: "Blessed One, it has been said
that the five aggregates are clung to, which is well said. Now I would
ask further about it. Blessed One, regarding the aggregates, are the
five aggregates different from the clinging to them?" [175]


The Buddha said to the monk: "The five aggregates are not the same
as the clinging to them and the five aggregates are not different from
the clinging to them. The potential of having desire and lust for them,


mission to pose a question and, on being given permission, inquired about the five
aggregates of clinging. The same is also reported in Kha ii 8c/viii 11n obv.5-7, La
Vallée Poussin 1913: 578.

that is the clinging to the five aggregates."


The monk said to the Buddha: "It is well, Blessed One", and he was
delighted and rejoiced in it. [176] "Now I have another question. Blessed
One, are two [instances of] the aggregates connected to each other?" [177]


The Buddha said to the monk: "It is like this, it is like this. Suppose a
person attends to them in this way: 'May I in the future obtain bodily
form like this, [14c] feeling like this, perception like this, formations
like this, and consciousness like this.' Monk, this is called connecting
aggregates to aggregates." [178]


The monk said to the Buddha: "This is well said", and he was delighted
and rejoiced in it. [179] Then he asked again: "Blessed One, what are
called the aggregates?"


The Buddha said to the monk: "Whatever bodily form, whether past,
future or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, sublime or repugnant, far or near, all that is collectively called the aggregate [of
bodily form]. This is called an aggregate. [180] Feeling ... perception ...
formations ... consciousness _is also like this_ . [181] In this way, monk,
these are called the aggregates."


The monk said to the Buddha: "This is well said", and he was delighted

177 As already noted by Choong 2000: 33, the question in [[SA58]] differs from [[MN109]] at
MN III 16,21 and [[SN22.82]] at SN III 101,4, where the monks asks if there is diversity
in desire and lust for the aggregates; cf. also the Sanskrit fragment below note 179.

and rejoiced in it. Then he asked again: "Blessed One, what is the
cause, what is the condition for calling it the bodily form aggregate?
What is the cause, what is the condition for calling it the feeling ...
perception ... formations ... consciousness aggregate?" [182]


The Buddha said to the monk: "The four elements are the cause, the
four elements are the condition for the bodily form aggregate being so
called. Why is that? It is because whatever bodily form there is, all of
it is the four elements and what is made based on the four elements. [183]


Contact is the cause, contact is the condition for the arising of feeling,
perception, and formations. Therefore the feeling, perception, and formations aggregates are so called. Why is that? Because whatever
feeling, perception, and formations there are, all of them are conditioned by contact. [184] Name-and-form is the cause, name-and- form is
the condition, wherefore the consciousness aggregate is so called. Why
is that? Because whatever consciousness there is, all of it is conditioned by name-and-form." [185]


The monk said to the Buddha: "This is well said", and he was delighted
and rejoiced in it. [186] Then he asked again: "What is the gratification in
bodily form? What is the danger in bodily form? What is the escape
from bodily form? What is the gratification in feeling ... perception ...

formations ... consciousness? What is the danger in consciousness?
What is the escape from consciousness?"


The Buddha said to the monk: "The delight and joy that arise in dependence on bodily form – this is called the gratification in bodily
form. Bodily form is impermanent, _dukkha_, and of a nature to change –
this is called the danger in bodily form. If one disciplines lustful desire,
abandons lustful desire, goes beyond lustful desire for bodily form –
this is called the escape from bodily form.


"The delight and joy that arise in dependence on feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness – this is called the gratification in
consciousness. Feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness is
impermanent, _dukkha_, and of a nature to change – this is called the
danger in consciousness. The disciplining of lustful desire, the abandoning of lustful desire, the going beyond lustful desire for feeling ...
perception ... formations ... consciousness – this is called the escape
from consciousness."


The monk said to the Buddha: "This is well said", and he was delighted
and rejoiced in it. Then he asked again: "Blessed One, how does the
I-conceit arise?" [187]


The Buddha said to the monk: "A foolish unlearned worldling regards
bodily form as the self, as distinct from the self [in the sense of being
owned by it], as existing [within the self, or the self] as existing [within it]. [188] He regards feeling ... perception [15a] ... formations ... consciousness as the self, as distinct from the self [in the sense of being
owned by it], as existing [within the self, or the self] as existing [within it]. [189] This is the arising of I-conceit."


187 In [[MN109]] at MN III 17,22 and [[SN22.82]] at SN III 102,5, where this question occurs
before the topic of gratification, etc., the point at stake is identity view, _sakkāyadiṭṭhi_,
instead of I-conceit, _asmimāna._

The monk said to the Buddha: "This is well said", and he was delighted
and rejoiced in it. Then he asked again: "Blessed One, how is there no
I-conceit?" [190]


The Buddha said to the monk: "A learned noble disciple does not regard bodily form as the self, as distinct from the self [in the sense of
being owned by it], as existing [within the self, or the self] as existing

[within it]. He does not regard feeling ... perception ... formations ...
consciousness as the self, as distinct from the self [in the sense of
being owned by it], as existing [within the self, or the self] as existing

[within it]."


The monk said to the Buddha: "This is well said. I have another question:
What is to be understood, what is to be seen, to reach the destruction
of the influxes quickly?" [191]


The Buddha said to the monk: "Whatever bodily form, whether past,
future or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, sublime or repugnant, far or near, all of it is not self, is not distinct from the self [in
the sense of being owned by it], does not exist [within the self, nor
does a self] exist [within it]. Feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness _is also like this._ Monk, understanding in this way, seeing in
this way, one quickly reaches the destruction of the influxes."


At that time among the assembly there was another monk with dull
faculties and unwise. Dwelling covered by ignorance he gave rise to a
wrong view, thinking: "If there is no self, and deeds are performed by
no self, then who will experience their fruit in the future?"


At that time, knowing the thought in the mind of that monk, the Blessed
One said to the monks: "Suppose among this community there is a
foolish person without wisdom and knowledge who thinks: 'If bodily
form is not self, feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness is


190 Kha ii 8c/viii 11n rev.11, La Vallée Poussin 1913: 579: _dyottaraṃ praśnam apṛcchat:_
_katham samanupaśyato bhadaṃta asmīti na bhavati._ [[MN109]] at MN III 18,29 and
[[SN22.82]] at SN III 103,9 take up the question how to avoid I-making, mine-making
and the underlying tendency to conceit.

191 My translation follows an emendation by Yìnshùn 1983: 179 note 3 of 盡 to 疾.

not self, and deeds are performed by no self, then who will experience
their fruit?' In this way he is perplexed. First of all, by way of explaining to him: How is it Monks, is bodily form permanent or is it impermanent?"


They replied: "It is impermanent, Blessed One."

[The Buddha said]: "What is impermanent, is it _dukkha_ ?"


[The monks] replied: "It is _dukkha_, Blessed One."


[The Buddha said]: "What is impermanent, _dukkha_, of a nature to
change, would a learned noble disciple herein see it as the self, as distinct from the self [in the sense of being owned by it], as existing [within
the self, or the self] as existing [within it]?"


[The monks] replied: "No, Blessed One."


[The Buddha said]: "Feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness _is_ _also_ _like_ _this_ . Therefore, monks, whatever bodily form, whether
past, future or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, sublime or
repugnant, far or near, all of it is not self and does not belong to a self.
One who sees it in this way has right view. Feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness _is also like this._


"A learned noble disciple who contemplates in this way cultivates disenchantment. Being disenchanted, he is free from desire. Being free
from desire, he is liberated. Being liberated, he knows and sees: 'Birth
for me has been eradicated, the holy life has been established, what
had to be done has been done, I myself know that there will be no receiving of further existence.'"


When the Buddha spoke this discourse, by not clinging a group of
many monks attained liberation from the influxes in their minds. [192]
When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, the monks, hearing what
the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.


192 [[MN109]] at MN III 20,22 reports that 60 monks became arahants. [[SN22.82]] concludes
without giving any such indication, but according to its commentary, Spk II 308,6,
[[SN22.82]] and the other discourses in this chapter each resulted in 500 monks becoming arahants.

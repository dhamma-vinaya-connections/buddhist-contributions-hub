I am indebted to Mike Running, Shi Syinchen, and Ken Su for their collaboration and
to the journal's proof readers for helpful suggestions.

1 The translated section comprises the fifth fascicle of the Taishō edition of the _Saṃ_             _yukta-āgama_, T II 29c6 to 37b25, corresponding to the fifth part of the section on the
aggregates according to the reconstructed order of this collection _._ My identification
of Pāli parallels is based on Akanuma 1929/1990 and Yìnshùn 1983, in the case of
Sanskrit fragment parallels I am indebted to Chung 2008. Here and elsewhere, I adopt
Pāli for proper names and doctrinal terms in order to facilitate comparison with the
Pāli parallels, except for terms like Dharma and Nirvāṇa, without thereby intending
to take a position on the original language of the _Saṃyukta-āgama_ manuscript used
for translation. In the case of reproducing Sanskrit texts from romanized editions, I
follow the conventions of the respective editors (except for capitalization). I only
reproduce the parts of the respective fragment that are sufficiently preserved so as to
make sense. My reconstruction of the respective titles is based on the _uddāna_ found
after discourse 110.

On the Five Aggregates (5)－A Translation of
_Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 103 to 110 3


# 103. [Discourse to Khemaka] [2]

Thus have I heard. At one time a group of many elder monks were
staying at Kosambī in Ghosita's Park. Then the monk Khemaka was
dwelling at Kosambī in the Jujube Tree Park. His body had become
seriously ill. Then the monk Dāsaka was looking after the sick. Then
the monk Dāsaka approached the elder monks, paid respect at the feet
of the elder monks, and stood at one side.


The elder monks said to the monk Dāsaka: "Approach the monk Khemaka and say: The elder monks ask you: 'Is your body recovering a
little and at ease, is the severity of your painful afflictions not increasing?'" [3]


Then the monk Dāsaka, having received the instructions from the elder monks, approached the monk Khemaka. He said to the monk
Khemaka: "The elder monks ask you: 'Are you gradually recovering
from your painful afflictions? Are the multitude of pains not increasing?'"


The monk Khemaka said to the monk Dāsaka: "I have not recovered
from the illness and my body is not at ease, the pains keep increasing
and there is no relief. It is just as if many strong men were to grab a
weak man, put a rope around his head and with both hands pull it tight,
so that he is in extreme pain. My pain now exceeds that. It is just as if
a cow butcher with a sharp knife cuts open a living [cow's] belly to
take its internal organs. How could that cow endure the pains in its
belly? My belly is now more painful than that cow's. It is just as if two

strong men grabbed one weak person and hung him over a fire, roasting both his feet. The heat of both my feet now exceeds that." [4]


Then the monk Dāsaka approached the elders. He completely told the
elders what the monk Khemaka had said about the condition of his
illness.


Then the elders sent the monk Dāsaka back to approach the monk
Khemaka, to say to the monk Khemaka: "There are five aggregates of
clinging, taught by the Blessed One. [5] What are the five? They are the
bodily form aggregate of clinging, the feeling … perception … formations … consciousness aggregate of clinging. Khemaka, are you
just able to examine these five aggregates of clinging as not self and
not belonging to the self?"


Then the monk Dāsaka, having received the instructions from the elder monks, approached the monk Khemaka and said: [6] "The elders say
to you: 'The Blessed One has taught the five aggregates of clinging.

[30a] Are you just able to examine them as not self and not belonging
to the self?'"


The monk Khemaka said to Dāsaka: "I am able to examine these five
aggregates of clinging as not self and not belonging to the self."


The monk Dāsaka returned and said to the elders: "The monk Khemaka says: 'I am able to examine these five aggregates of clinging as not
self and not belonging to the self.'"


The elders again sent the monk Dāsaka to say to the monk Khemaka:
"Being able to examine these five aggregates of clinging as not self

and not belonging, are you thus an arahant, with the influxes being
eradicated?" [7]


Then the monk Dāsaka, having received the instructions from the elder monks, approached the monk Khemaka. He said to Khemaka: "A
monk who is able to contemplate the five aggregates of clinging in
this way, is he thus an arahant, with the influxes being eradicated?"


The monk Khemaka said to the monk Dāsaka: "I contemplate the five
aggregates of clinging as not self and not belonging to the self, [yet] I
am not an arahant, with the influxes being eradicated."

Then the monk Dāsaka returned to the elders. [8] He said to the elders:
"The monk Khemaka says: 'I contemplate the five aggregates of clinging as not self and not belonging to the self, [9] yet I am not an arahant,
with the influxes being eradicated."


Then the elders said to the monk Dāsaka: "Return again to say to the
monk Khemaka: You say: 'I contemplate the five aggregates as not
self and not belonging to the self, yet I am not an arahant, with the
influxes being eradicated.' The former and the latter [statement] contradict each other.'"


Then the monk Dāsaka, having received the instructions from the elder monks, approached the monk Khemaka and said: [10] "You say: 'I
contemplate the five aggregates of clinging as not self and not belonging to the self, yet I am not an arahant, with the influxes being eradicated.' The former and the latter [statement] contradict each other."

The monk Khemaka said to the monk Dāsaka: "I examine these five
aggregates of clinging as not self and not belonging to the self, yet I
am not an arahant, [with the influxes being eradicated]. I have not yet
abandoned the 'I am' conceit, the desire [related to the notion] 'I am',
and the underlying tendency towards 'I am', have not yet [fully] understood it, not yet become separated from it, not yet vomited it out." [11]


The monk Dāsaka returned to the elders. He said to the elders: "The
monk Khemaka says: 'I examine these five aggregates of clinging as
not self and not belonging to the self, yet I am not an arahant, with the
influxes being eradicated. I have not yet abandoned the 'I am' conceit,
the desire [related to the notion] 'I am', and the underlying tendency
towards 'I am', have not yet [fully] understood it, not yet become separated from it, not yet vomited it out.'"


The elders again sent the monk Dāsaka to say to the monk Khemaka:
"You [seem] to affirm that there is a self. Where is that self? Is bodily
form the self? Or is the self distinct from bodily form? Is feeling …
perception … formations … consciousness the self? Or is the self
distinct from consciousness?"

The monk Khemaka said to the monk Dāsaka: [12] "I do not say that
bodily form is the self, or that the self is distinct from bodily form;
that feeling … perception … formations … consciousness is the self,

[30b] or that the self is distinct from consciousness. Yet in relation to
these five aggregates of clinging I have not yet abandoned the 'I am'
conceit, the desire [related to the notion] 'I am', and the underlying
tendency towards 'I am', have not yet [fully] understood it, not yet
become separated from it, not yet vomited it out."


11 In [[SN22.89]] at SN III 128,33 Khemaka had already during the previous exchange
mentioned the conceit 'I am', thus the present exchange is without parallel in [[SN22.89]] A similar passage can be found, however, in the _Abhidharmasamuccayabhāṣ_  _ya_, Tatia 1976: 62,5: _nāham āyuṣman dāsake mān pañcopādānaskandhān ātmata_

_[ā]tmīyato va samanupaśyāmyapi tvasti me eṣu pañcasūpādānaskandheṣvasmīti_
_māno 'smīti chando 'smītyanuśayo 'prahīṇo 'parijñāto 'nirodhito 'vāntīkṛta [[ITI12]] In [[SN22.89]] at SN III 129,27 Khemaka replies by directly indicating that he will
approach the elders himself.


On the Five Aggregates (5)－A Translation of
_Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 103 to 110 7


The monk Khemaka said to the monk Dāsaka: "Why trouble you now,
making you run back and forth? Bring my walking stick. Supporting
myself with the walking stick, I will approach the elders. [So] I ask
you to give me the walking stick for my use."


The monk Khemaka, supporting himself with the walking stick, approached the elders. Then the elders saw from afar that the monk Khemaka was coming, supported by a walking stick. They themselves prepared a seat for him and set up a foot rest. They came forward themselves to welcome him, took his robe and bowl, and told him to sit
down right away. [13] They exchanged polite greetings with each other.
Having exchanged polite greetings, the [elders] said to the monk Khemaka:


"You speak of the conceit 'I am'. Where do you see a self? Is bodily
form the self? Or is the self distinct from bodily form? Is feeling …
perception … formations … consciousness the self? Or is the self distinct from consciousness?"


The monk Khemaka said: "Bodily form is not self and there is no self
that is distinct from bodily form. Feeling … perception … formations … consciousness is not self, and there is no self that is distinct
from consciousness. However, in relation to these five aggregates of
clinging I have not yet abandoned the 'I am' conceit, [14] the desire [related to the notion] 'I am', and the underlying tendency towards 'I am',
have not yet [fully] understood it, not yet become separated from it,
not yet vomited it out.


"It is just like the fragrance of _uppala_ lotuses, _paduma_ lotuses, _ku_       _muda_ lotuses, _puṇḍarīka_ lotuses ― is the fragrance in the roots? Is the
fragrance distinct from the roots? Is the fragrance in the stalks, the
leafs, the stamen, its finer and coarser parts? Or is it distinct from …
its finer and coarser parts? Is this correctly spoken?"


13 [[SN22.89]] does not report that the elders prepared a seat, etc.

The elders replied: "No, monk Khemaka. The fragrance is not in the
roots of _uppala_ lotuses, _paduma_ lotuses, _kumuda_ lotuses, _puṇḍarīka_
lotuses, nor is the fragrance distinct from the roots. The fragrance is
also not in the stalks, the leafs, the stamen, its fine and coarse parts,
and the fragrance is also not distinct from … its fine and coarse parts."


The monk Khemaka asked again: "Where is the fragrance?"


The elders replied: "The fragrance is in the flower."


The monk Khemaka said again: "With me it is in the same way. Bodily form is not self and there is no self distinct from bodily form. Feeling … perception … formations … consciousness is not self, and there
is no self distinct from consciousness. Although in relation to these
five aggregates of clinging I see no self and nothing belonging to the
self, still I have not yet abandoned the 'I am' conceit, the desire [related to the notion] 'I am', and the underlying tendency towards 'I am',
have not yet [fully] understood it, not yet become separated from it,
not yet vomited it out.


"Elders, allow me to speak a simile. Wise ones usually gain understanding because of a comparison through a simile. It is just like a
wet-nurse who gives a cloth [used as diaper] to the launderer. With
various kinds of lye and soap he washes out the dirt, yet there is still a
remainder of smell. By mixing it with various kinds of fragrance he
makes that disappear. [15]


"In the same way, although the learned noble disciple rightly contemplates these five aggregates of clinging as not self and not belonging
to a self, [16] still he has not yet abandoned the 'I am' conceit in relation
to these five aggregates of clinging, [17] the desire [related to the notion]


15 According to the simile in [[SN22.89]] at SN III 131,8, where it is not evident how the
cloth became dirty, this cloth still smells of the washing materials, to get rid of which
the owners put it into a scented casket.

16 My rendering follows the suggestion by Yìnshùn 1983: 183 note 6 to emend 離 to
read 雖.

17 My rendering follows the suggestion by Yìnshùn 1983: 184 note 7 to emend 能 to

'I am', and the underlying tendency towards 'I am', has not yet [fully]
understood it, not yet become separated from it, not yet vomited it out.


"Yet at a later time he progresses in giving attention to these five aggregates of clinging by examining their rise and fall: [30c] this is
bodily form, this is the arising of bodily form, this is the cessation of
bodily form, this is feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, this is the arising of consciousness, this is the cessation of consciousness. Having contemplated the rise and fall of these five aggregates of clinging in this way, he completely relinquishes all 'I am' conceit, desire [related to the notion] 'I am', and the underlying tendency
towards 'I am'. This is called truly and rightly contemplating."


When the monk Khemaka spoke this teaching, the elders attained the
pure eye of Dharma that is remote from [mental] stains and free from

[mental] dust, and the monk Khemaka by not clinging attained liberation from the influxes in his mind. [18] Because of the benefit of the joy
of Dharma, his body got completely rid of the illness.


Then the elder monks said to the monk Khemaka: "When we heard
what [our] friend said for the first time, we already understood and
already delighted in it, what to say of hearing him again and again. [19]
When asking [further] we wished that [our] friend manifests his refined eloquence. Not to harass you, [but] for you to be willing and
able to teach in detail the Dharma of the Tathāgata, the arahant, the
fully awakened one."


Then the elders, hearing what the monk Khemaka had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.


18 According to [[SN22.89]] at SN III 132,10, not only Khemaka, but also the sixty elders
attained full awakening.

19 Such an indication is not made in [[SN22.89]] at SN III 132,1, where the elders simply
indicate that they wanted him to explain the teachings.

# 104. [Discourse to Yamaka] [20]

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.


At that time a monk called Yamaka had given rise to an evil wrong
view, speaking in this way: "As I understand the Dharma taught by the
Buddha, an arahant, with the influxes being eradicated, will not exist
anywhere after the body breaks up at the end of life."


Then a group of many monks heard what he had said. They approached the monk Yamaka and said to him: "Is it true that you said
this: 'As I understand the Dharma taught by the Buddha, an arahant,
with the influxes being eradicated, will not exist anywhere after the
body breaks up at the end of life'?"


He replied: "It is true, venerable ones."


Then the monks said to Yamaka: "Do not misrepresent the Blessed
One! It is not good to misrepresent the Blessed One. The Blessed One
does not say this. You should completely give up this evil wrong
view."


When the monks said this, the monk Yamaka still held on to his evil
wrong view, speaking in this way: "Venerable ones, only this is true,
what differs is false." He spoke in this way three times. [21]


When the monks were unable to correct the monk Yamaka, they forthwith gave up and left. They approached the venerable Sāriputta and
said to the venerable Sāriputta: "Venerable one, you should know that
the monk Yamaka has given rise to an evil wrong view in this way:
'[As] I understand the Dharma taught by the Buddha, an arahant, with
the influxes being eradicated, will not exist anywhere after the body
breaks up at the end of life.'


20 Parallels: [[SN22.85]] at SN III 109,15 and the as yet unpublished Schøyen manuscripts
2380/47 and 2380/54a, which have preserved parts of the simile of the murderer.

21 [[SN22.85]] does not mention three times.


On the Five Aggregates (5)－A Translation of
_Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 103 to 110 11


"Having heard what he had said, we therefore approached and asked
the monk Yamaka: 'Is it true that your understanding and view is like
this?' He replied to us: 'It is true, venerable ones, what differs [from
my understanding] is foolish talk.'


"We said: [31a] 'Do not misrepresent the Blessed One. The Blessed
One does not say this. You should give up this evil wrong view.' We
admonished him three times, yet he did not give up his evil wrong
view. Therefore we now have approached the venerable one. May the
venerable one appease the evil wrong view of the monk Yamaka, out
of compassion for him."


Sāriputta said: "It being like this, I will appease his evil wrong
view." [22]


Then the group of many monks, hearing what Sāriputta had said, rejoiced and were delighted. They returned to their former dwellings.


At that time, in the morning, the venerable Sāriputta put on his robe
and took his bowl to enter the town of Sāvatthī to beg for food. Having eaten, he came out of the town. Having returned to his monastery
to store away his robe and bowl, he approached the monk Yamaka. [23]


When the monk Yamaka saw from afar that the venerable Sāriputta
was coming, he prepared a seat for him, [water] for washing the feet,
and set up a foot rest. He welcomed him, taking his robe and bowl, [24]
and invited him to sit down right away.


22 In [[SN22.85]] at SN III 110,26 Sāriputta expresses his acceptance of the task by remaining silent.

23 In [[SN22.85]] at SN III 110,27 Sāriputta approaches Yamaka after emerging from
seclusion in the afternoon, thus [[SN22.85]] does not report his going to beg food in
town, etc.

24 The present reference to taking the robe and bowl of the arriving monk seems to be
the result of the application of a pericope description, since according to the preceding narration Sāriputta had stored these in his own dwelling and thus would have
been arriving without them. Perhaps this part originates from the preceding discourse
[[SA103]] where the providing of a foot rest makes sense since Khemaka was seriously
ill and thus presumably not in a condition to sit comfortably without such an aid. The
circumstance that in both discourses the description begins by indicating that the
monk(s) saw from afar that a visiting monk was coming could easily have led to [[AN12]] 法鼓佛學學報第 15 期（2014）


Having right away sat down and washed his feet, the venerable Sāriputta said to the monk Yamaka: "Is it true that you speak in this way:
'[As] I understand the Dharma taught by the Blessed One, an arahant,
with the influxes being eradicated, will not exist anywhere after the
body breaks up at the end of life'?"


The monk Yamaka replied to Sāriputta: "It is true, venerable Sāriputta."


Sāriputta said: "I will now ask you, answer me according to your understanding. How is it, Yamaka, is bodily form permanent or is it impermanent?"


[Yamaka] replied: "It is impermanent, venerable Sāriputta."


[Sāriputta] asked again: "What is impermanent, is it _dukkha_ ?"


[Yamaka] replied: "It is _dukkha_ ."


[Sāriputta] asked again: "What is impermanent, _dukkha_, of a nature to
change, would a noble disciple herein [regard] it as the self, as distinct
from the self [in the sense of being owned by it], as existing [within
the self, or the self] as existing [within it]?"


[Yamaka] replied: "No, venerable Sāriputta."


Feeling … perception … formations … consciousness _is also like_
_this._ [25]


application of the description given in [[SA103]] to [[SA104]] [[SN22.85]] at SN III 110,29
abbreviates the description of what happened on Sāriputta's arrival. Judging from
other discourses in the same collection, it seems that the part to be supplemented
here would only be the standard description of a friendly exchange of greetings, followed by sitting down.

25 [[SN22.85]] at SN III 111,13 at this point takes the instruction up to the realization of
arahant-ship (given in abbreviation). This provides a better transition to what follows,
since in this way the attainment of arahant-ship forms a basis for the subsequent discussion of the nature of the Tathāgata. In the present context, the term Tathāgata
would stand for an arahant in general, not specifically for the Buddha (cf. also Bodhi
2000: 1079 note 152) and also not for a being in general (contrary to the commentarial gloss at Spk II 311,1: _tathāgato ti satto_ ); cf. in more detail Anālayo 2008: 278f.


On the Five Aggregates (5)－A Translation of
_Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 103 to 110 13


[Sāriputta] asked again: "How is it, Yamaka, is bodily form the Tathāgata?"


[Yamaka] replied: "No, venerable Sāriputta."


[Sāriputta asked again]: "Is feeling … perception … formations …
consciousness the Tathāgata?"


[Yamaka] replied: "No, venerable Sāriputta."


[Sāriputta] asked again: "How is it, Yamaka, is the Tathāgata distinct
from bodily form? Is the Tathāgata distinct from feeling … perception … formations … consciousness?"


[Yamaka] replied: "No, venerable Sāriputta."


[Sāriputta] asked again: "Is the Tathāgata in bodily form? Is the Tathāgata in feeling … perception … formations … consciousness?"

[Yamaka] replied: "No, venerable Sāriputta." [26]


[Sāriputta asked again]: "Is bodily form in the Tathāgata? Is feeling …
perception … formations … consciousness in the Tathāgata?" [27]


[Yamaka] replied: "No, venerable Sāriputta."


[Sāriputta] asked again: "Is the Tathāgata without bodily form … feeling … perception … formations … consciousness?"


[Yamaka] replied: "No, venerable Sāriputta." [31b]


[Sāriputta said]: "In this way, Yamaka, the Tathāgata as existing truly
here and now cannot be gotten at anywhere, cannot be designated anywhere. Why do you say: '[As] I understand the Dharma taught by the
Buddha, an arahant, with the influxes being eradicated, will not exist


26 [[SN22.85]] at SN III 111,20 presents the same inquiries in a different manner, as here
Sāriputta first inquires if Yamaka takes the Tathāgata to be in bodily form, and then
if he takes him to be distinct from bodily form. After that Sāriputta turns to the other
aggregates.

27 This inquiry is not found in [[SN22.85]] which instead at SN III 111,32 reports the inquiry if the Tathāgata is equivalent to the five aggregates together. The exposition in
[[SA104]] thus follows more closely the pattern of the twenty modes of identity view,
_sakkāyadiṭṭhi._

anywhere after the body breaks up at the end of life'? Is that properly
spoken?" [28]


[Yamaka] replied: "No, venerable Sāriputta."


[Sāriputta] asked again: "Yamaka, earlier you said: '[As] I understand
the Dharma taught by the Buddha, an arahant, with the influxes being
eradicated, will not exist anywhere after the body breaks up at the end
of life'. Why are you now replying by stating that this is not the case?"


The monk Yamaka said: "Venerable Sāriputta, earlier I did not understand. Because of ignorance I generated and expressed an evil wrong
view like this. Having heard what the venerable Sāriputta said, all that
lack of understanding and ignorance have been completely abandoned."


[Sāriputta] asked again: "Yamaka, if you are further asked: 'Monk, as
you earlier declared an evil wrong view, knowing and seeing what has
this now all been completely removed?' [29] What would you answer?"


Yamaka replied: "Venerable Sāriputta, if someone comes and asks, I
would answer in this way: 'The bodily form of an arahant, with the influxes being eradicated, is impermanent. What is impermanent, is _duk_ _kha_ . What is _dukkha_ has become tranquil and become cool, it has forever disappeared. Feeling, perception … formations … consciousness
_is also like this_ .' [If] someone comes and asks, I would answer in this
way."


Sāriputta said: "It is well, it is well, monk Yamaka. You should answer in this way. Why is that? The bodily form of an arahant, with the
influxes being eradicated, is impermanent. What is impermanent, is
_dukkha_ . What is impermanent and _dukkha_ is of a nature to rise and


28 My translation is based on the assumption that the qualification 時 found at this
point is the result of confounding _kalya_ with _kālya_ . Literally translating the Chinese
as it is would result in Sāriputta inquiring if what Yamaka had said was "timely"
spoken, which does not fit the context well. The corresponding inquiry in [[SN22.85]]
at SN III 112,6 reads indeed _kallaṃ nu te_, "it is proper for you?"

29 The inquiry in [[SN22.85]] at SN III 112,14 differs in as much as Sāriputta asks Yamaka
how he would answer on being queried about what happens to an arahant at death.

_Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 103 to 110 15


fall. [30] Feeling … perception … formations … consciousness _is also_
_like this_ ."


When the venerable Sāriputta spoke this teaching, the monk Yamaka
attained the pure eye of Dharma that is remote from [mental] stains
and free from [mental] dust.


The venerable Sāriputta said to the monk Yamaka: "I will now speak a
simile. Wise persons gain understanding through a simile. It is like the
son of a householder; a son of a householder who is very rich and has
much wealth. He seeks widely for a retinue that well protects his
wealth.


"Then an evil person who is his enemy pretends to have come as a
close friend in order to become his retainer. [31] He often waits for an
opportunity, going to sleep late and rising early, looking after him
nearby when he rests. He is careful and respectful in his affairs, modest in his words, causing his master to think of him with delight, to
perceive him as a friend, to perceive him as a son, with utmost trust
and without doubt, without guarding himself. Later on, with a sharp
knife in his hand, he cuts off [his master's] life.


"Monk Yamaka, what do you think? That evil enemy, acting at the
householder's friend, was he not acting from the outset as an expedient
with a mind intent on harm, constantly waiting for an opportunity until
bringing about [the householder's] end? [32] Yet that householder was
not able to realize it, until the moment he suffered harm."


[Yamaka] replied: "It is true, venerable [Sāriputta]." [31c]


Sāriputta said to the monk Yamaka. "What do you think? Had that
householder actually understood that the man pretending to be a friend


30 Adopting the variant 若 instead of 苦. In [[SN22.85]] at SN III 112,25 Sāriputta does
not repeat the point made by Yamaka, but instead proceeds directly with the simile
of the rich man.

31 [[SN22.85]] at SN III 113,1 reports the murderer reflecting how he can best fulfill his
aim.

32 Sāriputta's inquiry in [[SN22.85]] at SN III 113,14 is longer, taking up various aspects
of the murderer's behaviour.


16 法鼓佛學學報第 15 期（2014）


wished his harm, would he have well guarded himself and not suffered
harm?" [33]


[Yamaka] replied: "It is like this, venerable Sāriputta."


[Sāriputta said]: "In the same way, monk Yamaka, a foolish unlearned
worldling perceives these five aggregates of clinging as permanent,
perceives them as ease, perceives them as health, perceives them as
the self, perceives them as belonging to the self. He keeps guarding
and cherishing these five aggregates of clinging. In the end he is
harmed by the enemy of the five aggregates of clinging, just as that
householder was harmed by the enemy pretending to be a friend, without realizing it. [34]


"Yamaka, a learned noble disciples who examines these five aggregates of clinging as a disease, as a carbuncle, as a thorn, as a killer, as
impermanent, as _dukkha_, as empty, as not self, and as not belonging to
a self, [35] does not cling to these five aggregates of clinging and [therefore] is not attached to them.


"Because of not clinging he is not attached, because of not being attached he personally realizes Nirvāṇa, [knowing]: 'Birth for me has
been eradicated, the holy life has been established, what had to be
done has been done, I myself know that there will be no receiving of
any further existence.'"


33 This query has no counterpart in [[SN22.85]]

34 [[SN22.85]] at SN III 113,26 takes up the case of the unlearned worlding in more detail,
describing his taking the five aggregates of clinging to be a self in the twenty modes
that make up the standard presentation of identity view, followed by describing his
not understanding them, as they really are, to be impermanent, unsatisfactory, not
self, conditioned, and 'murderous'.

35 [[SN22.85]] at SN III 114,30 works through the same topics used in its exposition of the
worldling when taking up the case of the noble disciple, of course with the difference
that the noble disciple does the very opposite of the worldling. [[SN22.85]] does not
have a counterpart to the indication in [[SA104]] that in this way the noble disciple realizes Nirvāṇa.


On the Five Aggregates (5)－A Translation of
_Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 103 to 110 17


When the venerable Sāriputta spoke this teaching, the monk Yamaka
by not clinging attained liberation from the influxes in his mind. [36]


The venerable Sāriputta, having spoken this teaching to the monk
Yamaka, having instructed, taught, illuminated, and delighted him,
rose from his seat and left. [37]

# 105. [Discourse to Seniya] [38]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in
the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Feeding Place.


At that time a heterodox wanderer called Seniya approached the Buddha, paid respect, exchanged greetings, sat at one side, and said to the
Buddha: "Blessed One, on a former day recluses, brahmins, itinerants
( _caraka_ ), and wanderers ( _paribbājaka_ ) gathered in a hall in the hope
of some discussion on what is meaningful and praiseworthy in this
way:


"'Pūraṇa Kassapa is the leader of a great congregation, being surrounded on all sides by five hundred disciples. There are among them
some who are very wise and some who have dull faculties. When they
pass away, he does not declare of any of them the place where they
have been reborn.

"There is also Makkhali Gosālaputta, [39] who is the leader of a great
congregation, being surrounded on all sides by five hundred disciples.


36 In [[SN22.85]] at SN III 115,28 Yamaka himself states that he has reached full awakening.

37 [[SN22.85]] at SN III 115,31 instead closes with the standard description of the delight
of the audience, in this case of Yamaka.

38 Parallel: a discourse quotation in T 1509 at T XXV 368b20, translated by Lamotte
1976: 2141f note 1. Akanuma 1929/1990: 32 mentions [[SN44.9]] which is too different to be considered a parallel.

39 Basham 1951: 78 explains that while Pāli texts give his name just as Gosāla, in
Sanskrit literature he is referred to as Gośālīputra or Gośalikāputra (and Jain texts
speak of Gosāla Maṅkhaliputta).


18 法鼓佛學學報第 15 期（2014）


Some of his disciples are wise and some have dull faculties. When
they pass away, he does not declare of any of them the place where
they have been reborn.'


" _In the same way_ Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta, Ajita Kesakambalī, Pakudha
Kaccāyana, and Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta, each of them is surrounded on all
sides by five hundred disciples … _as above._


"The recluse Gotama was then also mentioned in that discussion: 'The
recluse Gotama is the leader of a great congregation … when his disciples pass away, he does declare that certain have been reborn in that
place, [32a] certain have been reborn in this place.' Formerly the doubt
had arisen in me: 'How come the recluse Gotama has reached a condition like this?'"


The Buddha said to Seniya: "Do not give rise to doubt! Because of
uncertainty, one gives rise to doubt. Seniya, you should know that
there are three kinds of teacher. What are the three?


"There is a teacher who has the view that [only] in the present world
there truly is a self, and he speaks according to his understanding, yet
he is not able to know matters of the afterlife. This is called the first

[kind of] teacher that appears in the world.


"Again, Seniya, there is a teacher who has the view that in the present
world there truly is a self, and he also has the view that in the afterlife
there [truly] is a self, and he speaks according to his understanding.

"Again, Seniya, [40] there is a teacher who does not have the view that
in the present world there truly is a self, and he also does not have the
view that in the afterlife there truly is a self.


"Seniya, the first teacher who has the view that in the present world
there truly is a self and who speaks according to his understanding, he
is reckoned as having the view of annihilation.


40 Adopting the variant 仙 instead of 先.


On the Five Aggregates (5)－A Translation of
_Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 103 to 110 19


"The second teacher who has the view that in the present world and in
the future world there truly is a self, and who speaks according to his
understanding, he has the view of eternalism.


"The third teacher who does not have the view that in the present
world there truly is a self, and who also does not have the view that in
the afterlife there [truly] is a self ― this is the Tathāgata, the arahant,
the fully awakened one, who in the present has abandoned craving,
become separated from desire, has made them cease, and has attained
Nirvāṇa." [41]


Seniya said to the Buddha: "Blessed One, having heard what the
Blessed One said had the effect of further increasing my doubt."


The Buddha said to Seniya: "It is right that your doubt should increase.
Why is that? This is a very profound matter, which is difficult to see
and difficult to understand. The very profound has to be illuminated in
its subtle aspects until it is comprehended by the wise. Living beings
of the common type are not able to distinguish and understand it. Why
is that? It is because living beings have for a long time had a different
view, a different acceptance, a different quest, and a different aspiration."


Seniya said to the Buddha: "Blessed One, [so that] my mind gains
pure faith in the Blessed One, may the Blessed One teach me the
Dharma so that in this very seat my wisdom eye will be purified."


The Buddha said to Seniya: "I shall teach you now according to your
liking."


The Buddha said to Seniya: "Is bodily form permanent or is it impermanent?"


[Seniya] replied: "It is impermanent."


The Blessed One asked again: "Seniya, what is impermanent, is it
_dukkha_ ?"


41 Adopting a variant that adds 得.


20 法鼓佛學學報第 15 期（2014）


[Seniya] replied: "It is _dukkha_ ."


The Blessed One asked Seniya again: "What is impermanent, _dukkha_,
of a nature to change, would a noble disciple herein [regard] it as the
self, as distinct from the self [in the sense of being owned by it], as existing [within the self, or the self] as existing [within it]?"


[Seniya] replied: "No, Blessed One."


Feeling … perception … formations … consciousness _is also like this._


[The Buddha] asked again: "How is it, Seniya, is bodily form the Tathāgata?"


[Seniya] replied: "No, Blessed One."


[The Buddha asked again]: "Is feeling … perception … formations …
consciousness the Tathāgata?"


[Seniya] replied: "No, Blessed One."


[The Buddha] asked again: "Seniya, is the Tathāgata distinct from
bodily form? [32b] Is the Tathāgata distinct from feeling … perception … formations … consciousness?"


[Seniya] replied: "No, Blessed One."


[The Buddha] asked again: "Seniya, is the Tathāgata in bodily form?
Is the Tathāgata in feeling … perception … formations … consciousness?"


[Seniya] replied: "No, Blessed One."


[The Buddha] asked again: "Seniya, is bodily form in the Tathāgata?
Is feeling … perception … formations … consciousness in the Tathāgata?"


[Seniya] replied: "No, Blessed One."


[The Buddha] asked again: "Seniya, is the Tathāgata without bodily
form … feeling … perception … formations … consciousness?"


[Seniya] replied: "No, Blessed One."


The Buddha said to Seniya: "[Although] all my disciples hear what I
teach, [some] do not completely understand its significance and do not
give rise to right comprehension of conceit. Because of not rightly


On the Five Aggregates (5)－A Translation of
_Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 103 to 110 21


comprehending it, they do not abandon conceit. Because they have not
abandoned conceit, on having given up these aggregates [at death]
they take part in the succession of aggregates and are reborn. For this
reason, Seniya, I declare that these disciples, when their body breaks
up at the end of life, have been reborn in this or that place. Why is that?
It is because they have a remainder of conceit.


"Seniya, [some] disciples of mine are able to understand the significance of what I teach. They gain right comprehension of all conceit.
Because of gaining right comprehension of it, they abandon all conceit.
Because they have abandoned all conceit, when the body breaks up at
the end of life there is no succession [of the aggregates for them].
Seniya, I do not declare that such disciples, on having given up these
aggregates [at death], are reborn in this or that place. Why is that? It is
because there is no condition whereby this could be declared.


"Wishing me to make some declaration, I would declare: 'They have
abandoned all craving and desire, are forever apart from the bondage
of existence, and their mind is rightly liberated with the complete ending of _dukkha_ .'


"From former times until the present, I constantly teach the danger in
conceit, [42] in the accumulation of conceit, in the arising of conceit, and
in the rising up of conceit. If conceit is contemplated with right comprehension, the manifold _dukkha_ does not arise."


When the Buddha spoke this teaching, the wanderer Seniya attained
the pure eye of Dharma that is remote from [mental] stains and free
from [mental] dust.


At that time the wanderer Seniya saw the Dharma and attained the
Dharma, abandoning all doubt and uncertainty, not needing to rely on
others to understand, not needing to rely on others to cross over, and
his mind had attained fearlessness in the right Dharma.


42 Yìnshùn 1983: 191 note 3 suggests to emend the present passage to read instead the
teaching of the "root" of conceit.


22 法鼓佛學學報第 15 期（2014）


He rose from his seat and with his palms held together [in respect]
towards the Buddha he said: "Blessed One, can I gain the going forth
in this right Dharma to cultivate the holy life?"


The Buddha said to Seniya: "You can gain the going forth in this right
Dharma, the receiving of full ordination, and the becoming of a member of the monastic [community]."


At that time Seniya, having gained the going forth, alone in a quiet
place practised dwelling without negligence, reflecting in this way on
that for the sake of which a clansman's son shaves off beard and hair
to go forth out of right faith into homelessness to train in the path and
cultivate the practice of the holy life, personally knowing here and
now and realizing directly that 'birth for me has been eradicated, the
holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, I
myself know that there will be no receiving of any further existence.'
He became an arahant.


Hearing what the Buddha had said, [32c] he was delighted and received it respectfully. [43]

# 106. [Discourse to Anurādha] [44]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in
the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Feeding Place. At that time a monk
called Anurādha was staying on Mount Vulture Peak. [45]


Then a group of many heterodox wanderers approached Anurādha and
exchanged greetings. Having exchanged greetings and standing at one


43 This conclusion seems a little out of place and would have a better placing before the
report of his attainment of arahant-ship.

44 Parallels: [[SN22.86]] at SN III 116,1 (= [[SN44.2]] at SN IV 380,3) and fragment Kha ii 3
recto, La Vallée Poussin 1913: 579.

45 According to [[SN22.86]] at SN III 116,1, the Buddha was staying in the Great Wood in
Vesalī and Anurādha was in a forest hut nearby.


On the Five Aggregates (5)－A Translation of
_Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 103 to 110 23


side, they said to Anurādha: "We would like to ask a question. Would
you have free time to explain it?"


Anurādha said to the heterodox [wanderers]: "Ask according to your
wish, on knowing it I shall reply."


The heterodox [wanderers] asked again: "How is it, venerable one,
does the Tathāgata exist after death?" [46 ]


Anurādha said: "According to the teaching of the Blessed One, this is

[left] undeclared."


They asked again: "Does the Tathāgata not exist after death?"


Anurādha said: "According to the teaching of the Blessed One, this is
also [left] undeclared."


They asked again: "Does the Tathāgata exist and not exist after death?
Does he neither exist nor not exist [after death]?"


Anurādha said: "According to the teaching of the Blessed One, this is
also [left] undeclared." [47]


They again asked Anurādha: "How is this, venerable one? [Being
asked]: 'Does the Tathāgata exist after death?', you reply that this is

[left] undeclared. [Being asked]: 'Does he not exist after death?', you
reply that this is [left] undeclared. [Being asked]: 'Does he exist and
not exist after death? Does he neither exist nor not exist?', you reply


46 In [[SN22.86]] at SN III 116,11 the heterodox wanderers do not ask for permission and
then present all four alternatives together, instead of posing them as single questions.
They also qualify the Tathāgata as the highest and supreme person, who has reached
the supreme. The same qualifications can also be found in the Sanskrit fragment,
Kha ii 3 R1, La Vallée Poussin 1913: 579: _uttamapuruṣaparamapuruṣaḥ parama_         _prāptiprāptaḥ ta[ṃ] v[ayaṃ]._

47 Instead of qualifying these positions as undeclared, according to [[SN22.86]] at SN III
116,19 Anurādha proposed that the Buddha had declared the nature of the Tathāgata
to be distinct from these four alternatives; cf. also Kha ii 3 R2, La Vallée Poussin
1913: 579: _ramapuruṣaḥ paramaprāptiprāptaḥ taṃ vayam anyatraiva._


24 法鼓佛學學報第 15 期（2014）


that this is [left] undeclared. [48] How is this, venerable one, is the recluse Gotama without knowledge and without vision?"


Anurādha said: "The Blessed One is not without knowledge, he is not
without vision."


Then the minds of the heterodox [wanderers] did not delight in what
Anurādha had said. Having blamed him, [49] they rose from their seats
and left.


When Anurādha knew that the heterodox [wanderers] had left, he approached the Buddha, [50] paid respect with his head at the Buddha's
feet and, standing at one side, told the Buddha fully what he had been
asked by the heterodox [wanderers]. [51] He said to the Buddha: [52]


"Blessed One, having been asked in this way, on replying in this way,
have I been speaking in line with the teachings? Have I not gotten into
misrepresenting the Blessed One? Is this in line with the Dharma or is
this in violation of the Dharma? On being closely questioned by others
who have come, will this not cause me to fall into an occasion for criticism?"


The Buddha said to Anurādha: "I will now ask you, answer according
to my questions. Anurādha, is bodily form permanent or is it impermanent?"


[Anurādha] replied: "It is impermanent."


48 Kha ii 3 R3, La Vallée Poussin 1913: 579: _na ca bhavati tathāgataḥ paraṃ maraṇān_
_naiva bhavati na na._ Kha ii 3 R4: _prajñapayamānāḥ prajñapayāmaḥ atha te anya_  _tīrthi._

49 In [[SN22.86]] at SN III 116,26 the heterodox wanderers conclude that Anurādha must
have been recently ordained or else he must be a fool.

50 Kha ii 3 R5, La Vallée Poussin 1913: 579: _raprakrāṃtānāṃ teṣām anyathīrtikapari_ _vrājakānāṃ āyuṣmat._

51 Kha ii 3 R6, La Vallée Poussin 1913: 579: _mya bhagavata etad artham._

52 [[SN22.86]] at SN III 117,2 records the reflection that motivated Anurādha to approach
the Buddha and also gives his report to the Buddha in more detail.


On the Five Aggregates (5)－A Translation of
_Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 103 to 110 25


[The Buddha asked again]: "Is feeling … perception … formations …
consciousness permanent or is it impermanent?"


[Anurādha] replied: "It is impermanent, Blessed One."


_As spoken fully in the Discourse to Yamaka, up to_ : "Is consciousness
the Tathāgata?" [53]


[Anurādha] replied: "No."


The Buddha said to Anurādha: "One who speaks in this way is in accordance and in line with all that has been declared [by me], he does
not misrepresent the Tathāgata and does not come to be [speaking] out
of order. He speaks as the Tathāgata speaks and is in order with all
teachings. [33a] On being closely questioned by others who have
come, there is nothing capable of being criticized. Why is that?


"I understand bodily form as it really is, I understand the arising of
bodily form … the cessation of bodily form … the path to the cessation of bodily form as it really is. [Feeling … perception … formations … consciousness _is also like this_ ]. [54]


"Anurādha, if one leaves behind what the Tathāgata has done and
claims he is without knowledge and without vision, then this is not
correctly spoken." [55]


When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, Anurādha, hearing what
the Buddha had said, was delighted and received it respectfully.


53 Judging from the context and from [[SN22.86]] the text that should be supplemented
from the Discourse to Yamaka would be up to the indication that "the Tathāgata as
existing truly here and now cannot be gotten at anywhere, cannot be designated anywhere".

54 As Vetter 2000: 232 note 97 points out, this passage mentions only bodily form.
Since all five aggregates are mentioned in the preceding part, I supplement the other
four aggregates here.

55 In [[SN22.86]] at SN III 118,35 the Buddha questions Anurādha if his former proposition (that a Tathāgata can be described apart from the four alternatives) is appropriate.
Anurādha admits that this is not appropriate. The Buddha then praises Anurādha for
this reply and points out that formerly as well as now he only teaches _dukkha_ and its
cessation.

# 107. [Discourse to a Householder] [56]

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying among the
Bhaggas at Suṃsumāragira in the Deer Park, the Bhesakaḷā Grove.


At that time the householder Nakula was hundred and twenty years
old, his faculties ripe with age. [Although] being weak and suffering
from disease, he still wished to come and meet the Blessed One and
the senior and esteemed monks who were his good friends ( _kalyāṇa_ _mitta_ ). He approached the Buddha, paid respect with his head at the
Buddha's feet, withdrew to sit at one side, and said to the Buddha:


"Blessed One, I am feeble from old age, I am weak and suffer from
disease, [yet] with my own strength I make the effort to come to meet
the Blessed One and the senior and esteemed monks who are my good
friends. May the Blessed One give me a teaching so that it will be for
my peace for a long time."


At that time the Blessed One said to the householder Nakula: "It is
well, householder. You are really ripe with age, being weak and suffering from disease, yet you are able with your own strength to come
to meet the Tathāgata and the other senior and esteemed monks who
are your good friends.

"Householder you should know, [57] [when] the body is suffering from
disease, you should constantly train that the  mind  does not suffer
from disease." [58]


56 Parallels: [[SN22.1]] at SN III 1,1 and [[EA13.4]] at T II 573a1.

57 [[SN22.1]] at SN III 1,14 and [[EA13.4]] at T II 573a8 precede this injunction with a reference to fools who claim to be healthy for a moment ([[SN22.1]]) or who rely on the
body to be happy for a moment ([[EA13.4]]).

58 My rendering here and in the next passage is based on emending 身 to read 心, an
emendation I mark with   in the translation. My emendation is based on the formulation used by Sāriputta in his exegesis and by the context. The parallels confirm that
it is the mind which should not be sick; cf. [[SN22.1]] at SN III 1,16: _cittaṃ anāturaṃ_
_bhavissati_ (E [e] : _cittam anāturam_ ) and [[EA13.4]] at T II 573a9: 令心無病; cf. also the
_Vastusaṃgrahaṇī_, T 1579 at T XXX 799a7. The occurrence of a similar error can be
seen in [[EA13.4]] which precedes this injunction by referring to the sick mind, T II


On the Five Aggregates (5)－A Translation of
_Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 103 to 110 27


At that time the Blessed One, having instructed, [59] taught, illuminated,
and delighted the householder Nakula, remained silent.


The householder Nakula, hearing what the Buddha had said, rejoiced
in it and was delighted. He paid respect to the Buddha and left. The
venerable Sāriputta was then seated under a tree not far from the Buddha. The householder Nakula approached the venerable Sāriputta, paid
respect with his head at [Sāriputta's] feet, and withdrew to sit at one
side.


Then the venerable Sāriputta asked the householder: "Your faculties
are now joyfully relaxed, the colour of your complexion is bright.
Have you been able to hear a profound teaching from the Blessed
One?"


The householder Nakula said to Sāriputta: "Today the Blessed One
has given me a teaching, instructing, teaching, illuminating, and delighting me, [as if] anointing my body and mind with the ambrosia of
the Dharma. For this reason my faculties are now joyfully relaxed and
my complexion is bright."


The venerable Sāriputta asked the householder: "How has the Blessed
One taught you the Dharma, instructing, teaching, illuminating, and
delighting you, [as if] anointing you with ambrosia?"


The householder Nakula said to Sāriputta: "I approached the Blessed
One. I said to the Blessed One: 'I am feeble from old age, weak, and
suffer from disease, yet with my own strength I come to meet the
Blessed One and the senior and esteemed monks who are my good
friends.'


"The Buddha said to me: 'It is well, householder. Your are really ripe
with age, [33b] being weak and suffering from disease, yet you are


573a9: 心有病, with only a variant reading preserving the clearly correct reference
to the sick body, 身有病 (also found later at T II 573a28 in the form 身雖有患).
Thus in this case an error appears to have occurred in relation to the preceding statement, resulting in replacing a correct reference to 身 with a wrong reference to 心.

59 My rendering follows the suggestion by Yìnshùn 1983: 195 note 2 to emend 宗 to
read 示.


28 法鼓佛學學報第 15 期（2014）


able with your own strength to come to meet me and the senior and
esteemed monks. Now that your body is suffering from disease, you
should constantly train that your  mind  does not suffer from disease.'
Giving me a teaching in this way, the Blessed One has instructed,
taught, illuminated, and delighted me, [as if] anointing me with ambrosia."


The venerable Sāriputta asked the householder: "Did you not proceed
to ask the Blessed One again: 'How does the body suffer from disease
and the mind [also] suffer from disease? How does the body suffer
from disease and the mind not suffer from disease?'"


The householder replied: "I have approached the venerable one because of the meaning [of this]. May he explain to me in brief the import of the teaching." [60]


The venerable Sāriputta said to the householder: "It is well, householder. Now listen to what I shall tell you. A foolish unlearned worldling does not understand as it really is the arising of bodily form, the
cessation of bodily form, the danger in bodily form, the gratification
in bodily form, [61] and the escape from bodily form. [62] Because of not
understanding it as it really is, he craves with delight for bodily form,
declaring bodily form to be the self or to belong to the self, and he
clings and takes hold of it.


"If his bodily form is ruined, if it becomes otherwise, his mind and
consciousness follow it in turn, giving rise to vexation and pain. Vexa

60 Whereas in [[SA107]] Nakula seems to have come on purpose to Sāriputta to receive a
more detailed explanation, [[SN22.1]] at SN III 3,1 gives the impression that he had at
first not thought of the possibility of receiving further explanations, but once Sāriputta mentioned this possibility, he happily took up the opportunity, indicating that
he would come a long way to get such explanations. [[EA13.4]] at T II 573a12, however,
explicitly records the householder reflecting that he would now approach Sāriputta to
ask about this matter.

61 In the standard formulation, found also below, the gratification comes before the
danger.

62 In [[SN22.1]] at SN III 3,15 and [[EA13.4]] at T II 573b10 the worldling's lack of insight
manifests in construing a self according to the different modes of identity view ( _sak_  _kāyadiṭṭhi_ ).

tion and pain having arisen, he is frightened, obstructed, worried, distressed, and passionately bound. With feeling … perception … formations … consciousness _it is also like this_ . This is called body and
mind suffering from disease.


"How does the body suffer from disease and the mind not suffer from
disease? A learned noble disciples understands as it really is the arising of bodily form, the cessation of bodily form, the gratification in
bodily form, the danger in bodily form, and the escape from bodily
form. Having understood it as it really is, he does not give rise to craving with delight, seeing bodily form as the self or as belonging to the
self.


"If his bodily form changes, if it becomes otherwise, his mind does not
follow it in turn, giving rise to vexation and pain. His mind not having
followed it in turn and given rise to vexation and pain, he does not get
frightened, obstructed, worried, [distressed], and passionately bound.
With feeling … perception … formations … consciousness _it is also_
_like this_ . This is called the body suffering from disease and the mind
not suffering from disease."


When the venerable Sāriputta spoke this teaching, the householder
Nakula attained the pure eye of Dharma. [63] At that time the householder Nakula saw the Dharma, attained the Dharma, understood the
Dharma, entered the Dharma, crossing beyond all doubt, not needing
to rely on others, his mind had attained fearlessness in the right Dharma.


He rose from his seat, adjusted his clothes, paid respect and, with his
palms held together [in respect] towards the venerable Sāriputta, he
said:


"I have gone beyond, I have crossed over. I now take refuge in the
jewels of the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṅgha as a lay follower,
be my witness that from today until the end of my life I take refuge in
the three jewels."

# 108. [Discourse on the West] [64]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying among the
Sakyans at Devadaha. At that time there was a group of many monks
from the west who wished to return to the west for the rains retreat. [65]
They approached the Blessed One, [33c] paid respect with their heads
at the Buddha's feet, and withdrew to sit at one side.


At that time the Blessed One taught them the Dharma, instructing,
teaching, illuminating, and delighting them. Then, having in various
ways been instructed, taught, illuminated, and delighted, the group of
many monks from the west rose from their seats and, with palms held
together [in respect] towards the Buddha, they said: "Blessed One, our
group of many monks from the west wishes to return to the west for
the rains retreat. We now ask respectfully to take our leave."


The Buddha said to the monks from the west: "Have you so far not
taken leave from Sāriputta?"


They replied: "We have so far not taken leave from him."


The Buddha said to the monks from the west: "Sāriputta genuinely
cultivates the holy life. You should respectfully take leave from him.
This will enable you to benefit and be at peace for a long time."


Then the monks from the west, being discharged, wished to leave. The
venerable Sāriputta was then sitting under a solid tree not far away
from the Buddha. The monks from the west approached the venerable

65 Although the indication that they wanted to spend the rains retreat in the West is not
made in [[SN22.2]] (or in [[EA41.4]]), such information is given in the commentary Spk
II 256,10.

Sāriputta, paid respect with their heads at his feet, withdrew to sit at
one side, and said to the venerable Sāriputta:


"We wish to return to the west for the rains retreat. Therefore we have
come to take our leave respectfully."


Sāriputta said: "Have you so far not taken leave from the Buddha?"

They replied: "We have already taken leave from him." [66]


Sāriputta said: "Returning to the west and being in various places in
different countries, with various types of different communities, you
will certainly be asked questions. Having now heard the well spoken
Dharma from the Blessed One, you should receive it well, remember
it well, contemplate it well, and enter into it well.


"Is it sufficient to enable you to teach and declare it to others completely, without misrepresenting the Buddha? On being closely questioned by those communities, will this not make you be rebuked and
fall into an occasion of being defeated?"


The monks said to Sāriputta: "We have approached the venerable one
in order to hear the Dharma. May the venerable one explain it to us
completely, out of compassion."


The venerable Sāriputta said to the monks: "The people of Jambudīpa
are clever and with sharp faculties. Be they warriors, or brahmins, or
householders, or recluses, they will certainly ask you: 'What is the
teaching given by your great teacher? With what instruction does he
instruct you?'


"You should answer: 'The great teacher just teaches the disciplining of
desire and lust, with this instruction he instructs us.'


"They may ask you again: 'In relation to what phenomena does one
discipline desire and lust?'


66 In [[SN22.2]] at SN III 6,14 and [[EA41.4]] at T II 745c11 the monks inform Sāriputta of
this without being asked.

"You should again answer: 'The great teacher just teaches the disciplining of desire and lust for bodily form, the disciplining of desire
and lust for feeling … perception … formations … consciousness.
Such are the teachings given by our great teacher.'


"They may ask you again: 'What is the fault in desire and lust, wherefore the great teacher teaches the disciplining of desire and lust for
bodily form, the disciplining of desire and lust for feeling … perception … formations … consciousness?'


"You should again answer: 'If desire for bodily form has not been
abandoned, lust for it has not been abandoned, craving for it has not
been abandoned, [fondly] thinking of it has not been abandoned, thirst
for it has not been abandoned, when that bodily form changes, when it
becomes otherwise, worry, sorrow, [34a] vexation, and pain arise.
Feeling … perception … formations … consciousness _is also like this_ .


"Because of seeing such a fault in desire and lust, therefore desire and
lust for bodily form are to be disciplined, desire and lust for feeling …
perception … formations … consciousness are to be disciplined.'

abandoned, wherefore the great teacher teaches the disciplining of

"Venerable ones, if because of experiencing unwholesome states one
would dwell happily in the present, without pain, without being obstructed, without vexation, without fever, and on the breaking up of

Since experiencing unwholesome states one dwells painfully in the
present, being obstructed, feverish, and vexed, and on the breaking up
of the body, with the end of life, one will fall into an evil realm, therefore the Blessed One says: 'You should abandon unwholesome states',
and [he teaches] the cultivation of the holy life in the Buddha's

# 109. [Discourse on the Tip of a Hair] [70]

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.


At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: "It is just as if there
were a water pond that is fifty leagues ( _yojana_ ) in each direction and
of similar depth, and it were full of water. Again, a person with a hair
or with a blade of grass or with a fingernail takes a drop of that water. [71] Monks, which do you think is more, that person's drop of water
or the water in the pond?"


The monks said to the Buddha: "The drop of water taken by that person with a hair or with a blade of grass or with a fingernail is little,

[34b] so little it is not enough to be spoken about. The water in the
pond is very much, a hundred, a thousand, a ten-thousand times more,
it cannot be compared."

"In the same way, [72] monks, like that pond water is the manifold _duk_ _kha_ that has been abandoned by one who has seen the truth, it will
never arise again in the future." [73]


At that time the Blessed One, having given this teaching, entered into
his hut to sit in meditation. Then the venerable Sāriputta was seated in
the assembly. After the Blessed One had gone and entered his hut,

[Sāriputta] said to the monks:


"I have never before heard the simile of the pond that the Blessed One
so well spoke today. Why is that? A noble disciple who is endowed
with the vision of the truth gains the fruit of right comprehension
( _abhisamaya_ ). If the common folk has wrong view, that has its basis

arises through identity view, and emerges through identity view. That
is, being covered by and experiencing worry and sorrow, they [still]
celebrate and cherish it, call it a self, call it a living being, call it outstanding, special, and hold it to be superior.


"In this way this multitude of wrongness has all been completely
given up and eradicated, removed at its root; like a plantain tree it will
not arise again in the future.


"Monks, what is the multitude of wrongness [mentioned] above which
the noble disciple, who has seen the truth, has abandoned, and which
will never arise again in the future? A foolish unlearned worldling

sense of being owned by it], the self as being in bodily form, or bodily

incorporated presentations that in the Pāli tradition are only found in later texts and
commentarial literature; cf. also Anālayo 2010a.

# 110. [Discourse to Saccaka] [85]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Vesālī by
the side of the Monkey Pond. In the country of Vesālī there was a son
of the Nigaṇṭhas who was intelligent and clever, skilled at understanding any doctrine. He was proud of his intelligence and of his refined
knowledge of vast collections of doctrines and their subtle details.
When giving teachings to assemblies, he surpassed all debaters and he
kept on thinking:


"Among recluses and Brahmins I am unrivalled, able to debate even
with a Tathāgata. On [merely] hearing my name, any kind of debater
will have sweat pouring forth from his forehead, armpits, and the
pores of his hair. Debating a matter, I am [like a strong] wind that is

able to flatten grass and trees, break up metal and stone, and subdue
serpents and elephants, what to say of any kind of debater among humans being able to equal me?" [86]


Then a monk by the name of Assaji, having put on the [outer] robe
and taken his bowl in the morning, entered the town to beg food with
awe-inspiring and decorous behaviour, walking calmly and with eyes
lowered. At that time Saccaka, the son of the Nigaṇṭhas, who owing to
some small matter was going to the villages, was coming out of the
town gate and saw from afar the monk Assaji. [87] He approached him
and asked: "What teachings does the recluse Gotama give to his disciples, what are the teachings with which he instructs his disciples for
their practice?" [35b]


Assaji replied: "Aggivessana, the Blessed One instructs his disciples
with teachings for them to train accordingly in this way, saying:
'Monks, bodily form should be contemplated as being not self, feeling … perception … formations … consciousness should be contemplated as being not self. Make an effort to contemplate the five aggregates of clinging as a disease, as a carbuncle, as a thorn, as a killer, as
impermanent, as _dukkha_, as empty, as not self'." [88]


On hearing these words, the mind of Saccaka, the son of the Nigaṇṭhas,
was not delighted and he said: [89] "Assaji, you certainly heard wrongly,


86 [[MN35]] at MN I 227,18 introduces a similar set of presumptions as public claims
made by Saccaka. The introductory narration of [[EA37.10]] at T II 715a29 does not
provide a description of Saccaka, hence it has these presumptions neither as reflections nor as public claims made by Saccaka. Notably, later on [[SA110]] also considers
these as public claims; cf. below page 50.

87 [[MN35]] and [[EA37.10]] neither describe the inspiring and calm manner in which Assaji
went begging, nor do they indicate that Saccaka had some matter to attend to.

88 Assaji's reply in [[MN35]] at MN I 228,10 does not bring in the characteristic of _dukkha_,
only mentioning impermanence and not-self. In [[EA37.10]] at T II 715b4, however, his
reply covers all three characteristics, indicating that each aggregate is impermanent,
what is impermanent is unsatisfactory, and what is unsatisfactory is not-self.

89 According to [[EA37.10]] at T II 715b10, Saccaka was so displeased that he covered his
ears with his hands and told Assaji: "Stop, stop!".

Gotama does speak like this, then this is a wrong view and I shall approach him, argue with him, and closely interrogate him, so as to stop
him [from speaking like this]."


At that time Saccaka, the son of the Nigaṇṭhas, approached the villages. He told the Licchavis, who had gathered in the assembly hall of
the Licchavis:


"Today I met a foremost disciple of the recluse Gotama by the name
of Assaji and we had a small debate on a matter. According to what he
has told me, I shall approach that recluse Gotama and, debating the
matter with him, I will certainly make him advance, retreat, and turn
around according to my wish.


"It is just as a man mowing grass might pull out the grass at its roots
and, grabbing the stalks with his hand, shake it in the air to get rid of
any dirt. In the same way I shall debate that matter with the recluse
Gotama, argue with him, and closely interrogate him, taking hold of
what is essential and making him advance, retreat, and turn around
according to my wish, getting rid of his mistaken assertions.


"[Or] it is just as, in a liquor shop, someone might take a liquor filter
and press it, to get pure wine and to get rid of the residual grains. In
the same way I shall approach the recluse Gotama, debate and argue
with him, [91] closely interrogate him, taking hold of the pure essence
and making him advance, retreat, and turn around, getting rid of any
mistaken assertions.

mat in the market, will wash it with water to get rid of any smell or

that matter with him, taking hold of what is essential, making him advance, retreat, and turn around, getting rid of any tainted assertions.


"[Or] it is just as if a master elephant trainer in a king's household
were to lead a large and drunken elephant into deep water to wash its
body, the four limbs, ears, trunk, washing it all round to get rid of any
dust or dirt. [92] In the same way I shall approach the recluse Gotama,
debate and argue that matter with him, closely interrogate him, make
him advance, retreat, and turn around according to my free will, taking
hold of the main points and getting rid of any dirty assertions. [93] Licchavis, you may come with me to see how he will be defeated."


Among the Licchavis there were some who spoke like this: "That
Saccaka, the son of the Nigaṇṭhas, should be able to [hold his ground]
in debating that matter with the recluse Gotama, that is not possible."
Others said: "Saccaka, the son of the Nigaṇṭhas, is intelligent and of
sharp faculties, he will be able to [hold his ground] in debating that
matter." [35c]


Then Saccaka, the son of the Nigaṇṭhas, together with five-hundred
Licchavis, approached the Buddha for the purpose of debating the
matter.


At that time the Blessed One was seated under a tree in the Great
Wood for the day's abiding, while many monks were outside of the

[monastic] dwelling, practising walking meditation in the forest. They
saw from afar that Saccaka, the son of the Nigaṇṭhas, was coming.


He gradually approached the monks and asked them: "Where is the
recluse Gotama staying?"

93 [[MN35]] at MN I 228,29 also has four similes, which describe dragging a sheep by its
hair, dragging a brewer's sieve around, shaking a brewer's strainer, and an elephant
who plays in water. The images of dragging a sheep by its hair and of an elephant
that plays in water recur in [[EA37.10]] at T II 715b20, which besides these two has one
more simile of two strong men that take hold of a weak third man and roast him over
a fire.

The monks answered: "He is [seated] under a tree in the Great Wood
for the day's abiding."


Saccaka, the son of the Nigaṇṭhas, approached the Buddha, paid respect and, after exchanging greetings, sat at one side. The Licchavi
householders also approached the Buddha, some of them paid respect,
others held their hands with palms together [in homage], exchanged
greetings and, having exchanged greetings, stood at one side. [94]


Then Saccaka, the son of the Nigaṇṭhas, said to the Buddha: "I have
heard that Gotama gives such teachings and such instructions to his
disciples, instructing his disciples to contemplate bodily form as being
not self, to contemplate feeling … perception … formations … consciousness as being not self; making an effort to contemplate the five
aggregates of clinging as a disease, as a carbuncle, as a thorn, as a
killer, as impermanent, as _dukkha_, as empty, as not self.' [95]


"Does Gotama teach in this way or does this report misrepresent
Gotama? Is this said as it was said or is it not said as it was said? Is
this said according to the Dharma, is it said in accordance with the
Dharma, so that there is nothing causing one to fall into an occasion of
being defeated in a situation of being argued with and closely
interrogated by another person who has come?" [96]


The Buddha told Saccaka, the son of the Nigaṇṭhas: "What you have
heard is said as it was said, it is said according to the Dharma, it is
said in accordance with the Dharma, it is not a misrepresentation and
there is nothing causing one to fall into an occasion of being defeated
on being argued with and closely interrogated. Why is that?


94 While [[EA37.10]] does not record the behaviour of the Licchavis at all, [[MN35]] at MN
I 229,27 describes an even broader variety of behaviour, with some of the Licchavis
announcing their name and others just remaining silent, though all of them sit down.

95 Instead of reporting what he had heard from Assaji, in [[MN35]] at MN I 230,1 and [[EA37.10]] at T II 715c10 Saccaka asks the Buddha the question he had earlier asked Assaji (with some minor differences in wording in [[EA37.10]]).

96 Adopting the variant 人 instead of 忍.

_Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 103 to 110 45


"I truly give such teachings to my disciples, I truly continuously instruct my disciples, so that in conformity with my teaching and instruction they contemplate bodily form as being not self … feeling …
perception … formations … consciousness as being not self, and contemplate these five aggregates of clinging as a disease, as a carbuncle,
as a thorn, as a killer, as impermanent, as _dukkha_, as empty, as not
self."


Saccaka, the son of the Nigaṇṭhas, said to the Buddha: "Gotama, I
shall now speak a simile."


The Buddha told Saccaka, the son of the Nigaṇṭhas: "Know that it is
the proper time for it."


[Saccaka said]: "It is just as whatever is done in the world all depends
on the earth, in the same way bodily form is a person's self, from
which good and evil arise, feeling … perception … formations …
consciousness is a person's self, from which good and evil arise. [97]


"Again, just as in the realm of humans, [or] in the realm of [earthen]
spirits, herbs, grass, trees, and woods all depend on the earth for their
arising and growth, in the same way bodily form is a person's self,
feeling … perception … formations … consciousness is a person's
self."


The Buddha said [36a]: "Aggivessana, do you say that bodily form is
a person's self, that feeling … perception … formations … consciousness is a person's self?"


He replied: "It is like this, Gotama, bodily form is a person's self, feeling … perception … formations … consciousness is a person's self –
and this whole assembly says the same."


The Buddha said: "Aggivessana, just keep to your own doctrine.

[What] is the use of bringing in the people in the assembly?"


97 [[EA37.10]] at T II 715c18 differs from the other two versions in so far as here the issue
at stake is whether bodily form, etc., are permanent or impermanent, so Saccaka affirms that the aggregate of bodily form is permanent. The progression of this part in
[[EA37.10]] is substantially different from the other versions.

Saccaka, the son of the Nigaṇṭhas, said to the Buddha: "Bodily form is
truly a person's self."


The Buddha said: "Aggivessana, I shall now question you, answer me
according to your understanding. It is just as the king of a country who
in his own country can put to death a man who has committed a crime,
or bind him, or expel him, or have him be whipped and his hands and
feet cut off; and if someone has done a meritorious deed, [the king can]
grant him the gift of an elephant, a horse, a vehicle, a town, or wealth

- could he not do all that?" [98]


He answered: "He could do it, Gotama."


The Buddha said: "Aggivessana, whoever is the owner, would he not
be totally free to do anything he likes?" [99]


He answered: "It is like this, Gotama."


The Buddha said: "Aggivessana, you say that bodily form is a person's
self, that feeling … perception … formations … consciousness is a
person's self, [but] are you able, in accordance with your wish, freely,
to have them be like this, [or] not be like this?"


Then Saccaka, the son of the Nigaṇṭhas, remained silent.


The Buddha said: "Aggivessana, come now and speak, come now and
speak. Why do you remain silent?"


In the same way for three times Saccaka, the son of the Nigaṇṭhas,
remained silent as before.


Then a powerful thunderbolt spirit, holding a thunderbolt, fierce and
blazing with fire, staying in the empty space close above the head of
Saccaka, the son of the Nigaṇṭhas, said this: "The Blessed One has


98 [[MN35]] at MN I 231,4 illustrates the king's power by bringing in the examples of
King Pasenadi and King Ajātasattu, differing from [[SA110]] also in not taking up the
positive case of rewarding those who have done something positive.

99 This additional inquiry, driving home the implication of the simile on the king, is
without a counterpart in [[MN35]]


On the Five Aggregates (5)－A Translation of
_Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 103 to 110 47


asked you three times. Why do you not reply? With this thunderbolt I
shall break your head into seven pieces!" [100]


Owing to the Buddha's supernormal power, only Saccaka, the son of
the Nigaṇṭhas, saw the thunderbolt spirit; the rest of the assembly did
not see it. [101] Saccaka, the son of the Nigaṇṭhas, became greatly afraid
and said to the Buddha: [102] "No, Gotama."


The Buddha said: "Aggivessana, pay steady attention and reply after
having understood it. Earlier in this assembly you proclaimed that
bodily form is the self, that feeling … perception … formations …
consciousness is the self, yet now you say it is not so. The earlier and
the latter contradict each other. You earlier kept on saying: 'Bodily
form is the self, feeling … perception … formations … consciousness
is the self.' [103] Aggivessana, now I will ask you: Is bodily form permanent or is it impermanent?"

He answered: "It is impermanent, Gotama." [104]


100 The intervention of this spirit is similarly reported in [[MN35]] at MN I 231,30 and [[EA37.10]] at T II 716a7, a minor difference being that in the Pāli version he appears before the Buddha repeats his question a third time, whereas in the two Chinese versions he takes action once the third repetition of the question has not met with a reply.
On the threat that an opponent's head will split to pieces in ancient Indian literature
cf., e.g., La Vallée Poussin 1932, Hopkins 1932: 316, Insler 1989/1990, and Witzel
1987.

101 [[MN35]] at MN I 231,35 agrees with [[SA110]] that only Saccaka and the Buddha could
see the spirit, without, however, indicating that this was due to the Buddha's supernormal power. In [[EA37.10]] at T II 716a10 Saccaka apparently at first did not notice
the spirit and only realizes what is happening when the Buddha tells him to look up
into the sky.

102 When describing Saccaka's fear, [[MN35]] at MN I 232,1 indicates that he was seeking
from the Buddha protection, shelter, and refuge; cf. also [[EA37.10]] at T II 716a13.

103 Instead of reminding him of the position he earlier took, in [[MN35]] at MN I 232,4 the
Buddha takes up each aggregate individually and inquires about the possibility to
control it, in each case concluding that the reply Saccaka gives does not square with
what he upheld before.

104 [[MN35]] at MN I 232,37 proceeds similarly, differing from [[SA110]] in that it does not
refer to the well-taught noble disciple. In [[EA37.10]] however, at this point the Buddha points out that even a wheel-turning king will grow old. A counterpart to the
teachings given at present in [[SA110]] and [[MN35]] on the true nature of the five aggregates occurs only later in [[EA37.10]] at T II 716b25.

[The Buddha] asked again: "What is impermanent, is it _dukkha_ ?"


He answered: "It is _dukkha_, Gotama."


[The Buddha] asked again: "What is impermanent, _dukkha_, and of a
nature to change, would a learned noble disciple herein see it as the
self, as distinct from the self [in the sense of being owned by it], as
existing [within the self, or the self] as existing [within it]?"


He answered: "No, Gotama."

Feeling … perception … formations … consciousness _should also be_
_spoken like this_ .


The Buddha said: "Aggivessana, you [should] attend well and then
speak." [36b]


[The Buddha] asked again: "Aggivessana, if one is not free from lust
in regard to bodily form, not free from desire for it, not free from

[fondly] thinking about it, not free from craving for it, not free from
thirst in regard to it, if that bodily form changes, if it becomes otherwise, will sadness, sorrow, vexation, and pain arise?" [105]


He answered: "It is like this, Gotama."

Feeling … perception … formations … consciousness _should also be_
_spoken like this_ .


[The Buddha] asked again: "Aggivessana, if one is free from lust in
regard to bodily form, free from desire for it, free from [fondly] thinking about it, free from craving for it, free from thirst in regard to it, if
that bodily form then changes, if it becomes otherwise, will sadness,
sorrow, vexation, and pain not arise?"


He answered: "It is like this, Gotama; this is true and not otherwise."


Feeling, perception, formations and consciousness _should also be_
_spoken like this_ .


105 This argument is not found in [[MN35]] although it occurs in other Pāli discourses, cf.,
e.g., [[SN22.84]] at SN III 107,5.


On the Five Aggregates (5)－A Translation of
_Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 103 to 110 49


[The Buddha said]: "Aggivessana, it is just like a person whose body
is afflicted by various types of pain, being constantly accompanied by
pain, pain that does not cease, does not go away. Will [this person] be
able get delight from that?" [106]


He answered: "No, Gotama."


[The Buddha said]: "It is like this, Aggivessana. A [person whose]
body is afflicted by various types of pain, being constantly accompanied by pain, suffering pain does not cease, does not go away, will not
be able get delight from that.


"Aggivessana, it is just as if a person in search of solid heartwood
were to enter a mountain, carrying an axe. On seeing a very large and
perfectly straight plantain tree, he cuts it at the root and removes the
sheaths, taking off the skin, until nothing is left. [He would find that it
is] totally without a solid essence. [107] Aggivessana, you are also like
that. Your self-established arguments have come to an end, I have
now properly searched for their true and real essence. They are totally
without solid essence, like a plantain tree.


"Yet, among this assembly you dared to make the declaration: 'I do
not see, among recluses or Brahmins who possess knowledge and possess vision, [even] a Tathāgata, an arahant, a fully awakened one who
possesses knowledge and possesses vision, who is able to take part in
debating a matter without being shattered and defeated [by me].'


"You also said of yourself: '[When] debating a matter, I am [like a
strong] wind that flattens grass and trees, breaks up metal and stones,
and subdues serpents or elephants, I am certainly able to cause others
to have their sweat pour forth from their forehead, armpits, and the
pores of their hair.' Now you have not established your own doctrine
and your own matter, [although] at first you boasted of being able to


106 In [[MN35]] at MN I 233,9 the Buddha instead points out that someone who regards as
self what in reality is _dukkha_ will not be able to transcend _dukkha_ .

107 This simile has a counterpart in [[MN35]] at MN I 233,15, although it is absent from [[EA37.10]] The Buddha's subsequent reminding Saccaka of his earlier boasting, however,
is reported in all three versions.


50 法鼓佛學學報第 15 期（2014）


subdue the modes of [thought of] others. Now you have reached your
own [wits'] end and you have not been able to stir a single hair of the
Tathāgata."


At that time the Blessed One, in that great assembly, took off his upper robe and bared his chest, [saying]: "Try to see if you could stir a
single hair of the Tathāgata!" [108]


At that time Saccaka, the son of the Nigaṇṭhas, lowered his head in
silence, pale and ashamed.


At that time in the assembly there was a Licchavi named Dummukha,
who got up from his seat, arranged his clothes and, holding his hands
with palms together [in respect] towards the Buddha, said: "Blessed
One, allow me to speak a simile."


The Buddha said: "Dummukha, know that it is the proper time for it."


Dummukha said to the Buddha: "Blessed One, it is as if a person were
to take just a peck-sized or ten-peck-sized [container] in order to gather twenty or thirty pecks from a great heap of grains. Now this Saccaka, the son of the Nigaṇṭhas, is just like that. [36c]


"Blessed One, it is as if a householder of great wealth and much treasure were to commit a transgression out of neglect, due to which all his
wealth [is confiscated] and taken to the king's household. Saccaka, the
son of the Nigaṇṭhas, is just like that, his ability at arguing has been
completely taken away by the Tathāgata. [109]


"It is as if there was a big pond alongside a town or village. Men and
women, young and old, are all playing in the water and, having caught
a crab in the water, cut off its legs and then put it on the dry ground.
Because of having no legs, it is unable to go back into the big pond.


108 In [[MN35]] at MN I 233,35 and [[EA37.10]] at T II 716b5 the Buddha uncovers his upper
body in order to show that he is not sweating, unlike Saccaka. In a record of this episode in T 1509 at T XXV 251c16, (trsl. Lamotte 1970: 1666) the point of the
Buddha's baring his chest is also to show the absence of sweat.

109 This and the previous simile are not found in [[MN35]] or [[EA37.10]] which only have
counterparts to the next simile of the crab.


On the Five Aggregates (5)－A Translation of
_Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 103 to 110 51


Saccaka, the son of the Nigaṇṭhas, is also like that. All his ability at
arguing has been completely cut off by the Tathāgata, he will never
again dare to approach the Tathāgata and challenge him to debate a
matter."


At that time, Saccaka, the son of the Nigaṇṭhas, was angry and upset.
He upbraided the Licchavi Dummukha, [110] saying: "You are rude and
impolite! Not having investigated the truth, why are you yapping? I
am discussing with the recluse Gotama myself. Will you mind your
own business?"


Having upbraided Dummukha, Saccaka, the son of the Nigaṇṭhas, in
turn said to the Buddha: "Let be that ordinary low-level kind of talk.
Now I have another question." [111]


The Buddha told Saccaka, the son of the Nigaṇṭhas: "Feel free to ask,
I will answer in accordance with your question."


[Saccaka asked]: "Gotama, how do you give teachings to your disciples so that they become free from doubt?"


The Buddha said: "Aggivessana, I tell my disciples: 'Whatever bodily
form, whether past, future or present, internal or external, gross or
subtle, sublime or repugnant, far or near, it should all be contemplated
as it really is as not self, as not distinct from the self [in the sense of
being owned by it], as not existing [within the self, nor a self] as existing [within it].' Feeling … perception … formations … consciousness
… _is also like this_ .


"Training [like this] they will certainly come to see the path and not
abandon it or let it come to ruin, being able to achieve dispassion,
knowledge, and vision, [thereby] taking hold of the door to the deathless. Even though they do not all attain the supreme, yet they [all]


110 Adopting the variant 呵 instead of 唾.

111 The section beginning with the present question, up to Saccaka’s admission of defeat,
is without counterpart in [[EA37.10]] which instead reports how the Buddha teaches
Saccaka the true nature of the five aggregates.


52 法鼓佛學學報第 15 期（2014）


move towards Nirvāṇa. [112] A disciple who is taught the Dharma by me
in this way reaches freedom from doubt."


[Saccaka] asked again: "Gotama, how do you further instruct your disciples so that in the Buddha's teaching they attain the destruction of
the influxes, the influx-free liberation of the mind and liberation by
wisdom, here and now personally knowing and realizing: 'Birth for me
has been eradicated, the holy life has been established, what had to be
done has been done, I myself know that there will be no receiving of
further existence?"


The Buddha said: "Aggivessana, by properly employing this [same]
teaching: 'Whatever bodily form, whether past, future or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, sublime or repugnant, far or near, it
should all be contemplated as it really is as not self, as not distinct
from the self [in the sense of being owned by it], as not existing [within the self, nor a self] as existing [within it].' Feeling … perception …
formations … consciousness … _is also like this_ .


"At the time of [contemplating like this], they accomplish three unsurpassable qualities [37a]: unsurpassable knowledge, unsurpassable
awakening, and unsurpassable liberation. [113] Having accomplished
these three unsurpassable qualities, they honour the great teacher,
esteem, and worship him as a Buddha: 'The Blessed One has realized
all teachings, and with these teachings he tames his disciples so that
they attain peace, so that they attain fearlessness, are tamed, at peace,
and [attain] the ultimate, Nirvāṇa. For the sake of Nirvāṇa the Blessed
One gives teachings to his disciples.'


"Aggivessana, in this teaching my disciples attain the destruction of
the influxes, attain liberation of the mind, attain liberation by wisdom,
here and now personally knowing and realizing: 'Birth for me has
been eradicated, the holy life has been established, what had to be

113 Adopting the variant readings 道無上 and 解脫無上 for the second and third item;
cf. also Yìnshùn 1983: 212 note 5.


On the Five Aggregates (5)－A Translation of
_Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 103 to 110 53


done has been done, I myself know that there will be no receiving of
any further existence."


Saccaka, the son of the Nigaṇṭhas, said to the Buddha: "Gotama, it is
just as if one might escape from a strong man recklessly wielding a
sharp sword, [but] from the debating skills of Gotama it is difficult to
escape. As if one might avoid a poisonous snake, or avoid a vast
swamp or a fierce fire, or one might escape from a fierce drunken elephant, or from a mad and hungry lion; from all these one might escape,

[but] from the debating skills of Gotama it is difficult to find an escape. [114] It is not for me, a commoner, impetuous, and a lowly man,
not endowed with debating skill, to come and call on Gotama for the
sake of debating a matter.


"Recluse Gotama, this country of Vesālī is pleasant and prosperous.
There are the Cāpāla shrine, the Sattambaka shrine, the Bahuputta
shrine, the *Gotama-nigrodha shrine, the *Sāradhāra shrine, *Dhurānikkhepana shrine, and the *Balaratana shrine. [115]


"May the Blessed One feel at ease in this country of Vesālī, may the
Blessed One always receive worship, respect, and offerings from _de-_
_va_ s, Māras, Brahmās, recluses, Brahmins, and anyone else in the
world, so that these _deva_ s, Māras, Brahmās, recluses, and Brahmins
for a long time may be in peace. May he stay here, and with the great
congregation [of monks] may he accept my humble food offering
tomorrow morning." [116]


114 [[MN35]] at MN I 236,3 has three similes, which describe reaching safety after attacking an elephant, a fire, or a snake. [[EA37.10]] at T II 716c7 only describes a fierce lion
who is not afraid on seeing a man coming.

115 My attempt to reconstruct the names of the shrines is conjectural.

116 The listing of shrines and Saccaka's wish for the Buddha to be at ease and respected
are not reported in the parallel versions. Whereas [[MN35]] at MN I 236,12 instead directly proceeds to the invitation for a meal, according to [[EA37.10]] at T II 716c12
Saccaka at this point takes refuge. Some degree of conversion appears to be also
implicit in [[SA110]] since in the present passage Saccaka no longer addresses the
Buddha as "recluse Gotama", 沙門瞿曇, as he did earlier, this being a mode of
address used in the early discourses by outsiders. Instead, in the present passage
Saccaka employs the honorific address 世尊, corresponding to _bhagavant_ and
indicative of the respectful attitude a disciple has towards the Buddha.


54 法鼓佛學學報第 15 期（2014）


At that time, the Blessed One accepted by [remaining] silent. Then
Saccaka, the son of the Nigaṇṭhas, knowing that the Buddha, the
Blessed One, had accepted the invitation by [remaining] silent, rejoiced, and was delighted and thrilled. He rose from his seat and left.


At that time, while Saccaka, the son of the Nigaṇṭhas, was on his way

[back], he said to the Licchavis: "I have invited the recluse Gotama
and a great congregation [of monks]. [Let us] supply the meal together.
Each of you prepare one dish of food and send it to my place." [117]


The Licchavis each returned to their homes, made preparations during
the night and in the morning sent [the food] to the place of Saccaka,
the son of the Nigaṇṭhas. In the morning Saccaka, the son of the Nigaṇṭhas, swept [his place], sprinkled water [on the floor], set out seats,
and prepared clean water [for washing]. He sent a messenger to the
Buddha to announce that the time [for the meal] had arrived. [37b]


At that time the Blessed One, together with a great company [of
monks], put on his robes, took his bowl, and approached the place of
Saccaka, the son of the Nigaṇṭhas. He sat in front of the great company. Saccaka, the son of the Nigaṇṭhas, with his own hand respectfully served pure beverages and food, sufficient for the great company.

[When] they had eaten and completed washing their bowls, Saccaka,
the son of the Nigaṇṭhas, knowing that the Buddha had finished eating
and had completed washing his bowl, took a low seat and sat before
the Buddha.


At that time, the Blessed One spoke the following verses as a thanksgiving to Saccaka, the son of the Nigaṇṭhas: [118]


117 [[MN35]] at MN I 236,16 and [[EA37.10]] at T II 716c18 proceed similarly, although without Saccaka giving specific indications as to how much each Licchavi should prepare.

118 Instead of listening to a set of verses by the Buddha, in [[MN35]] at MN I 236,33 Saccaka wishes to share the merit of his offering with the Licchavis and is then told by the
Buddha that the Licchavis will receive the merit to be gained by giving to one not
free from defilements, like Saccaka, whereas Saccaka himself will receive the merit
to be gained by giving to one free from defilements, like the Buddha, after which
[[MN35]] ends. In [[EA37.10]] at T II 716c29, the Buddha gives a gradual teaching at the


On the Five Aggregates (5)－A Translation of
_Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 103 to 110 55


"The [performance of the] fire sacrifice
Is foremost among all great gatherings.


The Sāvitthī is foremost
Among treatises and higher scriptures. [119]


The king is foremost among men,
The ocean is foremost of all rivers.


The moon is foremost of all stars,
The sun is foremost in brilliance.


Among gods and men in the ten directions
A fully and rightly awakened one is foremost."


At that time the Blessed One taught the Dharma in various ways to
Saccaka, the son of the Nigaṇṭhas. Having instructed, taught, illuminated, and delighted him, he returned to his former dwelling place.


Then the monks, being together as a group on the road [back], were
discussing this matter: "The five-hundred Licchavis each prepared
food and drinks for Saccaka, the son of the Nigaṇṭhas. What merit
have the Licchavis gained, what merit has Saccaka, the son of the
Nigaṇṭhas, gained?"


At that time, [when] the monks had returned to their own residence,
put away their robes and bowls, and washed their feet, they approached the Blessed One, paid respect with their heads at his feet,
withdrew to sit at one side, and said to the Buddha:


"Blessed One, on our way back we discussed this matter together:
'The five-hundred Licchavis prepared the food and drinks for Saccaka,
the son of the Nigaṇṭhas, which he offered to the Blessed One and the
great company [of monks]. What merit have the Licchavis gained,
what merit has Saccaka, the son of the Nigaṇṭhas, gained?'"


end of which Saccaka attains stream-entry, at which point the Buddha delivers a set
of verses similar to those found in [[SA110]]

The Buddha told the monks: "The Licchavis prepared beverages and
drinks for Saccaka, the son of the Nigaṇṭhas, so they obtained merit in
dependence on Saccaka, the son of the Nigaṇṭhas. Saccaka, the son of
the Nigaṇṭhas, obtained merit [in dependence] on the virtues of the
Buddha. The Licchavis obtained the fruits in dependence on giving to
one who has desire, anger, and delusion. Saccaka, the son of the Nigaṇṭhas, obtained the fruits in dependence on giving to one who is free
from desire, anger, and delusion."

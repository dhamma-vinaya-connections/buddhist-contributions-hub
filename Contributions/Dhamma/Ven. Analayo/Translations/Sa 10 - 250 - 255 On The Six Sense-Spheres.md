# On the Six Sense-spheres (3) — A Translation of Saṃyukta-āgama Discourses 250 to 255＊

Bhikkhu Anālayo


Professor, Numata Center for Buddhist Studies


University of Hamburg, Germany

### Introduction

In this article I translate the second half of the ninth fascicle of
the _Saṃyukta-āgama_, which contains discourses 250 to 255. [1]


＊ 2019/7/6 收稿，2019/9/28 通過審稿。

1 The translated text is found at T II 60a22 to 64b15, which is the second

part of the ninth fascicle in the Taishō edition corresponding to the ninth

fascicle in the reconstructed order of this collection. In what follows, my

identification of Pāli parallels is based on Akanuma 1929/1990 and

Yìnshùn 1983, in the case of Sanskrit fragment parallels I am indebted to

Chung 2008. Here and elsewhere, I adopt Pāli for proper names and

doctrinal terms in order to facilitate comparison with the Pāli parallels,

except for terms like Dharma and Nirvāṇa, without thereby intending to

take a position on the original language of the _Saṃyukta-āgama_ manu
script used for translation.

## 250) [2]

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at
Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Feeding Place.

At that time the venerable Sāriputta and the venerable
Mahākoṭṭhita were staying together on Mount Vulture Peak.

After rising from meditation in the afternoon, the venerable
Mahākoṭṭhita approached the venerable Sāriputta and, having
exchanged friendly greetings, sat back to one side. He said to
Sāriputta: “I would like to ask a question. Would you have free
time to show me the answer?”

The venerable Sāriputta said to Mahākoṭṭhita: “Friend, on
knowing what you are asking, I shall reply accordingly.”

The venerable Mahākoṭṭhita asked the venerable Sāriputta:
“How is it venerable Sāriputta, is the eye a bondage for forms
or are forms a bondage for the eye?” [60b]

“[ _In the same way for_ ] the ear and sounds … the nose and
odours … the tongue and flavours … the body and tangibles …
is the mind a bondage for mental objects or are mental objects


2 Parallel: [[SN35.191]] at SN IV 162,23.


On the Six Sense-spheres (3) — A Translation of _Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 250 to 255  141

a bondage for the mind?” [3]

The venerable Sāriputta replied to the venerable Mahākoṭṭhita:
“The eye is not a bondage for forms and forms are not a
bondage for the eye … _up to_ …the mind is not a bondage for
mental objects and mental objects are not a bondage for the
mind. Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita, if between them there is desire
and lust, that is their bondage.”

“Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita, it is just like two oxen, one black
and one white, which are yoked together and bound to a single
yoke. A person asks: ‘Is the black oxen a bondage for the white
oxen or is the white oxen a bondage for the black oxen?’ Are
these appropriate questions?”

[Mahākoṭṭhita] replied: “No, venerable Sāriputta. The black
oxen is not a bondage for the white oxen and the white oxen is
also not a bondage for the black oxen. But if between them
there is a yoke, if they are yoked together, that is the bondage
by which they are bound.”


3 The translation is based on dropping an additional reference to “the mind

and mental objects”, 意法, which occurs before the phrase “the mind is

not a bondage for mental objects …” and can clearly be identified as a

copyist mistake.


142 正觀第九十期/二 Ο 一九年九月二十五日

[Sāriputta said]: “In the same way, venerable Mahākoṭṭhita, the
eye is not a bondage for forms and forms are not a bondage for
the eye … _up to_ … the mind is not a bondage for mental
objects and mental objects are not a bondage for the mind. The
desire and lust between them, that is their bondage.

“Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita, if the eye were a bondage for forms
or forms were a bondage for the eye … _up to_ … if the mind
were a bondage for mental objects or mental objects were a
bondage for the mind, then the Blessed One would not [be able
to] teach people and establish them in the holy life to attain the
eradication and making an end of _dukkha_ . Because the eye is
not a bondage for forms and forms are not a bondage for the
eye … _up to_ … the mind is not a bondage for mental objects
and mental objects are not a bondage for the mind, therefore
the Blessed One [is able to] teach people and establish them in
the holy life to attain the eradication and making an end of
_dukkha_ .

“Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita, if the Blessed One sees with the eyes
forms that are beautiful or ugly, he does not give rise to desire
and lust. If other living beings see with the eyes forms that are
beautiful or ugly, then they give rise to desire and lust. [4] For this


4 [[SN35.191]] does not take up the case of how average living beings react to

six sense-experience.

reason the Blessed One teaches that one should abandon desire
and lust so that the mind is liberated … _up to_ … the mind and
mind-objects _is also like this_ .”

Then the two worthy ones were mutually delighted and returned to their respective places.

## 251) [5]

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at
Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Feeding Place.

At that time the venerable Sāriputta and the venerable
Mahākoṭṭhita were staying together on Mount Vulture Peak.

After rising from meditation in the afternoon, the venerable
Mahākoṭṭhita approached the venerable Sāriputta and, having
exchanged friendly greetings, sat back to one side. He said to
the venerable Sāriputta: “I would like to ask a question. Would
you have free time to show me the answer?”

The venerable Sāriputta said: “Friend, on knowing what you


5 Akanuma 1929/1990: 42 mentions [[MN43]] as a parallel, which is not

correct; cf. Anālayo 2011: 268 note 19. For a similar exchange between

Mahākoṭṭhita and Sāriputta that instead takes up the topic of ignorance

from the viewpoint of insight into the five aggregates see [[SA256]]


144 正觀第九十期/二 Ο 一九年九月二十五日

are asking, I shall reply accordingly.”

The venerable Mahākoṭṭhita asked the venerable Sāriputta:
“One is said to be ignorant; how is one ignorant?”

The venerable Sāriputta said: “This is being said about not
understanding. [60c] One who does not understand is ignorant.
What does one not understand? That is, one does not understand as it really is that the eye is impermanent. This is called
not understanding. One does not understand as it really is that
the eye is of a nature to arise and cease. This is called not
understanding. The ear … the nose … the tongue … the
body … the mind _are also like that_ .

“In this way, venerable Mahākoṭṭhita, not understanding as
they really are these six spheres of contact, not seeing them,
not comprehending them, being bewildered by them, [6] ignorant
in relation to them, and greatly obscured by them, this is called
ignorance.”

The venerable Mahākoṭṭhita again asked the venerable Sāriputta: “One is said to be knowledgeable; how is one
knowledgeable?”


6 The translation is based on adopting the variant 癡 instead of 闇.


On the Six Sense-spheres (3) — A Translation of _Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 250 to 255  145

The venerable Sāriputta said: “This is being said about understanding. One who understands is knowledgeable. What
does one understand? That is, the eye is impermanent and one
understands as it really is that the eye is impermanent; the eye
is of a nature to arise and cease, and one understands as it
really is that the eye is of a nature to arise and cease. The
ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind _are also_
_like that_ .

“Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita, understanding as they really are
these six spheres of contact, seeing them, being knowledgeable
in regard to them, realizing them, awakening to them, having
wisdom about them, and comprehending them, this is called
knowledge.”

Then the two worthy ones, having heard what had been said,
were mutually delighted and returned to their respective places.

146 正觀第九十期/二 Ο 一九年九月二十五日

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at
Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Feeding Place.

At that time a monastic by the name of Upasena was dwelling
in Rājagaha in a cemetery in the Cool Grove, in Kaliṅga’s
walking place below the Snake’s Hood Cave. At that time the
venerable Upasena was alone and sitting inside in meditation.

At that time there was an evil poisonous snake, about one foot
long, that from above a rock had fallen in between and on
Upasena’s body. Upasena called out to Sāriputta: “Tell the
monastics that a poisonous snake has fallen on my body; my
body has been poisoned. You should come quickly, take my
body out and place it outside. Let this body not fall apart inside,
like a heap of rotten chaff.”


quotation in the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_, T 1442 at T XXIII 656c8 and

[[DN3]] _cha_ 124b1 or Q 1032 _che_ 109b3; cf. also Schmithausen 1997: 11ff.

[[SN35.69]] corresponds to the first part of [[SA252]] up to Upasena’s death.

[[AN7.54]] correspond to the report given to the Buddha of Upasena’s death

and his ensuing deliverance of protective verses. Although [[AN7.54]] does

not give the name of the monastic who died from snake bite and does not

mention Sāriputta, it seems quite possible that it refers to the same event

as reported in [[SN35.69]] even though, as already noted by Waldschmidt

1957: 30 note 4, the two Pāli discourses are allocated to different venues

([[SN35.69]] takes place in Rājagaha, [[AN7.54]] in Sāvatthī).


On the Six Sense-spheres (3) — A Translation of _Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 250 to 255  147

At that time the venerable Sāriputta was staying under a tree
close by. Hearing the words of Upasena, he approached
Upasena and said to Upasena: “Now that I observe your
appearance, your faculties are not different from usual. Yet you
say: I have been poisoned, take my body out, let it not fall apart

[inside] like a heap of rotten chaff. Actually, how are you?”

Upasena said to Sāriputta: “If someone should say: ‘I am the
eye, it is me, it is mine; [I am] the ear … the nose … the
tongue … the body … the mind; the ear … the nose … the
tongue … the body … the mind is me, it is mine, [8] [I am]
forms … sounds … odours … flavours … tangibles … mental
objects; forms … sounds … odours … flavours … tangibles …
mental objects are me, they are mine;

“[I am] the earth element, the earth element is me, it is mine; [I
am] the water … the fire … the wind … the space … the consciousness element, the water … the fire … the wind … the
space … the consciousness element is me, it is mine; [61a] [I
am] the bodily form aggregate, the bodily form aggregate is me,
it is mine; [I am] the feeling tone … perception … formations … consciousness aggregate; the feeling tone …
perception … formations … consciousness aggregate is me, it


8 [[SN35.69]] at SN IV 40,29 only takes up the six senses, not their objects,

the elements, or the aggregates.


148 正觀第九十期/二 Ο 一九年九月二十五日

is mine; such a one’s facial expression and faculties should
change. Now I am not like that. The eye is not me, it is not
mine … _up to_ … the consciousness aggregate is not me, it is
not mine. For this reason, my facial expression and faculties do
not change.”

Sāriputta said: “It is like that, Upasena, thus for a long time you
have been apart from [notions of] ‘me’ and ‘mine’ and from
the underlying tendency to being bound by attachment to the
conceit ‘I am’, you have cut them off at the root, like cutting
down a Palmyra tree, never to rise up again in future. How
could your facial expression and faculties change?”

Then Sāriputta circumambulated Upasena and took his body
outside of the cave. Upasena’s poisoned body fell apart like a
heap of rotten chaff. [9] Then Sāriputta spoke in verse:

“One who has developed this holy life for a long time,
And well cultivated the noble eightfold path
Lets go of life with joy
Similar to giving up a bowl with poison.

“One who has developed this holy life for a long time,


9 [[SN35.69]] concludes with his passing away, after the monastics have taken

out his body.


On the Six Sense-spheres (3) — A Translation of _Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 250 to 255  149

And well cultivated the noble eightfold path
Lets go of life with joy
Like a person recovering from a serious disease.

“One who has developed this holy life for a long time,
And well cultivated the noble eightfold path
Is without sorrow and regret at the approach of death
Like someone who exits a house that is on fire.

“One who has developed this holy life for a long time,
And well cultivated the noble eightfold path
Contemplates the world with wisdom
As similar to weeds, grass, and trees.
One does not further search for something else;
What remains will also not continue.” [10]

Then the venerable Sāriputta, having done the reverential
duties towards the corpse of Upasena, approached the Buddha,
paid respect with his head at [the Buddha’s] feet, and sat back
to one side. He said to the Buddha: “Blessed One, a poisonous
snake, as small as a chip for [administering] eye ointment, fell
on the body of the venerable Upasena and his body fell apart


10 Waldschmidt 1957: 34 note 1 draws attention to an apparent parallel

verse in Nidd I 438,28: _tiṇakaṭṭhasamaṃ lokaṃ, yadā paññāya passati,_

_nāññaṃ patthayate kiñci, aññatra appaṭisandhiyā_ .


150 正觀第九十期/二 Ο 一九年九月二十五日

like a heap of rotten chaff.”

The Buddha said to Sāriputta: “If Upasena had recited these
verses, then he would not have become poisoned and his body
would not have fallen apart like a heap of rotten chaff.”

Sāriputta said to the Buddha: “Blessed One, what verses should
he have recited? What is their wording?”

The Buddha recited for Sāriputta the verses: [11]

“I have constant thoughts of _mettā_ in relation to those
Dhataraṭṭha [snakes]
I have _mettā_ for the Erāvaṇa [snakes],
The Chabyāputta [snakes].
And the Kambalassatara [snakes].
I also have _mettā_ for the Kakkoṭaka [snakes] [61b]
And for the Dark Gotama [snakes],
The Nandas and the Upanandas. [12]

“I have _mettā_ and compassion for footless ones,


11 For Sanskrit reconstructions of the proper names of the snakes mentioned

cf. Waldschmidt 1957: 35. [[AN7.54]] at AN II 72,22+29 mentions the

_virūpakkha_, _erāpatha_, _chabyāputta_, and _kaṇhāgotamaka_ snakes.

12 The translation is based on adopting the variant 陀 instead of 徒.


On the Six Sense-spheres (3) — A Translation of _Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 250 to 255  151

And for those with two feet,
With four feet, and also with many feet,
I have aroused _mettā_ and compassion for all of them. [13]

“I have _mettā_ and compassion for all snakes,
Those that are in water and on land.
I have _mettā_ for all living beings
Towards those who have fear and those free from fear. [14]

“May they all be at ease and happy
And be free from giving rise to vexations.
I wish to make them all become virtuous
Let them all not give rise to what is evil.

“Those who dwell regularly in the Snake’s Hood Cave,
May they not gather manifold evils.
The terribly harmful and venomous snakes
Are able to harm the life of living beings.


13 [[AN7.54]] at AN II 72,31 continues with the wish not to be harmed by

footless ones, two-footed ones, four-footed ones, and those with many

feet. Then it contrasts the boundlessness of the Buddha, the Dharma, and

the Community to the finiteness of snakes, etc., avers that a protection

has been made and thus creatures should retreat, and concludes with

homage to the seven Buddhas.

14 The translation is based on adopting the variant 畏 instead of 量.


152 正觀第九十期/二 Ο 一九年九月二十五日

“Truthful words like this
Were spoken by the unsurpassable great teacher.
I now practice recitation of these
Truthful words of the great teacher.

“[May] all venoms
Be unable to harm my body.
Lustful desires, anger, and delusion,
Are the three poisons in the world.
The three venoms are like this.

“One who has forever abandoned them is called the jewel of
the Buddha.
The jewel of the Dharma extinguishes the manifold poisons.
The jewel of the Community also destroys without remainder
The terrible venom and wholesome persons receive full
protection.
The Buddha has smashed all poisons;
Snake poison, you shall now be smashed.

“For this reason, the words of this _dhāraṇī_ should be spoken as
follows: _wùdānpólì dānpólì dānlù_ [15] _bōpódānlù nàidì sùnàidì_
_zhǐbádì wénnàyí sānmóyí tándì níluózhǐshī póluójūbì wùlì_


15 Adopting the variant 躭 instead of 航.

_wùyúlì xībōhē_ . [16]

“Sāriputta, had the good clansman Upasena at that time spoken
these verses, spoken these words, the snake would not have
been able to poison his body and his body would not have
fallen apart like a heap of rotten chaff.”

Sāriputta said to the Buddha: “Blessed One, Upasena had never
heard these verses, he had never heard the words of this
_dhāraṇī_ . One should in future properly lend ear to what the
Blessed One has now spoken.”

Hearing what the Buddha had said, the venerable Sāriputta was
delighted, paid respect, and left.

## 253) [17]

Thus have I heard. At one time the venerable Udāyin, who was
travelling among the people in the country of Kosala, [61c] had
arrived at the village Kāmaṇḍa and was staying in the mango


16 The Sanskrit fragment version of this _dhāraṇī_, Waldschmidt 1957: 41,

reads: _otuṃbile tuṃbile tuṃbe pratuṃbe naṭṭe sunaṭṭe kevaṭṭe munaye_

_samaye datte nīlakeśe vālakupe ole oṅko svāhā._

17 Parallels: [[SN35.133]] at SN IV 121,17 and Sanskrit fragments in

Waldschmidt 1980 and SHT IX 3121, Wille and Bechert 2004: 355.

grove of a brahmin lady of the *Veṇukaccāyana clan. [18]

At that time young disciples of the brahmin lady of the
*Veṇukaccāyana clan were roaming around to gather
firewood. [19] They arrived at the mango grove and saw the
venerable Udāyin seated under a tree with graceful appearance,
with tranquil faculties, the mind truly at peace, being one who
is accomplished in the foremost taming. Having seen him, they
approached him and, having exchanged friendly greetings, sat
back to one side.

Then Udayin taught the youths the Dharma in various ways.
Having inspired them, he remained silent. Hearing what the
venerable Udāyin had said, those youths rejoiced and were
delighted. They rose from their seats and left.

Then the youths, carrying bundles of firewood, returned to the


18 T II 61c1: 毘紐迦旃延, which following Waldschmidt 1980: 71 suggests

an original corresponding to Sanskrit Veṇukātyāyana; Chung 2008: 79

note 15 gives Veṇukātyāyanasagotrī. The corresponding term in [[SN35.133]] is Verahaccāni (although the grove rather belonged to the

brahmin Todeyya according to [[SN35.133]] at SN IV 121,19); for a Tibetan

counterpart to the name cf. Skilling 2000: 347 and Horiuchi 2013: 361

note 9.

19 [[SN35.133]] at SN IV 121,20 speaks only of a single brahmin youth.


On the Six Sense-spheres (3) — A Translation of _Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 250 to 255  155

brahmin lady of the *Veṇukaccāyana clan, placed the bundles
of firewood on the ground, approached the brahmin lady of the
*Veṇukaccāyana clan, and said: “Our senior lady, please know
that the recluse Udāyin of the Gotama clan is in the mango
grove and dwells in reliance on it; he is very skilled at teaching
the Dharma.”

The brahmin lady of the *Veṇukaccāyana clan said to the
youths: “You could approach the recluse Udayin of the Gotama clan and invite him for tomorrow to take his meal here.”

Then, having received the instruction by the brahmin lady of
the *Veṇukaccāyana clan, the young disciples approached the
venerable Udāyin. They said to Udāyin: “Venerable, please
know that our senior, the brahmin lady of the *Veṇukaccāyana
clan, invites the venerable Udāyin to take his food tomorrow
from her.” Then Udāyin accepted the invitation by remaining
silent.

Then those youths, knowing that Udāyin had accepted the
invitation, returned again to their senior, the brahmin lady of
the *Veṇukaccāyana clan, and said: “Senior lady, on account
of what our senior lady had said, we have invited the venerable
Udāyin. The venerable Udāyin has accepted the invitation by

remaining silent. May the senior lady know herself the [proper]


156 正觀第九十期/二 Ο 一九年九月二十五日

time for it.”

At that time the venerable Udāyin, when the night was over at
dawn, put on his robes, took his bowl, and approached the
house of the brahmin lady of the *Veṇukaccāyana clan. Then,
on seeing from afar that the venerable Udāyin was coming, the
brahmin lady of the *Veṇukaccāyana clan quickly set out a seat
and invited him to sit on it. She supplied a variety of foods and
drinks, offering with her own hand abundant and fine [food] to
satisfy him fully. When he had eaten, rinsed his mouth, and
completed washing his bowl, he returned to his former seat.

Then the brahmin lady of the *Veṇukaccāyana clan, knowing
that the meal had been completed, put on fine leather sandals,
covered her head with a cloth, set up a separate high seat that
manifested the characteristic of disrespect and, [62a] sitting on
it proudly, she said to Udāyin: [20] “I would like to ask a question.
Would you have free time to show me the answer?”

Udāyin replied: “Sister, now is not the time for that.” Having
said this, he rose from his seat and left.


20 [[SN35.133]] does not add an explanation that (according to ancient Indian

customs) her behaviour was characteristic of disrespect and pride. Her

inquiry in [[SN35.133]] at SN IV 122,21 is considerably less polite, as she

just says: “Speak Dharma, recluse!”


On the Six Sense-spheres (3) — A Translation of _Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 250 to 255  157

In this way, the next day the disciples again went to the mango
grove to gather firewood and listen to the Dharma. On returning they again told the senior lady. The senior lady again sent
them to invite him for the meal. As earlier it happened three
times, up to the request for a teaching and the reply: “It is not
the time.” He did not teach her the Dharma.

The young disciples again told the senior lady that the recluse
Udāyin, who is in the mango grove, is very skilled at teaching
the Dharma. The senior lady replied: “I indeed understood that
he is very skilled at teaching the Dharma. I have invited him
three times to come and supplied him with food to hear the
Dharma. He keeps saying it is not the time and leaves without
teaching.”

The disciples said to the senior lady. “You put on fine leather
sandals, cover your head with a cloth, and take a disrespectful
seat. How could he teach? Why is that? Because of his respect
for the Dharma, the venerable Udāyin left without teaching
you.”

The senior lady replied: “If it is like this, invite him again on
my behalf.”


158 正觀第九十期/二 Ο 一九年九月二十五日

Having received the instruction, the disciples again invited him
for a [food] offering and [everything happened] as earlier. Then,
knowing that the meal had been completed, the senior lady
removed her leather sandals, adjusted her clothing and moreover sat on a low seat. She said respectfully: “I would like to
ask a question. Would you have free time to show me the
answer?” [21]

Udāyin replied: “It is suitable for you to ask now. I will explain
it to you.”

She asked: “There are recluses and brahmins who teach that
pleasure and pain are wrought by oneself. There are others who
teach that pleasure and pain are wrought by others. There are
still others who teach that pleasure and pain are wrought by
oneself and others. There are still others who teach that
pleasure and pain are wrought neither by oneself nor by others.
Venerable, how is this?”


21 In [[SN35.133]] at SN IV 123,29 she asks her question directly, without

requesting first permission. Her question is what arahants designate as the

required condition for the existence of pleasure and pain and for their

cessation, without any reference to teachings by some recluses and

brahmins on this topic. Thus [[SN35.133]] takes up the perspective of

dependent arising and cessation together, whereas [[SA253]] first covers

dependent arising and after that only turn to its cessation.


On the Six Sense-spheres (3) — A Translation of _Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 250 to 255  159

The venerable Udāyin replied: “Sister, arahants teach the
arising of pleasure and pain differently, they do not teach it like
this.”

The brahmin lady asked again: “What is the meaning of this?”

Udāyin replied: “Arahants teach: ‘pleasure and pain arise from
these conditions’.”

[The brahmin lady asked again: “From which conditions do
pleasure and pain arise?”] [22]

Udāyin further said to the brahmin lady: “I will now ask you,
answer me according to your understanding. What do you think,
does the eye exist?”

She replied: “It exists.”


22 The supplementation is guided by the fact that the otherwise relatively

similar Sanskrit fragment version has a corresponding question at this

juncture; cf. Waldschmidt 1980: 73 §6: _yathā kathaṃ śramaṇ(a-_

_pratītyasamutpannaṃ_ _arhantaḥ_ _sukhaduḥkhaṃ_ _prajñapayaṃti)_ ?

“Recluse, how do arahants designate the dependent arising of pleasure

and pain?”


160 正觀第九十期/二 Ο 一九年九月二十五日

[Udāyin said]: “Do forms exist?”

She replied: “They exist.”

[Udāyin said]: “Do eye-consciousness, eye-contact, and feeling
tone arisen in dependence on eye-contact and experienced
within, be it painful, pleasant, or neutral, exist?”

She replied: “It is like this, venerable Udāyin.”

Udāyin asked her again: “Do the ear … the nose … the
tongue … the body … the mind … mind-contact, [23] and feeling
tone arisen in dependence on mind-contact and experienced
within, be it painful, pleasant, or neutral, exist?”

She replied: [62b] “It is like this, venerable Udāyin.”

Udāyin said: “This is what arahants teach: ‘pleasure and pain
arise from these conditions’.”

The brahmin lady said: “Venerable Udāyin, is it in this way
that arahants teach that pleasure and pain arise from these
conditions?”

Udāyin replied: “It is in this way, brahmin lady.” [24]

The brahmin lady asked again: “Recluse, what do arahants
teach to be the conditions for the cessation of arisen pleasure
and pain?” [25]

Udāyin replied: “I will now ask you, answer me according to
your understanding. Brahmin lady, when the eye ceases
completely, totally, without a remainder, would there still be
feeling tone arisen in dependence on eye-contact and ex

24 [[SA253]] stands alone in having a change of address here, with Udāyin

shifting from “sister” to “brahmin lady” and her reply shifts from

“venerable Udāyin” to “recluse”. In the Pāli and Sanskrit versions he

keeps addressing her as “sister”; in the Pāli she addresses him during

their discussion as “venerable sir”, but in the Sanskrit fragment version

she keeps using “recluse” (which she had used earlier in the Pāli version

when acting disrespectfully) even after her attainment of stream-entry.

25 The translation here and in Udāyin’s final reply is based on deleting a

reference to what is “neutral”, 不苦不樂, as the discussion concerns

pleasure and pain and this reference could easily be due to a copying

error influenced by the preceding passage that takes up the three types of

feeling tone. The reconstructed Sanskrit fragment version refers only to

pleasure and pain at this juncture; cf. Waldschmidt 1980: 74 §13: _(yathā_

_kathaṃ śramaṇa arhantaḥ sukhaduḥkha)sy(a) nirodhaṃ prajñapayaṃti_

_ni(rodhaṃ)_ in Udāyin’s reply) _._

perienced within, be it painful, pleasant, or neutral?”

She replied: “No, recluse.”

[Udāyin asked her again]: “In the same way, when the ear …
the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind ceases
completely and is forever eradicated without a remainder,
would there still be feeling tone arisen in dependence on mindcontact and experienced within, be it painful, pleasant, or
neutral?”

She replied: “No, recluse.”

[Udāyin said]: “Brahmin lady, it is in this way that arahants
teach the conditions for the cessation of arisen pleasure and
pain.”

When the venerable Udāyin gave this teaching, the brahmin
lady of the *Veṇukaccāyana clan attained the pure eye of
Dharma that is remote from [mental] stains and free from

[mental] dust. Then the brahmin lady of the *Veṇukaccāyana
clan saw the Dharma, attained the Dharma, understood the
Dharma, and penetrated the Dharma, she crossed over doubt
without needing to rely on others to enter the Dharma taught by
the Buddha; she had attained fearlessness in the Dharma.

She rose from her seat, adjusted her clothing and, with hands
held together in respect, said to the venerable Udāyin: “Today I
have entered certainty. From today on I take refuge in the
Buddha, take refuge in the Dharma, and take refuge in the
Community. From today on I take refuge in the three jewels for
my whole life.”

At that time Udāyin, having spoken the Dharma to the brahmin
lady, having instructed, taught, illuminated, and delighted her,
rose from his seat and left.

qualities pertinent to awakening. [27]

Then the venerable Soṇa Koḷivīsa, being alone in quiet
meditation, thought: “I am to be counted among disciples of
the Blessed One who are energetic. However, by now I have
not yet [reached liberation] by eradicating the influxes. I am
the son of a reputed clan with much wealth. I could now rather
revert to [lay life], enjoy the five sense pleasures, and widely
practice giving to make merit.”

At that time the Blessed One, knowing what Soṇa Koḷivīsa was
thinking in his mind, said to one monastic: “Approach Soṇa
Koḷivīsa now and tell him: [62c] ‘The Blessed One is calling
you.’” [28]

Having received the instruction from the Buddha, this monastic
approached Soṇa Koḷivīsa and said: “The Blessed One is


27 T II 62b24: 菩提分法, which Waldschmidt 1968: 776 takes to be a

rendering of _bodhyaṅga_ . Yet, the seven awakening factors are usually

referred to in the _Saṃyukta-āgama_ as 七覺分 or even just 七覺, which

makes it more probable that the present reference corresponds to what in

Pāli are known as the _bodhipakkhiyā dhammā_ .

28 According to [[AN6.55]] at AN III 374,19 and several other parallels, the

Buddha rather approached Soṇa by means of levitation; cf. in more detail

Anālayo 2017: 291.


On the Six Sense-spheres (3) — A Translation of _Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 250 to 255  165

calling you.”

Hearing that monastic express the great teacher’s order, Soṇa
Koḷivīsa approached the Blessed One, paid respect with his
head at [the Buddha’s] feet, and sat back to one side.

At that time the Blessed One said to Soṇa Koḷivīsa: “Is it true
that, being alone in quiet meditation, you had the thought: ‘I
am to be counted among disciples of the Blessed One who are
energetic in cultivation, however, by now I have not yet
reached liberation by eradicating the influxes. I am the son of a
reputed clan with much wealth. I could now rather revert to lay
life, enjoy the five sense pleasures, and widely [practice]
giving to make merit?’”

Then Soṇa Koḷivīsa thought: “The Blessed One has come to
know my intentions.” He was startled and afraid, with his hair
standing on ends. He said to the Buddha: “It is true, Blessed
One.”

The Buddha said to Soṇa Koḷivīsa: “I will now ask you, answer
me according to your understanding. Soṇa Koḷivīsa, when you
were in the lay life, were you skilled at playing the lute?”


He replied: “It is like this, Blessed One.”


166 正觀第九十期/二 Ο 一九年九月二十五日

[The Buddha] asked him again: “What do you think? When
you were playing the lute, if the strings were tense, was it able
to produce beautiful and harmonious sound?”

He replied: “No, Blessed One.”

[The Buddha] asked him again: “How is it? If the strings were
lax, could it emit beautiful and harmonious sound?”

He replied: “No, Blessed One.”

[The Buddha] asked him again: “The strings of the lute being
well adjusted, neither tense nor lax, did it after that emit
beautiful and harmonious sound?”

He replied: “It is like this, Blessed One.”

The Buddha said to Soṇa Koḷivīsa: “Effort that is too tense
increases agitation, effort that is too lax leads people into
sluggishness. Therefore, you should take up the practice with
balance, do not become attached, do not become negligent, and
do not cling to signs.” [29]


29 For a comparative survey of several parallel versions to this injunction

given by the Buddha to Soṇa cf. Bodhi 2012: 1763 note 1368.


On the Six Sense-spheres (3) — A Translation of _Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 250 to 255  167

Then, hearing what the Buddha said, the venerable Soṇa
Koḷivīsa rejoiced and was delighted. He paid respect and left.
Then the venerable Soṇa Koḷivīsa was constantly mindful of
the simile of the strings of the lute, taught to him by the
Blessed One. Being alone in quiet meditation … _as stated_
_above up to_ … with the destruction of the influxes his mind
attained liberation and he became an arahant.

At that time the venerable Soṇa Koḷivīsa, having attained

[liberation and become] an arahant, experiencing within the joy
and happiness of liberation, thought: “I should now approach
and politely greet the Blessed One.” [30]

At that time the venerable Soṇa Koḷivīsa approached the
Buddha, paid respect with his head at [the Buddha’s] feet, sat
back to one side, and said to the Buddha: “Blessed One, one
who has become an arahant in the Blessed One’s teaching, who
has eradicated the influxes, has done what had to be done, has
relinquished the heavy burden, has gained his own benefit, has
eradicated the fetters of existence, whose mind with right
understanding has attained liberation, at that time has been

liberated in six dimensions. [31]

“What are the six? They are being liberated by separation from
sensual desire, being liberated by separation from anger, being
liberated by seclusion, [63a] being liberated by the destruction
of craving, being liberated by  separation  from clinging, [32] and
being liberated by having no loss of mindfulness in the mind. [33]

“Blessed One, if someone were to declare being liberated by
separation from sensual desire in dependence on mere faith in
the mind, that is not proper. [34] The destruction of lust, anger,


31 The corresponding passage in [[AN6.55]] at AN III 376,20 speaks of being

“determined”, _adhimutto_, and a Sanskrit fragment parallel, Hoernle

1916/1970: 171 (§6), has also preserved _(a)dhimuktasya_ and _avyāvadhy-_

_adhimuktasya_ .

32 The translation is based on emending 諸取 to read 離取, in accordance

with the reading found at T II 63a8.

33 The six in [[AN6.55]] at AN III 376,20 are being determined on renunciation

( _nekkhamma_ ), seclusion ( _viveka_ ), non-affliction ( _avyāpajjha_ ), the

destruction of craving ( _taṇhakkhaya_ ), the destruction of clinging

( _upādānakkhaya_ ), and non-delusion ( _asammoha_ ).

34 [[AN6.55]] at AN III 376,23 presents what follows as ideas some other

monastic might have about Soṇa, suspecting he might be determined on

renunciation merely out of faith, determined on seclusion merely out of a

wish for gains and fame, and determined on non-affliction merely

because of holding on to rules and observances.


On the Six Sense-spheres (3) — A Translation of _Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 250 to 255  169

and delusion is truly reckoned being liberated by separation
from sensual desire.

“If furthermore someone were to declare having attained and
being liberated by separation from anger in dependence merely
on keeping virtue, that is also not proper. The destruction of
lust, anger, and delusion is truly reckoned being liberated by
separation from anger. [35]

“If furthermore someone were to declare being liberated by
seclusion in dependence on pursuing the gains of seclusion,
that is also not proper. The destruction of lust, anger, and
delusion is truly [reckoned] being liberated by seclusion.

“The destruction of lust, anger and delusion is also reckoned
being separated from craving, it is also reckoned being separated from clinging, and it is also reckoned being liberated by
separation from loss of mindfulness.

“In this way, Blessed One, if monastics have not yet become
arahants, have not yet eradicated the influxes, they do not gain
being liberated in these six dimensions.

“Furthermore, if a monastic is at the level of a trainee and has

not yet gained the superior happiness of Nirvāṇa [but] is
cultivating to proceed to that mental abiding, at that time one is
endowed with the virtue of a trainee and endowed with the
faculties of a trainee. At a later time, such a one will gain the
eradication of the influxes, the influx-free liberation of the
mind … _up to_ … knowing for oneself that there will be no
receiving of a further existence. At that time, one will gain the
virtue of a non-trainee and gain the faculties of a non-trainee.

“It is just like an ignorant small infant that lies facing upwards.
At that time, it is endowed with the faculties of a child. At a
later time, gradually growing up and becoming endowed with
the faculties, at that time it will be endowed with the faculties
of an adult. One who is at the level of a trainee is also like that,
not yet having gained the superior happiness … _up to_ … endowed with the virtue of a non-trainee and the faculties of a
non-trainee.

“If with the eye such a one regularly cognizes forms, these will
never be able to hinder such a one’s liberation of the mind and
liberation by wisdom, because the mind is firmly established
internally, has been cultivated boundlessly and is well liberated,
contemplating their rise and fall … _up to_ … their impermanence. [36]


36 It is not clear what text should be supplemented here. A Sanskrit fragment


On the Six Sense-spheres (3) — A Translation of _Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 250 to 255  171

“[If] with the ear such a one [regularly] cognizes sounds …
with the nose cognizes odours … with the tongue cognizes
flavours … with the body cognizes tangibles … with the mind
cognizes mind-objects, these will not be able to hinder the
liberation of the mind and liberation by wisdom, because the
mind is firmly established internally, has been cultivated
boundlessly and is well liberated, contemplating their rise and
fall.

“It is just like a great rocky mountain near a village or town
that is not broken, not destroyed, not perforated, being entirely
solid and compact. Supposing that winds blow from the four
directions, they are unable to shake it, unable to pass through it.
That non-trainee is also like that. [If] with the eye such a one
regularly cognizes forms … _up to_ … with the mind regularly
cognizes mind-objects, these will not be able to hinder the
liberation of the mind and liberation by wisdom, because the
mind is firmly established internally, has been cultivated
boundlessly and is well liberated, contemplating their rise and

parallel, Hoernle 1916/1970: 170 (§2) proceeds further from contem
plation of fall, but does not lead up to impermanence: _vyaya-dharmam_

_eva samanupaśyati virāga-dharmam_ _eva samanupaśyati ni(rodham eva_

_samanupaśyati partiniḥsarga) eva samanupaśyati_ .


172 正觀第九十期/二 Ο 一九年九月二十五日

At that time, Soṇa Koḷivīsa spoke in verse:

“One is liberated by separation of the mind from sensual
desires
And being without anger, having cast it off as well, [63b]
Being liberated by seclusion of the mind
From lustful cravings forever and without remainder.

“Being liberated by  separation  of the mind from clinging, [37]
And being without loss of mindfulness in the mind,
Fully understanding what manifests in the sensory fields,
By that the mind is liberated.

“That one is liberated in the mind,
Being a monastic whose mind is appeased,
Who has done all that had to be done,
With nothing to do further to be done.

“It is just like a great rocky mountain
Which the four winds are unable to shake.

And mind-objects that are pleasant or repulsive

Are unable to shake such a mind.

“The mind is constantly established and firm,
Truly contemplating their nature of arising and ceasing.” [38]

When the venerable Soṇa Koḷivīsa had spoken this teaching,
the great teacher was pleased in his mind. Hearing what Soṇa
Koḷivīsa had said, all his learned companions in the holy life
were greatly delighted. At that time, rejoicing and delighting in
having heard the teaching taught [to him earlier] by the Buddha,
the venerable Soṇa Koḷivīsa paid respect and left.

At that time the Blessed One, knowing that Soṇa Koḷivīsa had
just left, said to the monastics: “One who is well liberated in
the mind should declare it like this, as Soṇa Koḷivīsa has
declared his [final] knowledge, without elevating oneself and
without putting down others, properly speaking what is
significant, neither like one who increases conceit, nor to gain
importance by praising oneself for having gained a state
beyond [ordinary] persons or else by taking to diminishing
oneself.”

38 Although [[AN6.55]] concludes after its version of Soṇa’s verses, a com
parable expression of approval by the Buddha can be found in Vin I 185,9.


174 正觀第九十期/二 Ο 一九年九月二十五日

Thus have I heard. At one time the venerable Mahākaccāna
was staying in the country of Avantī by the side of the
Shīmótuó river in a cave in a forest at Makkarakaṭa. There was
a brahmin, Lohicca, who respected and honoured him as being
of the nature of an arahant. [40]

At that time, in the morning, the venerable Mahākaccāna put
on his robes and took his bowl to enter the village of Makkarakaṭa to beg for food in consecutive order [from house to
house]. Having returned from begging food [and partaken of it],
he stored away his robes and bowl, washed his feet, and
entered the  cave  to sit in meditation. [41]


39 Parallels: [[SN35.132]] at SN IV 116,29, a quote in the _Abhidharmakośa-_

_bhāṣya_, Pradhan 1967: 30,23 (see also Pāsādika 1989: 26 §35), and a

40 Neither here nor later does [[SN35.132]] establish an already existing

relationship between Lohicca and Mahākaccāna.

41 The translation is based on emending a reference to a “hut”, 室, to

become a “cave”, 窟, on the assumption that the occurrence of the

character 室 in the transcription employed for Makkarakaṭa in the

preceding sentence might have influenced the present passage. Given that

according to the introductory narration and the subsequent narration

Mahākaccāna was staying in a cave, it would be unexpected for him to

enter a “hut” for his daily meditation practice.

Then young disciples of the brahmin Lohicca were roaming
around to collect firewood and arrived by the side of the cave
of venerable Mahākaccāna. Laughingly they said to each other:
“A shaven-headed recluse stays in here. This is a dark person
and not a superior person in the world, yet the brahmin Lohicca
respects and honours him as being of the nature of an arahant.”

Then the venerable Mahākaccāna said to the youths: “Youths,
youths, do not make noise!”

The youths said: “We will stop and dare not speak again.”

Three times it happened like this, as they still spoke and did not
stop it. [42] [63c]

Then the venerable Mahākaccāna went outside the door and
said to the youths: “Youths, youths, do not make noise! I will
now teach you the Dharma, you all just listen to it.”

The youths said: “Agreed, may you teach us the Dharma, we
will listen and receive it.”


42 In [[SN35.132]] at SN IV 117,12 a single admonition by Mahākaccāna

suffices to silence them.


176 正觀第九十期/二 Ο 一九年九月二十五日

At that time the venerable Mahākaccāna said in verse: [43]

“Brahmins of former times,
Cultivating perfect morality,
Attained knowledge of former lives,
Delighting truly in meditation.

“Constantly established in kindness and compassion,
They kept the doors of their faculties shut,
And were disciplined in relation to transgressions of speech;
In former times their conduct was like this.

“Abandoning the foundation of true conduct,

[By now] they keep up a manifestation of hypocrisy.
Guarding [just] their family name, they have become negligent
And follow the domain of the six sense faculties.

“Fasting, dwelling in cemeteries,
Bathing thrice, [44] and reciting the three canons [of the Vedas],
Are for one who does not guard the sense doors
Just like a treasure gained in a dream.


43 The verses in [[SN35.132]] touch on similar themes, although with a number

of differences in detail.

44 The translation is based on adopting the variant 浴 instead of 洛.


On the Six Sense-spheres (3) — A Translation of _Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 250 to 255  177

“With matted hair and clothed in hides or coarse cloth
They have misappropriated virtue. Strewing ashes on their
bodies,
Rough clothes to cover their body,
Holding a stick and carrying a water gourd,
They falsely pose as brahmins
In order to gain profit and support.

“Well guarding the body
Being clean and free from dust,
And not vexing living beings:
This is the path to brahmin-hood.”

At that time the youths became angry and did not delight in it.
They said to the venerable Mahākaccāna: “You are slandering
our canonical scriptures, reviling what has been said in them,
and you are abusing brahmins!” [45]

Carrying their bundles of firewood, they returned to the
brahmin Lohicca. They said to the brahmin Lohicca: “Our
senior, did you know that Mahākaccāna slanders the canonical
scriptures, reviling what has been said in them, and abuses
brahmins?”


45 In [[SN35.132]] they do not state this in front of Mahākaccāna, instead of

which they directly go to inform the brahmin Lohicca.


178 正觀第九十期/二 Ο 一九年九月二十五日

The brahmin Lohicca said to the youths: “Youths, do not say
this! Why is that? Mahākaccāna has for a long time been
esteemed for his morality and virtue. He would not slander the
canonical scriptures, reviling what has been said in them, and
abuse brahmins.” [46]

The youths said: “Our senior, if you do not believe our words,
you could go yourself and see.”

Then the brahmin Lohicca, not believing what the youths had
said, approached Mahākaccāna and, having exchanged polite
greetings and inquiries, sat back to one side. He said to
Mahākaccāna: “Did my young disciples come here?” [64a]

[Mahākaccāna] replied: “They came here.”

[The brahmin Lohicca asked]: “Have you been conversing
together a little?”

[Mahākaccāna] replied: “We have been speaking together.”

The brahmin Lohicca said: “Could you now completely tell me

about the conversation you had with the youths?”

Mahākaccāna told him fully. Then the brahmin Lohicca also
became angry and his mind did not delight in it. He said to
Mahākaccāna: “At first I did not believe what the youths said.
Now Mahākaccāna truly slanders the canonical scriptures,
reviling what has been said in them, and abuses brahmins.” [47]
Having said this, for a short while he remained silent. A
moment later he further said to Mahākaccāna: “Friend, you
said ‘doors’. What are the ‘doors’?” [48]

Mahākaccāna said: “It is well, brahmin, it is well that you ask
in accordance with Dharma. I will now explain to you about
the ‘doors’. Brahmin, the eye is a door by means of which one
sees forms. The ear … the nose … the tongue … the body …
the mind is a door by means of which one cognizes mindobjects.”

The brahmin said: “It is remarkable how Mahākaccāna, on
being asked by me about ‘doors’, has explained those ‘doors’.


47 In [[SN35.132]] at SN IV 119,25 the brahmin Lohicca at this point does not

get angry, but rather right away asks for the significance of not guarding

the sense doors.

48 [[SN35.132]] does not report an exchange on the sense doors as such, as the

brahmin Lohicca right away asks about not guarding them.


180 正觀第九十期/二 Ο 一九年九月二十五日

As Mahākaccāna has spoken about ‘not guarding the doors’,
what is ‘not guarding the doors’?”

Mahākaccāna said: “It is well, brahmin, it is well that you ask
about ‘not guarding the doors’, this is a question in accordance
with Dharma. I will now explain to you about ‘not guarding the
doors’.

“Brahmin, a foolish unlearned worldling, on having seen a
form with the eye, in relation to forms that can be [fondly]
recollected gives rise to the condition of attachment and in
relation to forms that cannot be [fondly] recollected gives rise
to aversion, not being established in mindfulness of the body

is liberation of the mind and liberation by wisdom. Various evil
and unwholesome states arise in one and one does not gain
their eradication without remainder. Being obstructed in relation to liberation of the mind and liberation by wisdom, one
does not gain their fulfilment.

“Because of not gaining the fulfilment of liberation of the mind
and liberation by wisdom, one engages with the body in what is
completely evil without gaining respite and the mind is not
tranquil. Because of not being tranquil, one then is not disciplined in relation to the doors of the faculties, does not guard

them, and does not cultivate them.

“As for the eye and forms, with the ear and sounds … the nose
and odours … the tongue and flavours … the body and tangibles … the mind and mental objects _it is also like this_ .”

The brahmin Lohicca said: “It is remarkable, it is remarkable
how Mahākaccāna, on being asked by me about ‘not guarding
the doors’, has explained to me about ‘not guarding the doors’.
Mahākaccāna, what is called ‘well guarding the doors’?”

Mahākaccāna said to the brahmin: “It is well, it is well that you
are able to ask me about ‘well guarding the doors’. Listen
carefully and pay proper attention, I will now explain to you
the meaning of ‘guarding the doors’.

“A learned noble disciple, on having seen a form with the eye,

recollected, constantly taking hold of the mind and being
established in mindfulness of the body that is boundless,

unwholesome states are extinguished without remainder.

“One gains fulfilment of liberation of the mind and liberation

“As for the eye and forms, with the ear and sounds … the nose

The brahmin Lohicca said: “It is remarkable how Mahākaccāna,
on being asked by me about the meaning of ‘guarding the
doors’, [49] has explained to me the meaning of ‘guarding the

herbs and instead gets ambrosia. I am now like that. Becoming

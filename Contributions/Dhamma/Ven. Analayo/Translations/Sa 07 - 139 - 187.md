       - Date of submission: 2014/12/29; date of review: 2015/6/11.
I am indebted to Mike Running, Shi Syinchen, and Ken Su for their collaboration and
to the journal's proof readers for helpful suggestions.

1 The translated text is found at T II 42c15 to 49a25, this being the seventh fascicle in
the Taishō edition, corresponding to the seventh fascicle in the reconstructed order of
this collection according to, e.g., Choong 2000: 243, Bucknell 2006: 686, and Chung
2008: 23. Yìnshùn 1983, however, places the present and the preceding fascicle at a
considerably later point in his edition, as a result of which [[SA139]] to [[SA187]] in the
Taishō edition correspond to discourses 1791 to 12.873 in his edition. The present
fascicle contains two _Saṃyukta-āgama_ sections: [[SA139]] to [[SA171]] correspond to the
second part of the section on views (the first part of which begins with [[SA130]] in the
previous fascicle), whereas the remaining discourses [[SA172]] to [[SA187]] correspond to
the section on penetrative knowledge. In what follows, my identification of Pāli parallels is based on Akanuma 1929/1990 and Yìnshùn 1983, in the case of Sanskrit
fragment parallels I am indebted to Chung 2008. Here and elsewhere, I adopt Pāli for
proper names and doctrinal terms in order to facilitate comparison with the Pāli parallels, except for terms like Dharma and Nirvāṇa, without thereby intending to take a
position on the original language of the _Saṃyukta-āgama_ manuscript used for translation. My reconstruction of the respective titles is mostly based on Akanuma 1929/1990,
when he does not give a title in his catalogue I have made up a title based on the contents of the discourse; in the case of the same title being repeated I add "first", "second", etc.

# [CONNECTED DISCOURSES ON VIEWS] 139. [First Discourse on Worry, Sorrow, Vexation, and Pain]

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.


At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: "The existence of
what is the cause, by clinging to what, [2] by being fettered and attached
to what, by seeing what as the self, do not yet arisen worry, sorrow,
vexation, and pain arise and already arisen worry, sorrow, vexation,
and pain increase further?"


The monks said to the Buddha: "The Blessed One is the root of the
Dharma, the eye of the Dharma, the foundation of the Dharma. May
he explain this fully. Having heard it, the monks will uphold and
receive it respectfully."


The Buddha said to the monks: "The existence of bodily form is the
cause, by clinging to bodily form, by being fettered and attached to
bodily form, by seeing bodily form as a self, not yet arisen worry,
sorrow, vexation, and pain arise, and already arisen worry, sorrow,
vexation, and pain increase further. Feeling … perception … formations … consciousness _is also like this._


"Monks, what do you think, is bodily form permanent or is it impermanent?"


They replied: "It is impermanent, Blessed One."


[The Buddha] asked again: "What is impermanent, is it _dukkha_ ?"


They replied: "It is _dukkha_, Blessed One."


2 [[SA139]] at T II 42c16 actually reads 何所起, "by the arising of what?", where my
translation here and below assumes that this is another instance of confounding
_utpāda_ with _upāda_, as evident in the rendering of _anupādāya_ as 不起 elsewhere in
the collection; cf. Anālayo 2014: 8 note 17.


On Views and Penetrative Knowledge－A Translation of
_Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 139 to 187 (Fascicle 7) 47


[The Buddha said:] "In this way, monks, what is impermanent is
_dukkha_ . Because there is _dukkha_, with this matter arising, there is
being fettered, being attached, and the view of a self. This causes not
yet arisen worry, sorrow, vexation, and pain to arise, and it causes
already arisen worry, sorrow, vexation, and pain to increase further.
Feeling … perception … formations … consciousness _is also like this._


"Therefore, monks, whatever bodily form, whether past, future or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, [43a] sublime or repugnant,
far or near, it is all not self, not distinct from the self [in the sense of
being owned by it], does not exist [within the self, nor does a self] exist [within it]. This is called right wisdom. Feeling … perception …
formations … consciousness _is also like this._


"Again, what is seen, heard, experienced, cognized, aroused, searched
for, remembered, followed with mental application ( _vitakka_ ), and followed with mental sustaining ( _vicāra_ ), all that is not self, not distinct
from the self [in the sense of being owned by it], does not exist [within the self, nor does a self] exist [within it]. This is called right wisdom.


"If there is the view that a self exists and a world exists, and that the
existence of this world and the existence of another world is permanent, lasting, and unchanging ― all that is not self, not distinct from
the self [in the sense of being owned by it], does not exist [within the
self, nor does a self] exist [within it]. This is called right wisdom.


"If again there is the view that this world and a self do not exist, that
nothing belongs to the self in this world, that the self will not be in the
future and anything belonging to the self will not be in the future ―
all that is not self, not distinct from the self [in the sense of being
owned by it], does not exist [within the self, nor does a self] exist

[within it]. This is called right wisdom.


"Suppose a learned noble disciple examines these six standpoints for
views as not self and not belonging to a self. One who contemplates in
this way abandons doubt in relation to the Buddha, abandons doubt in
relation to the Dharma … in relation to the Community. Monks, this is
called a learned noble disciple who no longer tolerates the undertaking

of a bodily, verbal or mental deed that would lead to the three evil
destinies. Even if he is negligent, the noble disciple is certain to proceed to awakening, within seven existences of going and coming
among _deva_ s and humans he will make an end of _dukkha_ ."


When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha
had said the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.

# 140. [Second Discourse on Worry, Sorrow, Vexa- tion, and Pain]


_The next discourse is also like this, with this difference_ : he abandons
doubt about _dukkha_, its arising, its cessation, and the path.

# 141. [Third Discourse on Worry, Sorrow, Vexation, and Pain]


_The next discourse is also like this, with this difference_ : he abandons
doubt in relation to the Buddha, the Dharma, the Community, and
about _dukkha_, it arising, its cessation, and the path.

# 142. [First Discourse on the View of a Self and What Belongs to the Self] [3]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.


At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: "The existence of
what is the cause, by clinging to what, by being fettered and attached
to what, by seeing what as the self, do not yet arisen I-conceit and

being fettered by attachment to a self and what belongs to a self arise,
and already arisen I-conceit and being fettered by attachment to a self
and what belongs to a self increase further?"


The monks said to the Buddha: "The Blessed One is the root of the
Dharma, the eye of the Dharma, the foundation of the Dharma …" _to_
_be recited fully in the same way up to_ … when the Buddha had spoken
this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monks were
delighted and received it respectfully. [4]

# 143–144. [Second and Third Discourses on the View of a Self and What Belongs to the Self]


_The second and the third discourse are also as above._ [5]

# 145. [Discourse on the Influxes and the Obstruction of Confusion]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.


At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: "The existence of
what is the cause, by clinging to what, [43b] by being fettered and
attached to what, by seeing what as the self, do not yet arisen influxes,
being obstructed by and burning with worry, sorrow, vexation, and
pain arise, and already arisen influxes, being obstructed by and
burning with worry, sorrow, vexation, and pain increase further?"


The monks said to the Buddha: "The Blessed One is the root of the
Dharma, the eye of the Dharma, the foundation of the Dharma …" _to_


4 The different ways to gain right wisdom described in [[SA139]] and to be supplied here
have no counterpart in [[SN22.150]]

# 146. [Discourse on the Three Feelings] [6]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.


At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: "The existence of
what is the cause, by clinging to what, by being fettered and attached
to what, by seeing what as the self, does one revolve in the three
feelings in the world?" [7]


The monks said to the Buddha: "The Blessed One is the root of the
Dharma, the eye of the Dharma, the foundation of the Dharma …" _to_
_be recited fully in the same way in the sequence of the above three_
_discourses._

# 147. [Discourse on the Three Types of Dukkha]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.


At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: "The existence of
what is the cause, by clinging to what, by being fettered and attached
to what, by seeing what as the self, does one revolve in the three

[types of] _dukkha_ in the world?"

and pain. Akanuma 1929/1990: 35 also mentions [[SN35.105]] but since this is based
on the six sense-spheres instead of the five aggregates, it does not seem to be a parallel to the present discourse.

# 148. [Discourse on the Eight Worldly Conditions]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.


At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: "The existence of
what is the cause, by clinging to what, by being fettered and attached
to what, by seeing what as the self, does one revolve in the eight
worldly conditions in the world?"


The monks said to the Buddha: "The Blessed One is the root of the
Dharma, the eye of the Dharma, the foundation of the Dharma …" _to_
_be recited fully in the same way in the sequence of the above three_
_discourses._

# 149. [First Discourse on Feeling Superior] [8]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.


At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: "The existence of
what is the cause, by clinging to what, by being fettered and attached
to what, by seeing what as the self, do living beings have a view like
this and speak like this: 'I am superior, I am equal, I am inferior?'"


The monks said to the Buddha: "The Blessed One is the root of the
Dharma, the eye of the Dharma, the foundation of the Dharma …" _to_
_be recited fully in the same way in the sequence of the above three_
_discourses._


8 Akanuma 1929/1990: 35 mentions [[SN35.108]] as a parallel to the present discourse
(and the next two). Since [[SN35.108]] is based on the six sense-spheres instead of the
five aggregates, it does not seem to be a parallel to [[SA149]] (or to [[SA150]] and [[SA151]]).

# 150. [Second Discourse on Feeling Superior]

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.


At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: "The existence of
what is the cause, by clinging to what, by being fettered and attached
to what, by seeing what as the self, do living beings have a view like
this and speak like this: 'There is someone who is superior to me, there
is someone who is equal to me, there is someone who is inferior to
me?'" [43c]

Dharma, the eye of the Dharma, the foundation of the Dharma …" _to_
_be recited fully in the same way in the sequence of the above three_

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.


At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: "The existence of
what is the cause, by clinging to what, by being fettered and attached

# 152. [Discourse on the View of the Existence of a Self] [9]

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.


At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: "The existence of
what is the cause, by clinging to what, by being fettered and attached
to what, by seeing what as the self, do living beings have a view like
this and speak like this: 'The self, this world and the other world, exist
permanently, are of a lasting and unchanging nature, dwelling at peace
like that?'"


The monks said to the Buddha: "The Blessed One is the root of the
Dharma, the eye of the Dharma, the foundation of the Dharma …" _to_
_be recited fully in the same way in the sequence of the above three_
_discourses._

# 153. [Discourse on No Difference]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.


At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: "The existence of
what is the cause, by clinging to what, by being fettered and attached
to what, by seeing what as the self, do living beings have a view like
this and speak like this: 'In this way myself and another are entirely
not two, not different, no less than that?'" [10]


9 Parallel: [[SN22.151]] at SN III 182,17 and [[SN24.3]] at SN III 204,32. [[SN24.3]] seems the
closer parallel of these two, as its exposition leads up to stream-entry, similar to [[SA139]] and all the subsequent discourses in the _Saṃyukta-āgama_ up to the present one,
whereas in [[SN22.151]] the exposition leads up to full awakening.

10 Adopting the variant 減 instead of 滅.

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.


At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: "The existence of
what is the cause, by clinging to what, by being fettered and attached
to what, by seeing what as the self, do living beings have a view like
this and speak like this: 'There is no [efficacy in] offerings, there is no

[efficacy] in sacrifices, there is no [efficacy] in recitations, there is no
arising in good realms or arising in bad realms as the result of deeds,
there is neither this world nor another world, there is no [obligation
towards] one's mother, there is no [obligation towards] one's father,
there are no [spontaneously arisen] living beings, there are no arahants
in this world who have rightly arrived and rightly advanced who,
knowing themselves this world and that world in the present are fully
established in the personal realization that 'birth for me has been
eradicated, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has
been done, I myself know that there will be no receiving of any further
existence?'" [12]


11 Parallel: [[SN24.5]] at SN III 206,26.

12 After this standard formulation of wrong view, [[SN24.5]] at SN III 206,33 continues
with the remainder of the view that according to [[DN2]] at DN I 55,21 was upheld by
Ajita Kesakambalī, proclaiming that a living being consists merely of the four elements, with nothing that continues beyond death. The parallels to [[DN2]] differ on the
view upheld by Ajita Kesakambalī; cf., e.g., Bapat 1948: 109–112, Basham 1951:
21–23, Vogel 1970: 28–33, Meisig 1987: 144–146, and Macqueen 1988: 153–164.

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in

At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: "The existence of

to what, by seeing what as the self, do living beings have a view like
this and speak like this: [14] 'There is no strength, there is no effort, there
is no strong effort, there is no personal efficacy, there is no personal
effort, there is no personal efficient effort, there is no doing by oneself,
there is no doing by another, there is no doing by oneself and by another; all humans, all living beings, all divine beings are without
expediency, without strength, without power, without effort, without
capability, being destined to be successively transformed by
experiencing pleasure and pain in the six modes of existence?'" [15]


13 Parallel: [[SN24.7]] at SN III 210,1.

14 [[SN24.7]] at SN III 210,1 precedes this with the view that there is no cause or condition
for beings to be defiled or purified. These have their counterparts in [[SA157]] and [[SA158]] cf. below notes 16 and 18. According to [[DN2]] at DN I 53,25, the proclamation
of no cause for beings to be defiled or purified and the present view that denies the
efficacy of effort and affirms purification to come about by transmigration in the six
modes of existence were held by Makkhali Gosāla. As in the case of Ajita Kesakambalī, mentioned above in note 12, the parallels to [[DN2]] vary on what view they
attribute to Makkhali Gosāla (or the others out of the group of six eminent teachers).

15 These six recur as part of the view held by Makkhali Gosāla according to [[DN2]] at
DN I 53,31 and 54,4, with a full exposition given to them in [[AN6.57]] at AN III 383,17
(although here presented as a view held by Pūraṇa Kassapa); cf. also the detailed
exposition in the commentary on [[DN2]] Sv I 162,12, translated in Bodhi 1989: 73–75,
and the discussion of this Ajīvaka tenet in Basham 1951: 243–246.

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in

what is the cause, by clinging to what, by being fettered and attached

this and speak like this: 'All living beings who live in this world will
be annihilated after death, will be destroyed, and will no longer exist.
A human being is a combination of the four great elements, at the time
after the body's death the earth returns to the earth, water returns to the
water, fire returns to the fire, wind returns to the wind, and the faculties consequently proceed to space.


"Four men with a bier as their fifth carry the corpse to the cemetery …
_up to …_ it can be understood that what had not been burnt has been
burnt, and [only] bones of the colour of a pigeon remain. The arrogant
ones, who let [others] know about offerings, and the cunning ones,
who let [others] know about retribution, what they claim to exist is all
deception and falsehood. Whether fools or sages, after their death
another existence is annihilated, destroyed, and no longer exists?"

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.


At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: "The existence of
what is the cause, by clinging to what, by being fettered and attached
to what, by seeing what as the self, do living beings have a view like
this and speak like this: 'It is without causes and without conditions
that living beings lack knowledge and lack vision?"

the Dharma, the eye of the Dharma, the foundation of the Dharma …"

that living beings have knowledge and vision]?'" [21]

# 161. [Discourse on the View of Seven Bodies] [22]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.


At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: "The existence of
what is the cause, by clinging to what, by being fettered and attached
to what, by seeing what as the self, do living beings have a view like
this and speak like this: 'These are the seven bodies, which are not
created, not created by being created, which are not transformed, not
transformed by being transformed, they are not killed, they are not
moved, they are substantial. [23] What are the seven? That is, they are
the earth body, the water body, the fire body, the wind body, pleasure,
pain, and the life faculty.


"These seven types of bodies, which are not created, not created by
being created, which are not transformed, not transformed by being
transformed, they are not killed, they are not moved, they are substantial. They do not alter, do not change, and do not obstruct each other.


"If something is meritorious, if it is evil, if it is meritorious and evil, if
it is painful, if it is pleasant, if it is painful and pleasant, [even] if a
person cuts off [another] person's head, yet this is not a form of coercion in the world.


22 Parallel: [[SN24.8]] at SN III 211,4.

23 The view held by Pakudha Kaccāyana according to [[DN2]] at DN I 56,21 proceeds
similarly, including the reference to not killing, DN I 56,30: _n' atthi hantā vā ghātetā_
_vā_, which is absent from the corresponding passage in [[SN24.8]] at SN III 211,15, but
also found in an exposition of this view in [[MN76]] at MN I 517,27.

"If there is the life faculty and the [other six] bodies, and in between
these seven bodies one puts a knife, [moving] it forth and back, still
one does not harm the life faculty. In that there is no killing and no
killer, no bondage and no one who is bound, no thinking and no
thinker, no teaching and no teacher?'" [24]


The monks said to the Buddha: "The Blessed One is the root of the
Dharma, the eye of the Dharma, the foundation of the Dharma …" _to_
_be recited fully in the same way in the sequence of the above three_
_discourses._

# 162. [Discourse on the View of Acting] [25]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. [44c]


At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: "The existence of
what is the cause, by clinging to what, by being fettered and attached
to what, by seeing what as the self, do living beings have a view like
this and speak like this: 'For one who acts, instructs [someone] to act,
destroys, instructs [someone] to destroy, scorches, instructs [someone]
to scorch, kills, instructs [someone] to kill, harms living beings, steals
the wealth of others, engages in sexual misconduct, knowingly speaks
falsehood, drinks liquor, breaks through a wall or destroys a [door]
lock to steal, turns back on a road [to ambush someone], [26] harms [[AN24]] [[SN24.8]] at SN III 211,19 continues with a detailed cosmological description that
forms part of the view held by Makkhali Gosāla according to [[DN2]] at DN I 54,1; cf.
below note 30. [[MN76]] at MN I 517,31 agrees with [[SN24.8]] in so far as it also combines the doctrine of the seven bodies with such a detailed cosmological description
([[DN2]] instead combines this description with the denial of causality and transmigration in the six modes of existence).

25 Parallel: [[SN24.6]] at SN III 208,18.

26 [[SA162]] at T II 44c5 reads 復道, which elsewhere in the collection seems to have the
meaning of "turning back on a road". My supplementation is guided by the assumption that in the present case this might actually be a mistranslation of an original similar to the Pāli expression _paripanthe_, "in ambush", found at the present juncture in the
parallel [[SN24.6]] at SN III 208,23.

village, harms a city, [27] harms people by using a wheel with extremely
sharp blades to cut, [28] slash, chop, and slice them up, creating a great
heap of flesh, for one who undertakes such practice there is no evil
because of this, and also no incurring of evil. Going along the
southern [bank] of the Ganges river killing and harming, or coming
along the northern [bank] of the Ganges river performing a great
sacrifice, because of that there is no merit or evil and there is no
incurring of merit or evil. Making offerings, disciplining oneself,
protecting [others], acting for the benefit [of others] or for mutual
benefit, with these actions one does not create merit?'"


The monks said to the Buddha: "The Blessed One is the root of the
Dharma, the eye of the Dharma, the foundation of the Dharma …" _to_
_be recited fully in the same way in the sequence of the above three_
_discourses._

# 163. [Discourse on the View on Fourteen Hundred Thousand] [29]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.


At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: "The existence of
what is the cause, by clinging to what, by being fettered and attached
to what, by seeing what as the self, do living beings have a view like
this and speak like this: [30] 'In this there are fourteen hundred thousand
gates to birth [as well as] sixty thousand and six hundred [gates to
birth], five actions, three actions, two actions, one action, and half [[AN27]] The possibilities of harming a village or a city are not mentioned in [[SN24.6]]

28 Adopting the variant 剬 instead of 鈆; cf. also Yìnshùn 1983: 508 note 10.

29 Parallel: [[SN24.8]] at SN III 211,19; cf. also SHT IV 30 h5 and l2, Sander and Waldschmidt 1980: 93 and 96.

30 In [[SN24.8]] at SN III 211,19 this view is only the latter part of a view that also affirms
the seven immutable principles; cf. above note 24.

action, sixty-two pathways, sixty-two minor aeons, one hundred and
twenty hells, one hundred and thirty faculties, [31] thirty-six elements of
lust, [32] forty-nine thousand abodes of dragons ( _nāga_ s), forty-nine
thousand abodes of heavenly birds ( _garuḍa_ ), forty-nine thousand
forms of wrong livelihood for heterodox practitioners, [33] forty-nine
thousand forms of going forth for heterodox practitioners, seven percipient aeons, seven non-percipient aeons, seven [kinds of] demons
( _asura_ ), seven [kinds of] goblins ( _pisāca_ ), seven [kinds of] _deva_ s,
seven [kinds of] humans, seven hundred [kinds of] humans, [34] seven

[kinds of] dreams, seven hundred [kinds of dreams], seven [kinds of]
dangers, seven hundred [kinds of] dangers, seven [kinds of] thoughts,
seven hundred [kinds of] thoughts, six [kinds of] births, ten [kinds of]
progress, and eight stages of a great man.


"In this there are eighty-four thousand great aeons, which fools as well
as the wise come and go through until the complete ending of _dukkha._


31 The listing in [[SN24.8]] shows several differences, for example in the present case at
SN III 211,24 the same items are associated with different numbers, thus the listing
mentions 2,000 faculties and 3,000 hells.

32 [[SN24.8]] at SN III 211,25 instead refers to "thirty-six elements of dust", reading _rajo_ _dhātuyo_, as does [[DN2]] at DN I 54,7. The rendering in [[SA163]] at T II 44c17 as 三十
六貪界 points to an original that combines _dhātu_ instead with _rāga_ . This fits the
suggestion made by Basham 1951: 248 in relation to the Pāli expression that "the
most probable meaning of the phrase seems to us to be 'elements of impurity', or
perhaps 'of passion'."

33 The counterpart to the reference to livelihood here varies in the Pāli sources between
_ājīva_ and _ājīvaka_ : [[SN24.8]] at SN III 211,23 reads _ājīvaka_ °, with _ājīva_ ° found in C [e]
and S [e] and also in the commentary Spk II 344,1, whereas [[DN2]] at DN I 54,5 reads
just _ājīva_ °, also found in the commentary Sv I 163,15, and ° _ājīvaka_ is found in B [e], C [e],
and S [e] . Most translators of these two passages have opted for rendering the phrase as
referring to a livelihood or occupation; cf. Rhys Davids 1899: 72, Neuman 1906/2004:
40, Franke 1913: 57, Woodward 1925/1975: 171, Nyānaponika 1967/2003: 201, and
Walshe 1987: 95. Bodhi 2000: 996, however, takes it to stand for the Ājīvakas, commenting in note 261: "here I part with Spk, which glosses _ājīvaka_ with _ājīvavutti_,
'means of livelihood'"; cf. also the discussion in Basham 1951: 247.

34 Adopting the variant 人 instead of 海, although Yìnshùn 1983: 506 prefers 海. I
adopt the variant reading because this corresponds to the pattern that ensues, where a
reference to seven keeps being followed by seven hundred of the same kind. The
same pattern, although with differences in the actual items, can also be found in the
corresponding passage in [[SN24.8]] at SN III 212,2.


On Views and Penetrative Knowledge－A Translation of
_Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 139 to 187 (Fascicle 7) 63


There is no recluse or brahmin who could proclaim this: 'By constantly upholding morality and undergoing austerities, cultivating the
holy life, I will make unripe action ripen, and abandon already ripe
action.'


"Advancing and retreating [on the path of purification] cannot be known.
One constantly lives with this pain and pleasure, being born and passing
away for a fixed amount [of times]. It is just as if a ball of thread is
hurled into space and gradually comes down until it stays by itself on
the ground. The fixed amount [of times] of one's being born and passing
away in these eighty-four thousand great aeons is just like that?'"


The monks said to the Buddha: "The Blessed One is the root of the
Dharma, the eye of the Dharma, the foundation of the Dharma …" _to_
_be recited fully in the same way in the sequence of the above three_
_discourses_ . [45a]

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.


At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: "The existence of
what is the cause, by clinging to what, by being fettered and attached
to what, by seeing what as the self, do living beings have a view like
this and speak like this: 'Winds do not blow, fires do not burn, waters
do not flow, arrows are not shot, pregnant women do not give birth,
milk does not [come from] pulling [a cow's udder], of the sun and the
moon it cannot be known if they rise or set, if it is bright or dark?" [36]


35 Parallel: [[SN24.1]] at SN III 202,1; cf. also [[SN24.19]] at SN III 217,14 and [[SN24.45]] at
SN III 221,7, which have a presentation similar to [[SA164]] and [[SN24.1]] but differ in
their final parts. Although all three Pāli discourses are close enough to be reckoned
parallels to [[SA164]] the closest parallel is [[SN24.1]]

36 The view in [[SN24.1]] at SN III 202,2 is shorter, it does not mention fire, arrows, and
milk, and in relation to the sun and the moon it only speaks of their rising and setting.

translating this character, the first view propose that "the self and the world are
eternal". Although both formulations make sense, they do not concord with what
follows, hence I assume this to be a textual error in the present discourse. This could
easily have happened during transmission, since the next discourse consistently takes
up "the self and the world".

At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: "For the sake of eradicating impermanent things, one should seek out the great teacher. What
things are impermanent? That is, bodily form is an impermanent thing.
For the sake of eradicating that thing, one should seek out the great
teacher.


Feeling … perception … formations … consciousness _is also like_
_this_ ."


When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha
had said the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.

The Buddha said to the monks: "Although one might still forget about
one's turban burning, one should extinguish and eradicate the thriving
fire of impermanence without remainder. For the sake of eradicating the
fire of impermanence, one should cultivate a phrase of Dharma on the
absence of lust. For the sake of eradicating what impermanent states
should one cultivate a phrase of Dharma on the absence of lust? That is,
one should, for the sake of eradicating impermanent bodily form, cultivate a phrase of Dharma on the absence of lust. For the sake of eradicating impermanent feeling … perception … formations … consciousness
one should cultivate a phrase of Dharma on the absence of lust."

# 186. [Discourse on Tranquillity]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.


At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: "It is just as if a person's turban is burning with fire, what could help him?"


The monks said to the Buddha: "Blessed One, he should arouse supreme desire, zeal, and energy at that time to help him to get it extinguished."


The Buddha said to the monks: "Although one might still forget about
one's turban burning, one should extinguish and eradicate the thriving
fire of impermanence. For the sake of eradicating the fire of impermanence, one should cultivate tranquillity ( _samatha_ ). For the sake of
eradicating what impermanent states should one cultivate tranquillity?
That is, for the sake of eradicating impermanent bodily form one
should cultivate tranquillity. For the sake of eradicating impermanent
feeling … perception … formations … consciousness one should
cultivate tranquillity."


_In this way to be recited in full up to_ : When the Buddha had spoken
this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.


_Just as_ "what is impermanent", _in the same way_ "what is impermanent
and of the past", "what is impermanent and of the future", "what is impermanent and of the present", "what is impermanent and of the past
and the future", "what is impermanent and of the past and the present",
"what is impermanent and of the future and the present", "what is impermanent and of the past, the future, and the present", _[discourse] are_
_also to be recited as above_ .

Just as the eight discourses on "cultivating tranquillity", in the same
way for "cultivating insight", eight discourses are also to be recited as
above.


_Just as the sixteen discourses on_ "one should eradicate", _in the same_
_way for_ "one should understand", "one should vomit out", "one should
extinguish", "one should end", "one should relinquish", "one should
make cease", "one should make disappear", _sixteen discourses_ _are_
_also to be recited for each of these as above._

[The Blessed One said to the monks:] [56]


"It should be understood as it really is that whatever bodily form,
whether past, future or present, internal or external, gross or subtle,
sublime or repugnant, far or near, it all is not self, is not distinct from
the self [in the sense of being owned by it], does not exist [within the
self, nor does a self] exist [within it].


Feeling … perception … formations … consciousness _is also like this._


A learned noble disciple who rightly contemplates in this way gives
rise to disenchantment in relation to bodily form, gives rise to disenchantment in relation to feeling … perception … formations … consciousness. Being disenchanted, he does not delight in it. Because of
not delighting in it, he is liberated. Being liberated he knows and sees:
'Birth for me has been eradicated, the holy life has been established,
what had to be done has been done, I myself know that there will be
no receiving of further existence.'"


When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha
had said the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.

_Just as_ "what is impermanent", [57] _in the same way for_ "what is shaking", "what is revolving", "what is diseased", "what is breaking down",


56 This appears to be the beginning of a new discourse, not related to what comes before; cf. also Yìnshùn 1983: 527, who assigns number 10.993 to this discourse, with
10.992 being the last of the sixteen discourses in the repetition series that comes before.

57 The reference to impermanence is not clear to me, since the preceding discourse did
not mention impermanence.

# 187. [Discourse on One Thing]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.


At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: "Because of being endowed with one thing, one is no longer fit to understand that bodily
form is impermanent, to understand that feeling … perception … formations … consciousness is impermanent. What is that one thing with
which one is endowed? [49a] It is lustful desires.

"Not being endowed with one thing, [60] one is fit to understand that
bodily form is impermanent, to understand that feeling … perception … formations … consciousness is impermanent. What is that one
thing with which one is endowed? It is being endowed with the absence of lustful desires. One who is without the condition of lustful
desires is fit to understand that bodily form is impermanent, is fit to
understand that feeling … perception … formations … consciousness
is impermanent."


When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha
had said the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.

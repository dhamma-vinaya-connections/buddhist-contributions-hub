        - Date of submission: 2013/05/04; date of review: 2013/09/23.

I am indebted to Bhikṣu Kongmu, Bhikṣuṇī Syinchen, and Ken Su for their
collaboration, and to the journal's proof readers for helpful suggestions.

1 The translated section comprises the third fascicle of the Taishō edition of the
_Saṃyukta-āgama_, T II 15b10 to 22b13, corresponding to the third part of the
section on the aggregates according to the reconstructed order of this collection.
My identification of Pāli parallels is based on Akanuma 1929/1990 and Yìnshùn
1983, in the case of Sanskrit fragment parallels I am indebted to Chung 2008;
Tibetan parallels in Śamathadeva's compendium of discourse quotations from the
_Abhidharmakośabhāṣya_ have been identified by Honjō 1984 and are translated by
Dhammadinnā 2013, who in her footnotes covers variations found in the Tibetan
parallels. Here and elsewhere, I adopt Pāli for proper names and doctrinal terms in
order to facilitate comparison with the Pāli parallels, except for terms like Dharma
and Nirvāṇa, without thereby intending to take a position on the original language
of the _Saṃyukta-āgama_ manuscript used for translation. In the case of reproducing
Sanskrit texts from romanized editions, I follow the conventions of the respective
editors (except for capitalization). For discourses 59 to 64 my reconstruction of the
respective titles is based on the _uddāna_ found after discourse 64. In case the same
title applies to more than one discourse, I have added "first", "second", etc., to the
title, which is without support in the respective _uddāna_ [[SN2]] 法鼓佛學學報第13期（民國102年）

_Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 59 to 87 3


# 59. [Discourse on Arising and Ceasing] [2]

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.

At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “There are five
aggregates of clinging. What are the five? They are the bodily form
aggregate of clinging ... the feeling ... the perception ... the formations
... the consciousness aggregate of clinging.

“[Monks], contemplate these five aggregates of clinging, their nature
to arise and cease, that is: ‘This is bodily form, this is the arising
of bodily form, this is the cessation of bodily form; this is feeling
... perception ... formations ... consciousness, this is the arising of
consciousness, this is the cessation of consciousness.’

“What is the arising of bodily form? What is the cessation of bodily
form? What is the arising of feeling ... perception ... formations ...
consciousness? What is the cessation of feeling ... perception ...
formations ... consciousness?

“With the arising of craving and delight, bodily form arises; with the
cessation of craving and delight, bodily form ceases. With the arising
of contact, feeling ... perception ... formations arise; with the cessation
of contact, feeling ... perception ... formations cease. With the arising
of name-and-form, consciousness arises; with the cessation of nameand-form, consciousness ceases.


2 Parallel: Akanuma 1929/1990: 29 lists [[SN22.5]] at SN III 13,28 as a parallel, but the
discourse seems only distantly related to [[SA59]] in as much as both explain how each
of the five aggregates arises and ceases; cf. also the discussion in Vetter 2000: 174.
[[SN22.5]] differs in as much as it sets out on the topic of concentration, which provides
the title for the discourse, indicating that concentration is required for understanding
things as they really are. According to [[SN22.5]] the arising of each aggregate is due
to delight leading to clinging and the remaining links of dependent arising ( _paṭicca_
_samuppāda_ ), wherefore its cessation takes place through the cessation of clinging,
etc.

“Monks, in this way bodily form arises and bodily form ceases, this
is the arising of bodily form and the cessation of bodily form. In this
way feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness arises and
feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness ceases, this is the
arising of feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness and the
cessation of feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness.”

When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, the monks, hearing
what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.

# 60. [Discourse on Not Delighting] [3]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.

At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “There are five
aggregates of clinging. What are the five? That is, they are the bodily
form aggregate of clinging ... the feeling ... the perception ... the
formations ... the consciousness aggregate of clinging.

“It would be well, monks, if you do not delight in bodily form, do
not commend bodily form, do not cling to bodily form, do not attach
to bodily form. It would be well, monks, if you do not delight in
feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness, do not commend
consciousness, do not cling to consciousness, do not attach to
consciousness. Why is that?

“If a monk does not delight in bodily form, does not commend bodily
form, does not cling to bodily form, does not attach to bodily form,
then by not delighting in bodily form his mind attains liberation. In
the same way [if he] does not delight in feeling [15c] ... perception ...


3 Parallel: as in the case of the previous discourse [[SA59]] Akanuma 1929/1990: 29 lists
[[SN22.5]] at SN III 13,28 as a parallel; cf. the comments in note 2 above.

formations ... does not delight in consciousness, [4] does not commend
consciousness, does not cling to consciousness, does not attach to
consciousness, then by not delighting in consciousness his mind
attains liberation.

“If a monk does not delight in bodily form and his mind has attained
liberation ... in the same way [if he] does not delight in feeling ...
perception ... formations ... consciousness and his mind has attained
liberation, [for him] there is no perishing and no [re-]arising, he is
established in balanced equanimity, with right mindfulness and right
comprehension.

“That monk, who understands like this and sees like this, has forever
eradicated the view of the past without a remainder. The view of
the past having been forever eradicated without a remainder, he has
also forever eradicated the view of the future without a remainder.
The view of the future having been forever eradicated without a
remainder, he has also forever eradicated the view of the present
without a remainder and is not attached to anything.

“One who is not attached to anything does not cling to anything in
the whole world. One who does not cling to anything does not seek
for anything. One who does not seek for anything personally realizes
Nirvāṇa, [knowing]: ‘Birth for me has been eradicated, the holy life
has been established, what had to be done has been done, I myself
know that there will be no receiving of further existence.’”

When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, the monks, hearing
what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.


4 My translation follows the suggestion by Yìnshùn 1983: 95 note 1 to delete an
occurrence of "consciousness", 識, found just before the phrase "does not delight in
consciousness", 不樂於識.

# 61. [Discourse on Analysis] [5]

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.

At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “There are five
aggregates of clinging. What are the five? That is, there are the bodily
form aggregate of clinging ... the feeling ... the perception ... the
formations ... the consciousness aggregate of clinging.

“What is the bodily form aggregate of clinging? Whatever bodily
form, all of it is the four elements and the form made out of the four
elements. This is called the bodily form aggregate of clinging.

“Again, that bodily form is impermanent, _dukkha_, and of a nature to
change. If that bodily form aggregate of clinging is forever given up
without a remainder, completely relinquished, ceases, fades away, [6] is
appeased, and disappears, and further [instances of] the bodily form
aggregate of clinging are discontinued, do not arise, do not emerge

- [then] this is reckoned sublime, this is reckoned peaceful, this is
reckoned the complete abandoning of all acquisitions, the eradication
of craving, dispassion, cessation, Nirvāṇa.

“What is the feeling aggregate of clinging? That is, there are six
classes of feeling. What are the six? That is, there is feeling arisen
from eye-contact ... ear-[contact] ... nose-[contact] ... tongue-[contact]
... body-[contact] ... feeling arisen from mind-contact. This is called
the feeling aggregate of clinging. Again, that feeling aggregate of

6 [[SA61]] at T II 15c19 reads: 離欲, corresponding to _virāga_, which in the present context
I take to have the sense of "fading away" rather than "dispassion"; on these two
senses of the Pāli term _virāga_ cf. Anālayo 2009: 36–39.

clinging is impermanent, _dukkha_, and of a nature to change ... _up to_ ...
cessation, Nirvāṇa.

“What is the perception aggregate of clinging? That is, there are six
classes of perception. What are the six? That is, there is perception
arisen from eye-contact ... _up to_ ... perception arisen from mindcontact. This is called the perception aggregate of clinging. Again,
that perception aggregate of clinging is impermanent, _dukkha_, and of
a nature to change ... _up to_ ... cessation, Nirvāṇa.

“What is the formations aggregate of clinging? That is, there are six
classes of intentions. [7 ] What are the six? That is, there is intention
arisen from eye-contact ... _up to_ ... intention arisen from mind-contact.

[16a] This is called the formations aggregate of clinging. Again, that
formations aggregate of clinging is impermanent, _dukkha_, and of a
nature to change ... _up to_ ... cessation, Nirvāṇa.

“What is the consciousness aggregate of clinging? That is, there are
six classes of consciousness. What are the six? That is, there is the
class of eye-consciousness ... _up to_ ... the class of mind-consciousness.
This is called the consciousness aggregate of clinging. Again, that
consciousness aggregate of clinging is impermanent, _dukkha_, and of a
nature to change ... _up to_ ... cessation, Nirvāṇa.

“Monks, if one gives attention with wisdom to this teaching,
examines it, analyses it, and accepts it, [then] one is called a faithfollower, who transcends and leaves behind [the round of] births, [8 ]

who goes beyond the stage of a worldling, who will certainly attain
the fruit of stream-entry and will not pass away in-between without
having attained the fruit of stream-entry.

_cetanā-kāyā [[ITI8]] [[SA61]] at T II 16a6: 超昇離生. A counterpart phrase found in a description of a
_saddhānusārin_ in the otherwise unrelated [[SN25.10]] at SN III 227,29 reads _okkanto_
_sammattaniyāmaṃ_ . I doubt that the phrase in [[SA61]] translates a similarly worded
Indic original, hence I my conjectural rendering as "transcends and leaves behind [the
round of] births".

“Monks, if one gives attention with superior wisdom to this teaching,
examines it, [analyses it], and accepts it, [then] one is called a
Dharma-follower, who transcends and leaves behind [the round of]
births, who goes beyond the stage of a worldling, who will certainly
attain the fruit of stream-entry and will not pass away in-between
without having attained the fruit of stream-entry.

“Monks, one who sees this teaching as it really is with right wisdom
will eradicate the three fetters, abandoning them with knowledge, that
is, [the three fetters of] personality view, clinging to rules, and doubt.
Monks, this is called the fruit of stream-entry; without falling into
evil destinies one will certainly progress rightly to full awakening,
after [at most] seven existences of being reborn as a _deva_ or a human,
one will then [reach] the complete ending of _dukkha_ .

“Monks, if one sees this teaching as it really is with right wisdom and
does not give rise to the influxes in the mind, one is called an arahant,
who has eradicated the influxes, has done what had to be done,
relinquished the heavy burden, gained his own benefit, eradicated all
the fetters of existence, one whose mind with right understanding has
attained liberation.”

When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, the monks, hearing
what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.

# 62. [Discourse on Lustful Attachment]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.

At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “There are five
aggregates of clinging, that is, the bodily form aggregate of clinging
... the feeling ... the perception ... the formations ... the consciousness
aggregate of clinging.

“A foolish unlearned worldling, who is ignorant and without wisdom,
in regard to the five aggregates of clinging gives rise to the view of
self, which is a tie of attachment and a mental tendency to bondage

that gives rise to lustful desires. [9]

“Monks, a learned noble disciple, who has knowledge and wisdom,
in regard to these five aggregates of clinging does not have the view
of self, which is a tie of attachment and a mental tendency to bondage
that gives rise to lustful desires.

“How does a foolish unlearned worldling, who is ignorant and without
wisdom, in regard to the five aggregates of clinging have the view of
self, which is a tie of attachment and a mental tendency to bondage
that gives rise to lustful desires?

“Monks, a foolish unlearned worldling, who is ignorant and without
wisdom, sees bodily form as the self, as distinct from the self [in the
sense of being owned by it], as existing [within the self, or a self] as
existing [within bodily form]. In the same way [he sees] feeling ...
perception ... formations ... consciousness as the self, as distinct from
the self [in the sense of being owned by it], as existing [within the
self, or a self] as existing [within consciousness]. In this way a foolish
unlearned worldling, who is ignorant and without wisdom, in regard
to the five aggregates of clinging proclaims a self, which is a tie of
attachment and a mental tendency to bondage that gives rise to lustful
desires. [16b]

“Monks, how does a [learned] noble disciple, who has knowledge and
wisdom, not proclaim a self, which is a tie of attachment and a mental
tendency to bondage that gives rise to lustful desires? A [learned]
noble disciple does not see bodily form as the self, as distinct from the

way a learned noble disciple, who has knowledge and wisdom, in
regard to the five aggregates of clinging does not have the view of a
self, which is a tie of attachment and a mental tendency to bondage
that gives rise to lustful desires.

“Whatever bodily form, whether past, future or present, internal
or external, gross or subtle, sublime or repugnant, far or near, all
such [bodily form] he rightly contemplates as all being entirely
impermanent. In the same way [whatever] feeling ... perception ...
formations ... consciousness, whether past, future or present, internal
or external, gross or subtle, sublime or repugnant, far or near, all
such [consciousness] he rightly contemplates as all being entirely

“Recluses and Brahmins see bodily form as the self, as distinct from
the self [in the sense of being owned by it], as existing [within the
self, or a self] as existing [within bodily form]. In the same way they
see feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness as the self, as
distinct from the self [in the sense of being owned by it], as existing

[within the self, or a self] as existing [within consciousness].

“In this way a foolish unlearned worldling speculates about the self,
being ignorant of [how] to distinguish it. Contemplating it like this,
he is not separated from ‘mine’. One who is not separated from ‘mine’
engages with the sense faculties. [12] Being engaged with the sense
faculties gives rise to contact. [Through] the six contacts engaging
with contact, pleasure and pain arise to a foolish unlearned worldling,
from which this kind [of view] or others arise, that is, [through] the
six classes of contact. What are the six?

“That is, there is the eye-contact sphere, the ear[-contact] ... nose[contact] ... tongue[-contact] ... body[-contact] ... mind[-contact] sphere.
Monks, there is the mind element, the mind-object element and the
element of ignorance. Being contacted by ignorant contact, a foolish
unlearned worldling proclaims existence, proclaims non-existence,
proclaims existence-and-non-existence, proclaims neither-existencenor-non-existence, proclaims himself to be superior, [proclaims
himself to be inferior], [13] proclaims himself to be equal, [saying:] ‘I

faculties, after which it continues by listing the mind, mind-objects and the element
of ignorance.

“Again, monks, a learned noble disciple, [while] being established
in the six spheres of contact, [15] is able to become disenchanted with
ignorance and is able to give rise to knowledge. With the fading away
of ignorance and the arising of knowledge he does not [proclaim]
existence, does not [proclaim] non-existence, does not [proclaim]
existence-and-non-existence, does not [proclaim] neither-existencenor-non-existence, does not [proclaim] himself to be superior, does
not [proclaim] himself to be inferior, [16c] does not [proclaim] himself
to be equal, [saying:] ‘I know it, I see it.’ Having produced knowledge
like this, vision like this, the formerly arisen contact by ignorance
ceases, whereon contact by knowledge arises.” [16]

When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, the monks, hearing
what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.

# 64. [Discourse on an Inspired Utterance] [17]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
the Eastern Park, the Hall of Migāra’s Mother.

At that time the Blessed One rose from meditation in the afternoon,
came out of the hall and in the shade of the hall sat down on a
prepared seat in front of a great assembly. [18] At that time the Blessed
One uttered an inspired utterance:


14 In [[SN22.47]] at SN III 46,26 the worldling has the notions 'I am', 'I am like this', 'I shall
be', 'I shall not be', 'I shall be of form', 'I shall be formless', 'I shall be percipient', 'I
shall be non-percipient', 'I shall be neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient'.

15 [[SN22.47]] at SN III 47,1 speaks of the five faculties instead.

16 A statement of this type is not found in [[SN22.47]] which also does not have the
standard conclusion reporting the delight of the listening monks.

17 Parallel: [[SN22.55]] at SN III 55,28. A section of [[SA64]] has already been translated
into French by Lamotte 1980: 2291 note 1.

18 [[SN22.55]] does not have such a preamble.

_Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 59 to 87 13


“In the Dharma there is no ‘I’
and also no ‘mine’.
Since there won’t be an ‘I’,
how could ‘mine’ arise?
A monk resolved on this, [19]

will abandon the lower type of fetters.” [20]

Then a certain monk rose up from his seat, bared his right shoulder,
knelt on the ground with his right knee and with palms together said
to the Buddha: “Blessed One, how is it that:

‘ “There is no ‘I’
and also no ‘mine’.
Since there won’t be an ‘I’,
how could ‘mine’ arise?
A monk resolved on this
will abandon the lower type of fetters’?”

The Buddha said to the monk: “A foolish unlearned worldling
speculates that bodily form is the self, is distinct from the self [in
the sense of being owned by it], exists [within the self, or a self]
exists [within bodily form] ... that feeling ... perception ... formations
... consciousness is the self, is distinct from the self [in the sense of
being owned by it], exists [within the self, or a self] exists [within
consciousness]. [21]

“A learned noble disciple does not see bodily form as the self, as
distinct from the self [in the sense of being owned by it], as existing

[within the self, or a self] as existing [within bodily form]. He does
not see feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness as the

cf. Hirakawa 1997: 1068.

20 The corresponding inspired utterance ( _udāna_ ) in [[SN22.55]] at SN III 55,29 reads: "it
might no be, it might not be for me; it shall not be, it shall not be for me."

21 [[SN22.55]] at SN III 56,13 continues by describing that the unlearned worldling does
not understand that the aggregates are impermanent, _dukkha_, not self, conditioned,
and that they will be annihilated.

self, as distinct from the self [in the sense of being owned by it], as
existing [within the self, or a self] as existing [within consciousness];
he is not one who understands [it in this way], not one who sees [it in
this way].

“This bodily form is impermanent; feeling ... perception ... formations
... consciousness is impermanent. Bodily form is _dukkha_ ; feeling ...
perception ... formations ... consciousness is _dukkha_ . Bodily form is
not self; feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness is not
self. This bodily form will not be; feeling ... perception ... formations ...
consciousness will not be. [22] This bodily form will become extinct; [23]
feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness will become
extinct. Therefore it is not I and not mine. There shall be no I and
mine. One who resolves in this way will abandon the five lower types
of fetters.”

Then that monk said to the Buddha: “Blessed One, having abandoned
the five lower types of fetters, how does one eradicate the influxes


22 [[SN22.55]] at SN III 56,31 similarly speaks of the annihilation of each aggregate,
_vibhavissati_, explained by Spk II 275,19 to stand for _bhijjissati_, "will break up".
Bodhi 2000: 1063 note 76 quotes the commentarial gloss and then suggests an
alternative interpretation, according to which "the verb refers to the final cessation
of the aggregates with the attainment of the _anupādisesanibbānadhātu_ . This
meaning harmonizes better with the opening formula, and also seems supported by
Th 715cd: _saṅkhārā vibhavissanti, tattha kā paridevanā_, 'formations (only) will
be exterminated, so what lamentation can there be over that'." Since in [[SA64]] the
_udāna_ does not have a reference that could be taken to imply the final Nirvāṇa of
an arahant, the expression "shall not be", T II 16c20: 非當有, would imply a type
of disappearance along the lines of the commentarial explanation. Regarding the
description of the unlearned worldling in [[SN22.55]] the other characteristics of the
aggregates – being impermanent, _dukkha_, not self, conditioned – all apply to the
worldling's own case. In contrast, the fact that the aggregates of an arahant cease
would be different, since a worldling is not an arahant nor on the path to arahantship. Thus perhaps in [[SN22.55]] _vibhavissati_ also carries a sense that applies to
the worldling, similar to the corresponding expression in [[SA64]] Regarding Th
715, the reading of the stanza is somewhat uncertain, as B [e] and C [e] read _saṅkhārā_
_vigamissanti_ instead, although Norman 1969: 226 argues that "the structure of the
verse, with _bhavati_ appearing four times in one form or another in the first line,
seems to demand a compound of _bhavati_ in the second line."

23 This expression has no counterpart in [[SN22.55]]

knows here and now for oneself and is completely established in the
realization that: ‘Birth for me has been eradicated, the holy life has
been established, what had to be done has been done, I myself know
that there will be no receiving of further existence’?” [24]

The Buddha said to the monk: “A foolish worldling, an unlearned
being, gives rise to dread and fear on occasions that are not fearful.
For a foolish worldling, an unlearned being, it gives rise to fear that:
‘there is no ‘I’,’ that ‘there is no ‘mine’,’ that these two together should
not arise. [25] [17a]

“There are four establishments of consciousness, by which it is
supported. What are the four? That is, consciousness is established
on bodily form, is supported by bodily form, craves for and delights
in bodily form, [thereby] increasing, expanding, and evolving.
Consciousness is established on feeling ... perception ... formations,
is supported by them, craves for and delights in them, [thereby]
increasing, expanding, and evolving.

“Monk, on this occasion consciousness – as it comes, as it goes, as
it is established, as it arises, as it ceases – increases, expands, and
evolves. [26] Suppose someone were to say: ‘There is still another way
how consciousness – as it comes, as it goes, as it is established, as
it arises, as it ceases – increases, expands, and evolves.’ Yet, on
being questioned, one who says so would not know and give rise to
ever more bewilderment, [27] because this is outside the sphere of his


24 The corresponding query in [[SN22.55]] at SN III 57,25 is shorter; the monk just asks
how one should know and see so that the influxes are destroyed immediately.

25 In [[SN22.55]] at SN III 57,29 the worldling is afraid of this: 'it might not be, it might
not be for me; it shall not be, it shall not be for me.' [[SN22.55]] does not indicate that
such fear should not arise, instead of which it continues by describing the case of a
noble disciple who is not afraid.

26 This statement has no counterpart in [[SN22.55]] where the description of
consciousness coming and going, etc., occurs only as part of the impossible claim to
point out an additional mode of consciousness.

experience. [28] Why is that?

“Monks, on having become free from lust for the sphere of bodily
form, the fetter that arises in the mind for bodily form is also
abandoned. On having abandoned the fetter that arises in the mind
for bodily form, the support for consciousness is also abandoned.
Consciousness will not be further established and will not further
increase, expand or evolve. On having become free from lust for the
sphere of feeling ... perception ... formations, the fetter that arises in
the mind for feeling ... perception ... formations is also abandoned.
On having abandoned the fetter that arises in the mind for feeling
... perception ... formations, the support [for consciousness] is also
abandoned. Consciousness will not be further established and it will
not further increase, expand or evolve.

“Because consciousness is not established anywhere, it does not
increase. Because of not increasing, it is not active anywhere. Because
of not being active anywhere, it is steady. [29] Because of being steady,
it is content. Because of being content, it is liberated. [30] Because of
being liberated, there is no clinging to anything in the whole world.
Because of not clinging to anything, there is no being attached to
anything. Because of not being attached to anything, one personally
realizes Nirvāṇa, [knowing]: ‘Birth for me has been eradicated, the
holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, I
know myself that there will be no receiving of further existence.’

indication that consciousness is "nowhere established", 無所住. The corresponding
statement in [[SN22.55]] at SN III 58,22 similarly begins with the expression _apatiṭṭhita_
and at the present juncture has _ṭhita_ . I have followed the example of Bodhi 2000:
894, who translates _apatiṭṭhita_ as "unestablished" and _ṭhita_ as "steady".

where in [[SN22.5]] at SN III 13,29 the Buddha recommends the development of
concentration, whereas in [[SN22.6]] at SN III 15,20 he recommends seclusion. Since

_antas_, which are: the _sakkāyanta_ (on this term cf. the note below), its arising, its
cessation, and the path to its cessation.

is on the side of identity, and the cessation of what is on the side of
identity. Listen and pay careful attention to what I shall tell you. What
is on the side of identity? That is, it is the five aggregates of clinging.
What are the five? They are the bodily form aggregate of clinging ...
the feeling ... the perception ... the formations ... the consciousness
aggregate of clinging. This is called what is on the side of identity.

“What is the arising of what is on the side of identity? That is, it is
craving for experiencing future becoming, which is conjoined with
lust and joy, delighting with attachment here and there – this is called
the arising of what is on the side of identity. [51]

“What is the cessation of what is on the side of identity? That is, it
is the abandoning without remainder of this craving to experience
future becoming, which is conjoined with lust and joy, delighting with
attachment here and there, its vomiting out, its eradication, its fading
away, its cessation, its appeasement, its disappearance – this is called
the cessation of what is on the side of identity.

50 [[SA70]] at T II 18b17: 有身邊, counterpart to the term _sakkāyanta_ . Translations of
_sakkāyanta_ vary; Bodhi 2000: 963 uses "portion of identity", Woodward 1925/1975:
134: "person pack", and Ñānaponika 1967/2003: 173 "Endpunkt der Persönlichkeit".
I have not followed any of these renderings for the following reasons: While "person
pack" strikes me as somewhat unclear, the sense of "portion" or a "final point" does
not seem to me to work so well, since _sakkāyanta_ stands in both discourses for all
five aggregates of clinging and thus for the whole of identity, not a portion of it
and also not its final point. Choong 2000: 39 renders the Chinese equivalent as "the
totality of personality", which fits the fact well that the expression stands for all of
the five aggregates of clinging. I have nevertheless opted for "what is on the side of
identity", since the "side" is one of the main meanings of _anta_, cf., e.g., the phrase
_ekamantaṃ_ in the standard description of someone who sits or stands "at one side".

existence, and for annihilation; on this recurring difference between Pāli discourses
and their _Saṃyukta-āgama_ parallels cf. Choong 2000: 166, Delhey 2009: 69 note 4
and Anālayo 2011: 70 note 216.

of what is on the side of identity’.” [52]

When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, the monks, hearing
what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.

_As fo_ r “I will teach”, _[so with]_ “there is” _and_ “you should understand”

_[three discourses] are to be recited in the same way_ . [53]

# 71. [Discourse on Identity] [54]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.

At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “I will now teach you
identity, [18c] the arising of identity, the cessation of identity, and the
path to the cessation of identity. Listen and pay careful attention to
what I shall tell you.

“What is identity? That is, it is the five aggregates of clinging. [55]
What are the five? They are the bodily form aggregate of clinging ...
the feeling ... the perception ... the formations ... the consciousness
aggregate of clinging. This is called identity.

“What is the arising of identity? It is craving for future becoming,
which is conjoined with lust and joy, delighting with attachment here
and there – this is called the arising of identity. [56]


52 Instead of a repetition of the introductory statement, [[SN22.103]] at SN III 158,15
expounds the noble eightfold path as what leads to the cessation of _sakkāyanta_ .

53 The count of three discourses is mentioned in the _uddāna_ .

54 Parallel: [[SN22.105]] at SN III 159, 5 and a discourse quotation in the
_Abhidharmakośabhāṣya_, Pradhan 1967: 281,20, with a fuller quotation preserved in
Śamathadeva's _Abhidharmakośopāyikāṭīkā_, [[DN4094]] _ju_ 268b1 or Q 5595 _thu_ 11b4,
translated below by Dhammadinnā 2013: 130f. A section of [[SA71]] has already been
translated by Choong 2000: 39f.

55 Pradhan 1967: 281,20: _satkāyaḥ pañcopādānaskandhāḥ_ .

56 My translation follows the suggestion by Yìnshùn 1983: 115 note 5 to emend 染 to 樂,
in line with the formulation used in the exposition on cessation.


On the Five Aggregates (3) ─ A Translation of
_Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 59 to 87 29


“What is the cessation of identity? It is the abandoning without
remainder of this craving for future becoming, which is conjoined
with lust and joy, delighting with attachment here and there, its
vomiting out, its eradication, its fading away, its cessation – this is
called the cessation of identity.

“What is path to the cessation of identity? That is, it is the noble
eightfold path: right view, right intention, right speech, right
action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right
concentration. This is called the path to the cessation of identity.

“This is called [the explanation of:] ‘I will teach you identity, the
arising of identity, the cessation of identity, and the path to the
cessation of identity’.” [57]

When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, the monks, hearing
what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.

_Another [discourse] is to be recited in the same way, with the_
_difference_ : “you should understand identity, you should understand
the abandoning of the arising of identity, you should understand the
realization of the cessation of identity, and you should understand the
cultivation of the path to the abandoning of identity.”

When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, the monks, hearing
what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.

_As for_ “I will teach”, _[so with]_ “there is” _and_ “you should understand”,

_[three discourses] should be recited in the same way, again with the_
_difference_ : “a monk who understands identity, abandons the arising
of identity, realizes the cessation of identity, and cultivates the path to
the abandoning of identity is called a monk who has abandoned the
bondage of desire and craving, and all that is of the nature to fetter,
who has cultivated comprehension and completely made an end of
_dukkha_ .”

_Again [it should be recited] with this difference_ : “This is called [[AN57]] Such a statement is not found in [[SN22.105]]


30 法鼓佛學學報第13期（民國102年）


monk who [has reached] the complete end, the supreme freedom from

[mental] dust, the supreme holy life, a pure true person [ _sappurisa_ ].”

_Again [it should be recited] with this difference_ : “This is called
a monk who is an arahant, who has eradicated the influxes, who
has done what had to be done, who has relinquished the heavy
burden, who has gained his own benefit, who has eradicated all the
fetters of existence, and whose mind has been liberated with right
comprehension.”

_Again [it should be recited] with this difference_ : “This is called
a monk who has abandoned the barrier, crossed over the moat,
surpassed the limitations, shed off all guards, and established the
noble banner of the Dharma.”

_Again [it should be recited] with this difference_ : “What is abandoning
the barrier? That is, it is abandoning the five lower types of fetter.
What is crossing over the moat? That is, it is crossing over the deep
moat of ignorance. What is surpassing the limitations? That is, it is
the supreme [surpassing] of the beginningless [round of] births and
deaths. What is shedding of all guards? That is, it is eradicating the
craving for becoming. What is establishing the noble banner of the
Dharma? That is, it is eradicating the ‘I’-conceit.”

_Again [it should be recited] with this difference_ : “This is called a
monk who has abandoned five factors, [58] who has accomplished six
factors, who is protected by one, who has supports of four types,
who has relinquished all [individual worldly] truths, who is free from


58 My translation of the first ten epithets is based on a similar listing found in [[AN10.20]]
at AN V 30,5, according to which the five factors ( _aṅga_ ) are the five hindrances; the
six factors refer to equanimity at the six sense-doors; the single guard is mindfulness;
the four supports are using, enduring, avoiding and dispelling with reflection; the
individual truths ( _paccekasacca_ ) are the standard wrong views (the world is eternal,
etc.); the quests ( _esaṇā_ ) are for sensuality, existence, and the holy life; the intentions
to be purified are the standard three; the bodily actions are calmed with the fourth
absorption; the mind is well liberated from the three poisons; and the mind well
liberated by wisdom refers to understanding that the mind has been well liberated
from the three poisons.


On the Five Aggregates (3) ─ A Translation of
_Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 59 to 87 31


any quest, who has purified all realizations, [59] whose bodily actions
are calm, whose mind is well liberated, [19a] who is well liberated
by wisdom, who is singly established in the holy life, being an
unsurpassable person.”

# 72. [Discourse on Understanding Things] [60]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.

At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “I will teach you
things to be understood, knowledge, and one who knows. Listen and
pay careful attention to what I shall tell you.

“What are the things to be understood? That is, they are the five
aggregates of clinging. What are the five? They are the bodily form
aggregate of clinging ... the feeling ... the perception ... the formations
... the consciousness aggregate of clinging. These are called things to
be understood.

“What is knowledge? The disciplining of lustful desire, the
abandoning of lustful desire, the going beyond lustful desire – this is
called knowledge. [61]

“Who is the one who knows? It is the arahant. [62] The arahant neither
exists in another world after death, nor does he not exist in another


59 [[SA71]] at T II 18c29 here uses 覺, whereas the corresponding quality in [[AN10.20]] at
AN V 30,7 speaks of "intentions", _saṅkappa_ .

60 Parallel: [[SN22.106]] at SN III 159,23. Akanuma 1929/1990: 30 mentions also [[SN22.23]] at SN III 26,18, but this discourse only takes up things that should be fully
understood and full understanding, it thus has no counterpart to the exposition on the
arahant as the one who has fully understood. Hence [[SN22.106]] is the closer parallel
to [[SA72]] For discourses 72 to 81 my reconstruction of the respective titles is based
on the _uddāna_ found after discourse 81.

61 [[SN22.106]] at SN III 160,1 instead defines full understanding as the destruction of
lust, hatred, and delusion.

62 [[SN22.106]] at SN III 160,4 continues by indicating that such an arahant would be a
venerable one of such and such a name and clan; it thus does not have a counterpart
to the ensuing description in [[SA72]]

world after death, nor does he exist-and-not-exist in another world
after death, nor does he neither-exist-nor-not-exist in another world
after death. Stating this in detail is without limit, [as for him] all
reckonings have forever ceased.

“This is called the teaching of things to be understood, knowledge,
and one who knows.”

When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, the monks, hearing
what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.

# 73. [Discourse on the Heavy Burden] [63]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.

At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “I will now teach you
the heavy burden, the taking up of the burden, the relinquishing of the
burden, and the one who [carries] the burden. [64] Listen and pay careful
attention to what I shall tell you. [65]


63 Parallel: [[SN22.22]] at SN III 25,14, [[EA25.4]] at T II 631c11, SHT IV 30b, Sander and
Waldschmidt 1980: 79, and discourse quotations in the _Abhidharmakośabhāṣya_,
Pradhan 1967: 468,2, in the _Abhidharmakośavyākhyā_, Wogihara 1971: 706,3,
identified as a quotes from the present discourse in Pāsādika 1989: 128
(§518); in the _Tattvasaṅgraha_, Shastri 1981: 165,1; and in Śamathadeva's
_Abhidharmakośopāyikāṭīkā_, [[DN4094]] _nyu_ 85b4 or Q 5595 _thu_ 132a7, translated
below by Dhammadinnā 2013: 132ff. [[SA73]] has been translated into German by
Frauwallner 1956: 25f.

64 Pradhan 1967: 468,2: _bhāraṃ ca vo bhikṣavo deśayiṣyāmi bhārādānaṃ ca_
_bhāranikṣepaṇaṃ ca bhārahāraṃ ceti_ (= Wogihara 1971: 706,3 which continues
the quotation and therefore ends with _ca_ ), Shastri 1981: 165,1: _bhāraṃ vo bhikṣavo_
_deśayiṣyāmi bhārādānaṃ bhāranikṣepaṃ bhārahāraṃ ca_ . The counterpart to
_bhārāhāra_ in [[SA73]] at T II 19a17 reads just: 擔者. [[SN22.22]] at SN III 25,15 and [[EA25.4]] at T II 631c12 adopt a different sequence of listing here and in their exposition,
as after the burden comes the one who carries it, which is then followed by the
taking up (or its causal condition, 因緣, in [[EA25.4]]) and the laying down or giving
up of the burden. In a recapitulation of the initial statement, [[EA25.4]] at T II 631c25
then adopts yet another sequence: the burden, its causal condition, the carrier, and its
giving up.

“What is the heavy burden? That is, it is the five aggregates of
clinging. What are the five? They are the bodily form aggregate
of clinging ... the feeling ... the perception ... the formations ... the
consciousness aggregate of clinging. [66]

“What is the taking up of the burden? It is craving for future
becoming, which is conjoined with lust and joy, delighting with
attachment here and there. [67]

“What is the relinquishing of the burden? It is if the craving for
future becoming, which is conjoined with lust and joy, delighting
with attachment here and there, has been forever abandoned without
remainder, has ceased, been vomited out, been eradicated, faded
away, ceased, and disappeared. [68]

“Who is the one who [carries] the burden? That is, he is the person;
a person who has such a name, such a birth, such a clan, such food,
such experience of pleasure and pain, such life span, such length of
existence, such limit of the life span. [69]

definition in [[SN22.22]] at SN III 25,22 is shorter; it just mentions that the person is a
venerable one, _āyasmant_, of such name and such clan. [[EA25.4]] at T II 631c19 is more
detailed, similar to [[SA73]]

“This is called the heavy burden, the taking up of the burden, the
relinquishing of the burden, and the one who [carries] the burden.” [70]

At that time the Blessed One spoke these stanzas:

“Having relinquished the heavy burden, [71]

one should not take it up again.
The heavy load is great _dukkha_,
relinquishing the load is a great delight.

“One should abandon all craving
and eradicate all formations. [72]

Fully understanding existence and the remainder of the mental sphere
one will no more revolve in further existence.” [73 ] [19b]

When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, the monks, hearing
what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.


70 SHT IV 30b V3, Sander and Waldschmidt 1980: 79: _bhāraharaṃ c-eti iti me ya_ .
[[EA25.4]] at T II 631c27 instead continues with an injunction to the monks that they
should approach a tree, etc., and meditate without negligence.

71 A counterpart to the first two lines can be found at the beginning of the second stanza
in [[SN22.22]] at SN III 26,14, with the difference that the not taking up of another
burden is a completed action, instead of being an injunction. The first stanza in [[SN22.22]] at SN III 26,10 begins instead by identifying the five aggregates as the burden
and the person as the one who carries the burden. Similar to [[SA73]] the stanza in [[EA25.4]] at T II 631c29 begins with the theme of relinquishing the burden without taking
up a new one.

72 SHT IV 30b V4, Sander and Waldschmidt 1980: 79: _(sa)ṃskārasaṃkṣayāt_
_sarvvopatipa_ (the editors note 4 suggest reading _sarvvopadhi_ °). Instead of referring
to formations in general, 行, [[EA25.4]] at T II 632a2 recommends relinquishing
activities that are against the Dharma, 捨非法行.

73 [[SN22.22]] at SN III 26,16 indicates that one who has pulled out craving with its root
is stilled ( _nicchāta_ ) and fully quenched ( _parinibbuta_ ). According to [[EA25.4]] at T II
632a3, one should completely relinquish this (i.e. what was mentioned in the stanza
before), so that one will not experience further becoming (adopting the variant 有
instead of 愛).

within, without understanding its origin, without understanding its
crossing over, [77] without understanding the escape from it. [78]

world in bondage. [[SN22.117]] does not continue by bringing in Māra. As already

“Monks what is the difference between the Tathāgata, who is an
arahant, fully awakened, and an arahant who has been liberated by
wisdom? ” [89]

The monks said to the Buddha: “The Tathāgata is the root of the
Dharma, the eye of the Dharma, [19c] the foundation of the Dharma. [90]
May the Blessed One explain the meaning of this fully to the monks.
Having heard it, the monks will uphold and receive it respectfully.”

The Buddha said to the monks: “Listen and pay careful attention
to what I shall tell you. The Tathāgata, who is an arahant, [91] fully
awakened, has realized the Dharma that he had not heard before, has
been able himself to realize the Dharma, to penetrate to supreme
awakening. He teaches the Dharma to future generations to awaken

four right efforts, the four bases for supernatural power, the five
faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening [factors], and the

_smṛtyu[pa]_ .

93 The explanation of the difference in [[SN22.58]] at SN III 66,15 is that the Tathāgata has
given rise to, brought into being, and proclaimed the path; he is the one who knows
the path, has discovered it, and is skilled in it. The disciples now dwell following
the path, having become endowed with it afterwards. Both versions do not offer a
comparable description of the arahant, which appears to be implicit in the description
given of the Tathāgata, in the sense that only the Tathāgata discovers the path.


On the Five Aggregates (3) ─ A Translation of
_Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 59 to 87 39


“Monks, this is called a Tathāgata, who is an arahant, fully awakened,
who has attained what had not been attained, [94] who has gained what
had not been gained, who understands the path, who distinguishes the
path, who teaches the path, who penetrates the path, who moreover
is able to successfully teach and admonish disciples, who in this way
teaches them rightly and in such a way that they joyfully delight in
the good Dharma. This is called the difference between a Tathāgata
and an arahant.”

When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, the monks, hearing
what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.

# 76. [Discourse on Contemplation] [95]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.

At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “There are five
aggregates of clinging. What are the five? They are the bodily form
aggregate of clinging ... the feeling ... the perception ... the formations
... the consciousness aggregate of clinging. [96] Monks, you should
examine bodily form. Having examined bodily form, do you see it as
being the self, as distinct from the self [in the sense of being owned
by it], as existing [within the self, or a self] as existing [within bodily
form]? ”

The monks said to the Buddha: “No, Blessed One.”


94 SHT IV 30b R10, Sander and Waldschmidt 1980: 80: _[sa]ṃmyaksaṃbuddho_
_anadhigata[s](ya)_ .

95 Parallel: [[SN22.118]] at SN III 165,26. Akanuma 1929/1990: 30 also mentions the
closely similar [[SN22.119]] at SN III 166,9. The difference between the two Pāli
discourses is that in [[SN22.118]] the monks indicate that they do not regard bodily
form, etc., as a self, while in [[SN22.119]] they affirm that they do regard bodily form,
etc., as not being a self. Thus [[SN22.118]] is a closer parallel to [[SA76]]

96 [[SN22.118]] does not have an introductory exposition on the five aggregates of
clinging.

The Buddha said to the monks: “It is well, it is well. Bodily form is
not self. What is not self is impermanent. What is impermanent is
_dukkha_ . [97] If it is _dukkha_, then it is entirely without a self, it is not
distinct from the self [in the sense of being owned by it], and it does
not exist [within the self, nor does a self] exist [within it]. This is
how it should be contemplated. Feeling ... perception ... formations ...
consciousness _are also like this_ .

“A learned noble disciple examines these five aggregates of clinging
as being without a self and without what belongs to a self. Having
examined them in this way, he does not cling to anything in the world.
One who does not cling to anything is not attached to anything.
One who is not attached to anything personally realizes Nirvāṇa,

[knowing]: ‘Birth for me has been eradicated, the holy life has been
established, what had to be done has been done, I myself know that
there will be no receiving of further existence.’”

it, bodily form will be abandoned. Having abandoned bodily form,

arises, is established, and emerges, then _dukkha_ arises therewith,
disease is established therewith, and old age and death emerge
therewith. Feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness _should_

_dukkha_ ceases therewith, disease is appeased therewith, and old age

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in

At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “Past and future
bodily form is after all impermanent, what to say of present bodily
form! [102] A learned noble disciple who examines it in this way is not
concerned with past bodily form and does not rejoice in future bodily

two discourse apply the otherwise same exposition to the aggregates being _dukkha_

parallel appears to be [[SN22.9]] which also takes up the theme of impermanence.
The indications given at the end of [[SA79]] to recite the same exposition by replacing
impermanence with _dukkha_ and with not self would then correspond to [[SN22.10]]

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in

At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “I will teach you
the seal of the noble Dharma and the reaching of purification of

[knowledge and] vision. Listen and pay careful attention.

“If a monk speaks like this: ‘Without having attained concentration
on emptiness, I shall give rise to signlessness ( _animitta_ ), nothingness,
and have knowledge and vision of being free from conceit’, he
should not speak like this. Why is that? Without having attained

[concentration on] emptiness, it is impossible to claim: [20b] ‘I attain
signlessness, nothingness, and have knowledge and vision of being
free from conceit’.

“If a monk speaks like this: ‘I attain [concentration on] emptiness
and I am able to give rise to signlessness, nothingness, and have
knowledge and vision of being free from conceit,’ then this is well
spoken. Why is that? It is certainly possible that, having attained

[concentration on] emptiness, one is able to give rise to signlessness,
nothingness, and have knowledge and vision of being free from
conceit.

On the Five Aggregates (3) ─ A Translation of
_Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 59 to 87 45


The monks said to the Buddha: “The Buddha is the root of the
Dharma, the eye of Dharma, the foundation of the Dharma. May he
teach us! Having heard him teach the Dharma, the monks will receive
it respectfully as he has taught it.”

The Buddha said to the monks: “Suppose a monk sits down in an
empty place at the root of a tree and well contemplates bodily form as
being impermanent, being of a nature to wear away and to fade away.
In the same way he examines feeling ... perception ... formations ...
consciousness as being impermanent, being of a nature to wear away
and to fade away. Examining those aggregates as being impermanent,
of a nature to wear away, to be unstable, and to change, his mind is
delighted, purified, and liberated. This is called emptiness. One who
contemplates in this way, even though not yet able to be free from
conceit, purifies his knowledge and vision.

“Again there is a rightly attending to concentration by contemplating
the abandoning of the sign ( _nimitta_ ) of forms, the abandoning of the
sign of sounds, of odours, of flavours, of tangibles, and of mental
objects. [113] This is called signlessness. [114] One who contemplates in this
way, even though not yet free from conceit, purifies his knowledge
and vision.

“Again there is a rightly attending to concentration by contemplating
the abandoning of the sign of lust, the abandoning of the sign of
anger ... and of delusion. [115] This is called nothingness. One who
contemplates in this way, even though not yet free from conceit,
purifies his knowledge and vision.

“Again there is a rightly attending to concentration by contemplating:
‘From where do [the notions] ‘I’ and ‘mine’ arise?’ [116]

‘[The notions] ‘I’ and ‘mine’ arise from seeing, from hearing, from
smelling, from tasting, from touching, and from cognizing.’ [117]

“Again he examines like this: ‘Whatever causes and conditions
give rise to consciousness, [118] are those causes and conditions for
consciousness permanent or impermanent?’ [119]

“Again he reflects like this: ‘Whatever causes and conditions give rise
to consciousness, [120] all those causes and conditions for consciousness
are entirely impermanent’. Again, those causes and conditions all
being entirely impermanent, how could consciousness, which arises
from them, be permanent?’

“That which is impermanent is a conditioned formation, it has
arisen from conditions and it is of a perilous nature, of a nature to
cease, of a nature to fade away, of a nature to be abandoned with
understanding. [121] This is called the seal of the noble Dharma and the
purification of knowledge and vision.

“This is called [the explanation of:] ‘Monks, I will teach you the seal
of the noble Dharma and the purification of knowledge and vision’, as
taught fully in this way.” [122]

# 81. [Discourse on Pūraṇa] [123]

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Vesalī in
the Hall with the Peaked Roof by the side of the Monkey Pond. [124]

At that time there was a Licchavi by the name of Mahānāma, who
every day used to roam around. [20c] While he was approaching the
Buddha, [125] that Licchavi thought: ‘If I were to approach the Blessed
One in the morning, then the Blessed One and the monks known
to me will all be meditating. Let me now approach the _ājīvika_ s and
heterodox practitioners who are at the Seven Mango Trees.’ He
approached the place where Pūraṇa Kassapa stayed.

Then Pūraṇa Kassapa, being the leader of an assembly of heterodox
practitioners, was surrounded on all sides by five hundred heterodox
practitioners, who were making a loud clamour discussing worldly
things. Then Pūraṇa Kassapa, on seeing from afar that the Licchavi
Mahānāma was coming, told his followers that they should stay quiet:
“You be silent! This is the Licchavi Mahānāma, who is a disciple of
the recluse Gotama. Among those who are white clothed disciples of
the recluse Gotama in Vesalī he is foremost. They always delight in
quietude and commend quietude. He approaches quiet assemblies,
therefore you should be quiet.”

Then Mahānāma approached the assembly of Pūraṇa and exchanged

223f note 95.

125 The Buddha's visitor in [[SN22.60]] has the name Mahāli; he directly approaches the
Buddha to report the view held by Pūraṇa Kassapa. Thus [[SN22.60]] does not report
an actual encounter with Pūraṇa.

polite greetings with Pūraṇa. Having friendly greeted each other, he
withdrew to sit at one side. Then Mahānāma said to Pūraṇa: “I heard
that Pūraṇa gives this teaching to his disciples: ‘There is no cause,
there is no condition for the defilement of living beings; there is no
cause, there is no condition for the purification of living beings.’ [126]

“In the world, is there such a doctrine? Is this truly yours? Or is this
a saying by an outsider to discredit you? Is this composed by people
in the world, is this your teaching or is this not your teaching? Are
there people in the world who have discussed this with you, closely
questioned you about it, and criticized it?”

Pūraṇa Kassapa said: “It is true that there is such a doctrine [by
me], it is not handed down wrongly in the world. I have established
this doctrine, this doctrine is in accordance with my teaching and
doctrines. I proclaim this teaching, it is all in line with my teaching
and no person in the world has come and, closely questioning me,
criticized it. Why is that? Mahānāma, I have this view and make
this proclamation: ‘There is no cause, there is no condition for the
defilement of living beings; there is no cause, there is no condition for
the purification of living beings.’”

Then Mahānāma, hearing what Pūraṇa had said, was not pleased in
his mind. Having disapproved of it, he rose from his seat and left.
He approached the Blessed One, paid homage with his head at the

[Buddha’s] feet, withdrew to sit at one side and told the Buddha fully
the discussion he had had with Pūraṇa.

The Buddha said to the Licchavi Mahānāma: “What that Pūraṇa has
said, giving vent to his ideas, is not worth being remembered. Pūraṇa
is thus a fool, he does not differentiate and is unskilful. Denying
causation, he says this: ‘There is no cause, there is no condition for


126 While [[SN22.60]] at SN III 69,3 agrees with [[SA81]] that this was the view held by
Pūraṇa Kassapa, [[DN2]] at DN I 53,25 instead associates this view with Makkhali
Gosāla, as does a parallel in the _Saṅghabhedavastu_, Gnoli 1978: 221,28, whereas
[[DA27]] at T I 108c10 associates such a view with Pakudha Kaccāyana; for
comparative studies of the parallel versions of [[DN2]] cf. Bapat 1948, Meisig 1987,
and Macqueen 1988.

the defilement of living beings; there is no cause, there is no condition
for the purification of living beings.’ Why is that? There is a cause,
there is a condition for the defilement of living beings; there is a
cause, there is a condition for the purification of living beings.’ [127]

“Mahānāma, what is the cause, what is the condition for the
defilement of living beings? [21a] What is the cause, what is the
condition for the purification of living beings?

“Mahānāma, if bodily form were entirely _dukkha_ and unpleasant, [128]
not followed by pleasure and not nourishing pleasure, being without
pleasure, [then] living beings would not give rise to delight and
attachment because of it. [129] Mahānāma, because bodily form is not
entirely _dukkha_ and unpleasant, [but] is followed by pleasure and
nourishes pleasure, being not without pleasure, therefore living beings
are defiled by attachment to bodily form. Because of being defiled
by attachment, they are tied to it. Because of being tied to it, there is
vexation. [130]


127 At this point [[SN22.60]] at SN III 69,12 continues with a question by Mahāli about
the causes and conditions.

128 My translation here and below follows the suggestion by Yìnshùn 1983: 133 notes 3
and 4 to delete 非 found at the outset of the phrase.

“Mahānāma, if feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness
were entirely _dukkha_ and unpleasant, [131] not followed by pleasure
and not nourishing pleasure, being without pleasure, [then] living
beings would not give rise to delight and attachment because of
it. [132] Mahānāma, because consciousness is not entirely _dukkha_ and
unpleasant, [but] is followed by pleasure and nourishes pleasure,
being not without pleasure, therefore living beings are defiled by
attachment to consciousness. Because of being defiled by attachment,
they are tied to it. Because of being tied to it, vexation arises. [133]

“Mahānāma, this is called [the explanation of]: ‘there is a cause, there
is a condition for the defilement of living beings.’

“Mahānāma, what is the cause, what is the condition for the
purification of living beings? [134]

“Mahānāma, if bodily form were entirely pleasant and not _dukkha_,
not followed by _dukkha_ and not nourishing sorrow and pain,
being without _dukkha_, [then] living beings would not give rise to
disenchantment because of bodily form. Mahānāma, because bodily
form is not entirely pleasant and is _dukkha_, [135] is followed by _dukkha_
and nourishes sorrow and pain, not being without _dukkha_, therefore
living beings give rise to disenchantment towards bodily form.
Because of being disenchanted, they do not delight in it. Because of
not delighting in it, they are liberated from it.

on the causes and conditions for the purification of living beings.

[then] living beings would not give rise to disenchantment because
of consciousness. Mahānāma, because feeling ... perception ...

“Mahānāma, this is called [the explanation of]: ‘There is a cause,

Then Mahānāma, hearing what the Buddha had said, rejoiced and was
delighted. He paid respect to the Buddha and left.

# 82. [Discourse at the Bamboo Park] [138]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at the
dwelling of the [Eastern] Bamboo Park among the Cetis.

At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “What does a learned
noble disciple regard as impermanent and _dukkha_ ?” [139]

The monks said to the Buddha: “The Blessed One is the root of the
Dharma, the eye of Dharma, the foundation of the Dharma. May he
teach us! Having heard it, the monks will receive it respectfully as he
has taught it.”

The Buddha said to the monks: “Listen and pay careful attention to
what I shall tell you. [140] A learned noble disciple regards bodily form
as impermanent and _dukkha_, [141] [21b] he regards feeling ... perception ...
formations ... consciousness as impermanent and _dukkha_ . Monks, is
bodily form permanent or impermanent?”

The monks said to the Buddha: “It is impermanent, Blessed One.”

[The Buddha said]: “Monks, what is impermanent, is it _dukkha_ ?”

The monks said to the Buddha: “It is _dukkha_, Blessed One.”

[The Buddha said]: “Monks, what is impermanent, _dukkha_, of a
nature to change, would a learned noble disciple herein regard it as
the self, as distinct from the self [in the sense of being owned by it],
as existing [within the self, or the self] as existing [within it]?” [142]

The monks said to the Buddha: “No, Blessed One.”

[The Buddha said]: “Feeling ... perception ... formations ...
consciousness _are also like this_ . Therefore, monks, whatever bodily
form, whether past, future or present, internal or external, gross or
subtle, sublime or repugnant, far or near, [143] all of it is entirely not self,
not distinct from the self [in the sense of being owned by it], does
not exist [within the self, nor does a self] exist [within it]. Feeling ...
perception ... formations ... consciousness _are also like this_ . [144]

“A learned noble disciple who examines it in this way becomes
disenchanted with bodily form, becomes disenchanted with feeling
... perception ... formations ... consciousness. [145] Because of being
disenchanted, he does not delight in it. Because of not delighting in it,

what had to be done has been done, I myself know that there will be
no receiving of further existence.’”

Then the monks, hearing what the Buddha had said, were delighted
and received it respectfully.

# 83. [Discourse at Vesalī] [147]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Vesalī in
the Hall with the Peaked Roof by the side of the Monkey Pond. [148]

At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “What does a learned
noble disciple regard as not self, as not distinct from the self [in the
sense of being owned by it], as not existing [within the self, nor a self]
as existing [within it], so that rightly and evenly contemplating it in
this way he knows and sees it as it really is?”

The monks said to the Buddha: “The Blessed One is the root of the
Dharma, the eye of Dharma, the foundation of the Dharma. May he
teach us! Having heard it, the monks will receive it respectfully as he
has taught it.”

The Buddha said to the monks: “Listen and pay careful attention to

The monks said to the Buddha: “It is impermanent, Blessed One.”

[The Buddha] again said to the monks: “What is impermanent, is it
_dukkha_ ?”

The monks said to the Buddha: “It is _dukkha_, Blessed One.”

[The Buddha said]: “Monks, what is impermanent, _dukkha_, of a
nature to change, would a learned noble disciple herein regard it as
the self, as distinct from the self [in the sense of being owned by it],
as existing [within the self, or the self] as existing [within it]?”

[The Buddha said]: “Feeling ... perception ... formations ...

rightly contemplating it as it really is. [21c] Feeling ... perception ...

“A learned noble disciple who examines it in this way attains
liberation from bodily form, attains liberation from feeling ...
perception ... formations ... consciousness. I say, he is liberated from
birth, old age, disease, death, worry, sorrow, vexation, and pain, from
this entire great mass of _dukkha_ .’”

When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, the monks, hearing
what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.

# 84. [Discourse on Purification] [149]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.


149 Parallel: [[SN22.45]] at SN III 44,33, fragment Kha ii 1d/10c/12a, La Vallée Poussin
1913: 577f, revised edition in Chung 2008: 311–313; cf. Anālayo 2012: 16f; for
discourse quotations cf. also Chung 2008: 59.


On the Five Aggregates (3) ─ A Translation of
_Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 59 to 87 55


At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “Bodily form is
impermanent. What is impermanent is _dukkha_ . What is _dukkha_ is not
I and not the self; it is entirely not the self, not distinct from the self

[in the sense of being owned by it], and does not exist [within the self,
nor does a self] exist [within it]. Understanding this, as it really is, is
called right contemplation. [150]

“Feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness _are also like_
_this_ . A learned noble disciple examines these five aggregates of
clinging as being without a self and without what belongs to a self.
Examining them in this way he does not cling to anything in the
whole world. Because of not clinging to anything, he is not attached
to anything. Because of not being attached to anything, he personally
realizes Nirvāṇa, [knowing]: ‘Birth for me has been eradicated, the
holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, I
myself know that there will be no receiving of further existence.’” [151]

When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, the monks, hearing
what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.


150 According to [[SN22.45]] at SN III 45,3, such seeing with wisdom results in dispassion
and liberation from the influxes through not clinging.

151 [[SN22.45]] at SN III 45,9 proceeds differently, as it indicates that being liberated
the mind is steady, content, and not agitated, which then leads to the realization
of Nirvāṇa. The sequence in [[SN22.45]] is not entirely clear to me, since already
the liberation through not clinging in relation to each aggregate seems to imply
the reaching of the final goal, hence there would be no need to continue from that
by indicating that the steady, content, and not agitated mind realizes Nirvāṇa.
Perhaps this is the result of an error in textual transmission. In fact, in relation to
the last part, which seems somewhat redundant, Bodhi 2000: 1056 note 59 points
out that "it is noteworthy that the passage makes an unexpected transition from
impersonal neuter nominatives (describing the bhikkhu's mind, _cittaṃ_ ) to verbs
that imply a personal subject ( _na paritassati, parinibbāyati, pajānāti_ )." Such an
unexpected transition may well be the sign of a passage having been added, perhaps
inadvertently during oral transmission, which originally did not belong to this
discourse.

# 85. [Discourse on Rightly Examining] [152]

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.

At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “Monks, what does
one not regard as the self, as distinct from the self [in the sense of
being owned by it], as existing [within the self, or the self] as existing

[within it]?”

The monks said to the Buddha: “The Blessed One is the root of the
Dharma, the eye of Dharma, the foundation of the Dharma. May he
teach us! Having heard it, the monks will receive it respectfully as he
has taught it.”

The Buddha said to the monks: “Listen and pay careful attention to
what I shall tell you. One does not regard bodily form as the self, as
distinct from the self [in the sense of being owned by it], as existing

[within the self, or the self] as existing [within it]. One does not

[regard] feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness ... _also_
_like this_ .

“Monks, is bodily form permanent or impermanent?”

The monks said to the Buddha: “It is impermanent, Blessed One.”

The Buddha said: “Monks, what is impermanent, is it _dukkha_ ?”

The monks said to the Buddha: “It is _dukkha_, Blessed One.”

[The Buddha said]: “Monks, what is impermanent, _dukkha_, of a
nature to change, would a learned noble disciple herein regard it as
the self, as distinct from the self [in the sense of being owned by it],
as existing [within the self, or the self] as existing [within it]?”

The monks said to the Buddha: “No, Blessed One.”


152 Parallel: Akanuma 1929/1990: 30 mentions [[SN22.46]] at SN III 45,17 with a question
mark; in fact the discourse seems to be quite different from [[SA85]]


On the Five Aggregates (3) ─ A Translation of
_Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 59 to 87 57


[The Buddha said]: “Feeling ... perception ... formations ...
consciousness _are also like this_ . Therefore, monks, whatever bodily
form, whether past, future or present, internal or external, gross
or subtle, sublime or repugnant, far or near, all of it is not self, not
distinct from the self [in the sense of being owned by it], does not
exist [within the self, nor does a self] exist [within it]. Feeling ...
perception ... formations ... consciousness _are also like this_ .”

“Monks, a learned noble disciple examines the five aggregates of
clinging as being without a self and without what belongs to a self.

[22a] One who examines them in this way does not cling to anything
in the whole world. One who does not cling to anything is not attached
to anything. Because of not being attached to anything, he personally
realizes Nirvāṇa, [knowing]: ‘Birth for me has been eradicated, the
holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, I
myself know that there will be no receiving of further existence.’”

When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, the monks, hearing
what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.

# 86. [Discourse on Impermanence]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.

At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “If impermanent
bodily form were permanent, then it should not happen that bodily
form becomes sick and is in pain, and there should not be the pursuit
in relation to bodily form, wishing it to be in this way and not in that
way. Because bodily form is impermanent, bodily form becomes
sick and pain arises, and one gets what one does not wish to be in
this way and not in that way. Feeling ... perception ... formations ...
consciousness _are also like this_ .”

“Monks, what do you think, is bodily form permanent or impermanent?”

The monks said to the Buddha: “It is impermanent, Blessed One.”


58 法鼓佛學學報第13期（民國102年）


[The Buddha said]: “Monks, what is impermanent, is it _dukkha_ ?”

The monks said to the Buddha: “It is _dukkha_, Blessed One.”

[The Buddha said]: “Monks, what is impermanent, _dukkha_, of a
nature to change, would a learned noble disciple herein regard it as
the self, as distinct from the self [in the sense of being owned by it],
as existing [within the self, or the self] as existing [within it]?”

The monks said to the Buddha: “No, Blessed One.”

[The Buddha said]: “Feeling ... perception ... formations ...
consciousness _are also like this_ . Therefore, monks, whatever bodily
form, whether past, future or present, internal or external, gross or
subtle, sublime or repugnant, far or near, all of it is entirely without a
self and without what belongs to a self; this should be understood as it
really is. Feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness _are also_
_like this_ .

“A learned noble disciple rightly contemplates bodily form. Having
rightly contemplated it, he gives rise to disenchantment towards
bodily form, becomes dispassionate towards it, does not delight in
it, and is liberated from it. He gives rise to disenchantment towards
feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness, becomes
dispassionate towards it, does not delight in it, and is liberated from it,

[knowing]: ‘Birth for me has been eradicated, the holy life has been
established, what had to be done has been done, I myself know that
there will be no receiving of further existence.’”

When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, the monks, hearing
what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.

# 87. [Discourse on Dukkha ]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.

At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “Bodily form is
_dukkha_ . If bodily form were not _dukkha_, then it should not happen


On the Five Aggregates (3) ─ A Translation of
_Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 59 to 87 59


that bodily form becomes sick and pain arises, and one should neither
be wishing it to be in this way nor [wishing] it to be not in that way.
Therefore bodily form is _dukkha_ . Because bodily form is _dukkha_,
disease arises in bodily form and one gets the wish for bodily form
to be in this way and not in that way. [22b] Feeling ... perception ...
formations ... consciousness _are also like thi_ s.

“Monks, is bodily form permanent or impermanent?”

The monks said to the Buddha: “It is impermanent, Blessed One.”

[The Buddha said]: “Monks, what is impermanent, is it _dukkha_ ?”

The monks said to the Buddha: “It is _dukkha_, Blessed One.”

[The Buddha said]: “Monks, what is impermanent, _dukkha_, of a

form, whether past, future or present, internal or external, gross or
subtle, sublime or repugnant, far or near, all of it is entirely not self,
not distinct from the self [in the sense of being owned by it], does not
exist [within the self, nor does a self] exist [within it]. Examine it as it
really is. Feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness _are also_
_like this_ .

“A learned noble disciple attains liberation from bodily form, attains
liberation from feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness. I
say, he is liberated from birth, old age, disease, death, worry, sorrow,

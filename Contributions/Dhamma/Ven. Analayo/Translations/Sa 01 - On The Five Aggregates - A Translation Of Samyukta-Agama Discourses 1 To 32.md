- Date of Submission: 2012/06/29, Date of Review: 2012/09/01.
I am indebted to Shi Kongmu and Ken Su for their collaboration and to the journal's proof
readers for helpful suggestions.

1 The translated section comprises the first fascicle of the Taishō edition of the _Saṃyukta-_
_āgama_, T II 1a6 to 7b15, corresponding to the beginning part of the section on the
aggregates according to the reconstructed order of this collection. Generally abbreviations
in my translation are also found as such in the original. My identification of Pāli parallels
is based on Akanuma 1929/1990 and Yìnshùn 1983, in the case of Sanskrit and Uighur
fragment parallels I am indebted to Chung 2008, Tibetan parallels in Śamathadeva's
compendium of discourse quotations from the _Abhidharmakośabhāṣya_ have been
identified by Honjō 1984 and are translated by Dhammadinnā 2012, who in her footnotes
covers variations found in the Tibetan parallels. In what follows I do not attempt to
provide an exhaustive survey of all extant parallels, nor to give a thorough coverage of
variations between these and the _Saṃyukta-āgama_ discourses I translate. Instead, I only
note a few selected differences in relation to the Pāli parallel(s), which can safely be
assumed to be the most widely known versions of the respective discourses. In the case
of Sanskrit fragment parallels I quote the respective passages in the footnotes for quick
reference, since the relevant publications may not be easily accessible to all readers,
although my mode of presentation results in a loss of the often significant annotations that
accompany the original fragment editions. For reproducing the Sanskrit fragment versions,
I use 〈〉 to indicate emendation of a reading, whereas with [ ] and ( ) I follow the form the
editors have used to indicate uncertain or missing _akṣaras_ .

On the Five Aggregates (1) —
A Translation of _Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 1 to 32 5


# 1. [Discourse on Impermanence] [2]

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, [3 ] Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. [4 ] At that time the Blessed One said
to the monks:

“ You should contemplate form as impermanent. One who
contemplates like this has right insight. [5 ] One who has right insight
arouses disenchantment. One who has disenchantment eradicates


2 Parallels: [[SN22.12]] at SN III 21,4, [[SN22.51]] at SN III 51,11, Sanskrit fragment Kha ii 9a14, La Vallée Poussin 1913: 580, and an Uighur fragment, Zhāng 1996: 350. Akanuma
1929/1990: 26 also mentions [[SN22.13]] and [[SN22.14]] which strictly speaking are
parallels to the discourses that according to the final phrase in [[SA1]] should be
developed similarly in relation to the characteristics of impermanence and not-self;
cf. below note 9. For discourses 1 to 7 my reconstruction of the respective titles is
based on the _uddāna_ found after discourse 7. In case the same title applies to more
than one discourse, I have added “first”, “second”, etc., to the title, which is without
support in the respective _uddānas_ .

3 Here and elsewhere, I adopt Pāli for proper names and doctrinal terms in order
to facilitate comparison with the Pāli parallels, except for terms like Dharma and
Nirvāṇa, without thereby intending to take a position on the original language of the
_Saṃyukta-āgama_ manuscript used for translation, which according to de Jong 1981:
108 would in fact have been Sanskrit.

4 [[SN22.12]] at SN III 21,4 and [[SN22.51]] at SN III 51,11 do not give a full reference to the
location or to the Buddha addressing the monks. Thus the E [e] edition of [[SN22.12]]
reads _evaṃ me sutaṃ, sāvatthiyaṃ tatra kho_ (as do B [e] and S [e] ), after which the
discourse proper starts with _rūpaṃ, bhikkhave, aniccaṃ,_ etc., whereas C [e] has just
_sāvatthiyaṃ,_ i.e., without _evaṃ me sutaṃ_ or _tatra kho_ . The E [e] edition of [[SN22.51]]
just reads _sāvatthi, tatra voca_, B [e] has _sāvatthinidānaṃ,_ C [e] and S [e] just _sāvatthiyaṃ_ .
The full description given in [[SA1]] and thus at the outset of the _Saṃyukta-āgama_, is
thus similar to the full reference given in the first discourse in the _Saṃyutta-nikāya_,
[[SN1.1]] at SN I 1,1: _evaṃ me sutam, ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati_
_jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme._ This suggests the brief reference to _sāvatthiyaṃ_
or else at times to _sāvatthi nidānaṃ_ to be simply an abbreviation and quite probably
not a reference to the location where the discourses were collected, as suggested by
Rhys Davids 1924/1975: xif and Woodward 1930: xviif; cf. also below note 45, note
88 and note 150.

5 [[SN22.12]] at SN III 21,9 has as the subject of the sentence the learned noble disciple;
cf. also the fragment below note 7. [[SN22.51]] at SN III 51,13 refers to right view
instead of right insight. Following Yìnshùn 1983: 6 note 8, the present reference in
[[SA1]] to right insight should in fact be emended to right view.

delight and lust. One who eradicates delight and lust, I say, liberates
the mind. [6]

“In the same way contemplate feeling ... perception ... formations ...
consciousness as impermanent. One who contemplates like this has
right insight. [7 ] One who has right insight arouses disenchantment.
One who has disenchantment eradicates delight and lust. One who
eradicates delight and lust, I say, liberates the mind.

“One who has liberated the mind in this way, monks, if he wishes to
declare himself is able to declare of himself: [8 ] ‘Birth for me has been
eradicated, the holy life has been established, what had to be done
has been done, I myself know that there will be no receiving of any
further existence.’”

(Just as with contemplating impermanence, in the same way also for
_dukkha_, emptiness and not-self). [9]

Then the monks, hearing what the Buddha had said, were delighted
and received it respectfully. [10]


6 [[SN22.12]] at SN III 21,12 proceeds from being disenchanted, via being dispassionate,
to being liberated, and [[SN22.51]] at SN III 51,14 similarly from being disenchanted to
the destruction of delight and lust and thence to being liberated.

7 Cf. Kha ii 9a1-3, La Vallée Poussin 1913: 580: _sam[yakprajña]yā draṣṭavyaṃ ..._
_bhavati vistareṇa yāv ... śrutavān āryaśrāvakaḥ._

8 [[SN22.12]] at SN III 21,13 indicates that one who is liberated has the knowledge to be
liberated, followed by the standard description that birth has been eradicated, etc.
[[SN22.51]] at SN III 51,19 just mentions that the mind is well liberated.

9 The indication in [[SA1]] that in the same way three more discourses are to be
developed by replacing “impermanence” with “ _dukkha_ ”, “emptiness” and “not-self”,
has as its counterparts [[SN22.13]] and [[SN22.14]] which take up _dukkha_ and _anattā_ ;
cf. also Kha ii 9a4, La Vallée Poussin 1913: 580: _saṃskārā vijñānam anātm_, and
the Uighur fragment [[AN18]] Zhāng 1996: 350. The reference to “emptiness” in [[SA1]]
is without a parallel in these Pāli discourses, corresponding to a recurrent pattern
in _Saṃyukta-āgama_ discourses to mention “emptiness” in addition to the three
characteristics regularly listed in Pāli discourse parallels; cf. de Jong 2000: 177
and below note 43, where a reference to emptiness is also found in the Sanskrit
fragment.

10 For a discussion of how to translate the final phrase at the end of _Āgama_ discourses
cf. Anālayo 2012: 521ff.

# 2. [Discourse on Right Attention] [11]

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. At that time the Blessed One said
to the monks:

“You should give right attention to form, contemplating form as
impermanent, [12 ] knowing it as it really is. Why is that? Monks,
one who gives right attention to form, who contemplates form as
impermanent and knows it as it really is, will eradicate desire and
lust in regard to form. One who eradicates desire and lust in regard to
form, I say, liberates the mind. [13]

“In the same way you should give right attention to feeling
... perception ... formations ... consciousness, contemplating
consciousness as impermanent, knowing it as it really is. Why is that?
One who gives right attention to consciousness, who contemplates
consciousness as impermanent [and knows it as it really is], will
eradicate desire and lust in regard to consciousness. One who
eradicates desire and lust in regard to consciousness, I say, liberates
the mind. [14]

“One who has liberated the mind in this way, monks, if he wishes to
declare himself is able to declare of himself: ‘Birth for me has been
eradicated, the holy life has been established, what had to be done
has been done, I myself know that there will be no receiving of any
further existence.’


11 Parallel: [[SN22.52]] at SN III 51,30 and an Uighur fragment, Zhāng 1996: 350. Akanuma
1929/1990: 26 mentions [[SN22.15-17]] which are not parallels properly speaking,
as they do not mention _yoniso manasikāra_ and proceed from the impermanence
of each aggregate to its _dukkha_ and not-self nature as something that should be
contemplated.

12 Adopting a variant that adds 觀, in conformity with the formulation employed
afterwards in [[SA2]]

13 [[SN22.52]] at SN III 52,4 proceeds from being disenchanted to the destruction of
delight and lust and thence to being liberated.

14 [[SN22.52]] at SN III 52,26 concludes at this point and thus does not have the formula
describing full awakening in terms of birth being extinguished, etc.

(Just as with giving right attention to impermanence, in the same way
also for _dukkha_, emptiness and not-self). [15]

Then the monks, hearing what the Buddha had said, were delighted
and received it respectfully.

# 3. [First Discourse on Not Understanding] [16]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. At that time the Blessed One said
to the monks:

“Not understanding form, not having knowledge regarding it, not
eradicating [desire for] it, [1b] not being free from desire for it, one is
unable to eradicate _dukkha_ . [17 ] In the same way not understanding
feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness, not having
knowledge regarding it, not eradicating [desire for] it, not being free
from desire for it, one is unable to eradicate _dukkha_ .

“Monks, understanding form, having knowledge regarding it,
eradicating [desire for] it, being free from desire for it, one is able
to eradicate _dukkha_ . In the same way understanding feeling ...
perception ... formations ... consciousness, having knowledge
regarding it, eradicating [desire for] it, being free from desire for it,
one is able and capable to eradicate _dukkha_ .” [18]

Then the monks, hearing what the Buddha had said, were delighted
and received it respectfully.


15 Yìnshùn 1983: 6 note 11 points out that this indication to apply the same treatment
to _dukkha_, emptiness and not-self is without support in the _uddāna_, which only
mentions a single discourse on 正思惟 .

16 Parallels: [[SN22.24]] at SN III 26,29, Hoernle fragment H 150/69 (Or. 15002/13) Av-w,
fragment SHT IV 30a V1-4, Sander 1980: 77, and an Uighur fragment, Zhāng 1996:
350.

17 [[SN22.24]] at SN III 27,1 speaks of not directly knowing ( _abhi + jānāti_ ), not fully
understanding ( _pari + jānāti_ ), not becoming dispassionate and not abandoning.

18 SHT IV 30a V1, Sander 1980: 77: _(sam)y(ag)du_ .

# 4. [Second Discourse on Not Understanding] [19]

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. At that time the Blessed One said
to the monks:

“Not understanding form, not having knowledge regarding it, not
eradicating [desire for] it, not being free from desire for it, one will
not liberate mind and be unable to go beyond the dread of birth, old
age, disease and death. [20 ] In the same way not understanding feeling
... perception ... formations ... consciousness, not having knowledge
regarding it, not eradicating [desire for] it, not being free from desire
for it, one will not liberate the mind and be unable to go beyond the
dread of birth, old age, disease and death.

“Monks, understanding form, having knowledge regarding it,

eradicating [desire for] it, [21] being free from desire for it, one is able
to go beyond the dread of birth, old age, disease and death. [22 ]

Monks, understanding it, having knowledge regarding it, being free
from desire and lust for it, one will liberate the mind and be able
to go beyond the dread of birth, old age, disease and death. [23 ] In
the same way understanding feeling ... perception ... formations ...
consciousness, having knowledge regarding it, eradicating [desire for]
it, being free from desire and lust for it, one will liberate the mind and
be able to go beyond the dread of birth, old age, disease and death.”

Then the monks, hearing what the Buddha had said, were delighted
and received it respectfully.


19 Parallels: Hoernle fragment H 150/69 (Or. 15002/13) Ax-z and fragment SHT IV
30aV2-4, Sander 1980: 77. Akanuma 1929/1990: 26 mentions [[SN35.27]] yet this
discourse is not on the five aggregates, but on the six senses, etc.

20 SHT IV 30a V2, Sander 1980: 77: _[y]āvi[rāgayi]tvā abhavyo jātijarāmaraṇa(bhayaṃ)_
_sama[ti]kkramit(tuṃ)._

21 SHT IV 30a V3, Sander 1980: 77: _(sa)matikkra[mitu](ṃ) r[ū]pan tu bhikṣa[vaḥ]_
_abhijñāya [pa](r)[ijñā]ya prahāya._

22 SHT IV 30a V4, Sander 1980: 77: _[bhav]yo [jātijarāmaraṇabhaya]ṃ [sama](t)_
_i(kkramit)um._

23 Yìnshùn 1983: 9 note 2 points out that the repetitive part in this section seems to be
out of place, hence in his edition of the text this part is left out.

# 5. [Third Discourse on Not Understanding] [24]

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. At that time the Blessed One said
to the monks:

“One who craves for and delights in form, craves for and delights in
_dukkha_ . One who craves for and delights in _dukkha_ will not attain
liberation from _dukkha_, will not have knowledge and become free
from desire for it. [25 ] In the same way one who craves for and delights
in feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness craves for and
delights in _dukkha_ . One who craves for and delights in _dukkha_ will
not attain liberation from _dukkha_ .

“Monks, one who does not crave for or delight in form, does not
delight in _dukkha_ . One who does not delight in _dukkha_ will attain
liberation from _dukkha_ . In the same way one who does not crave
for or delight in feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness
does not delight in _dukkha_ . One who does not delight in _dukkha_ will
attain liberation from _dukkha_ . [26]

“Monks, not understanding form, not having knowledge regarding
it, not being free from desire and lust for it, the mind will not be
liberated. One who has not liberated the mind from lust will not


24 Parallels: [[SN22.29]] at SN III 31,11, Hoernle fragment H 150/69 (Or. 15002/13) Az-B3,
fragment SHT IV 30a V4-7, Sander 1980: 77, and an Uighur fragment, Zhāng 1996:
350; cf. also below [[SA7]]

25 The reference to knowledge and dispassion at T II 1b19 might be the result
of a textual error, as it is not repeated in the rest of [[SA5]] and is also without a
counterpart in the otherwise similar description in [[SN22.29]] In fact Yìnshùn 1983:
9 note 3 suggests that this whole part is redundant, that is, the discourse proper
would only start with the paragraph at T II 1b24 on “not understanding bodily form”,
etc., and in his edition of [[SA5]] this part is left out.

26 [[SN22.29]] at SN III 31,28 concludes at this point and thus does not have a counterpart
to the remainder of [[SA5]] Therefore [[SN22.29]] would strictly speaking be a closer
parallel to [[SA7]] see below.

27 Yìnshùn 1983: 9 note 4 points out that the reference to having liberated the mind
“from lust” appears superfluous, as the preceding statement has not mentioned it,
hence in his edition of the text the character 貪 is at this point left out.

will not liberate the mind and will not be able to eradicate _dukkha_ .

“Understanding form, having knowledge regarding it, being free from
desire and lust for it, one will attain liberation of the mind and be
able to eradicate _dukkha_ . [29 ] In the same way understanding feeling

regarding it, being free from desire and lust for it, one will attain
liberation of the mind and be able to eradicate _dukkha_ .” [1c]

Then the monks, hearing what the Buddha had said, were delighted
and received it respectfully.

# 6. [Fourth Discourse on Not Understanding] [30]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. At that time the Blessed One said
to the monks:

“Not understanding form, not having knowledge regarding it, not
being free from desire and lust for it, one will not liberate the mind
and will be unable to go beyond the dread of birth, old age, disease
and death. In the same way not understanding feeling ... perception ...
formations ... consciousness, [31 ] not having knowledge regarding it, not
being free from desire and lust for it, one will not liberate the mind

# 7. [Discourse on Delighting in Form] [34]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. At that time the Blessed One said
to the monks:

“One who craves for and delights in form, craves for and delights
in _dukkha_ . One who craves for and delights in _dukkha_ will not
attain liberation from _dukkha_ . In the same way one who craves for
and delights in feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness

# 8. [Discourse on the Past] [38]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. At that time the Blessed One said
to the monks:

“In the past form was impermanent and in the future it will be

and does not rejoice in form in the future. [40] Being disenchanted
with form in the present, [41] he becomes free from desire and rightly
progresses towards cessation.

“In the same way in the past feeling ... perception ... formations

[impermanent], what to say of consciousness in the present! A
noble disciple who contemplates like this is not concerned with
consciousness in the past and does not rejoice in consciousness in the
future. [42] Being disenchanted with consciousness in the present, he
becomes free from desire and rightly progresses towards cessation.”
(Just as with impermanence, in the same way also for _dukkha_,
emptiness and not-self) [43]

Then the monks, hearing what the Buddha had said, [2a] were
delighted and received it respectfully.

the other aggregates.

43 SHT IV 30a R7, Sander 1980: 78: _(e)vaṃ duḥkhaṃ śunyam anātmā_ . The indication
in the fragment and in [[SA8]] that in the same way three more discourses are to be
developed by replacing “impermanence” with “ _dukkha_ ” and “not-self” has as its
counterpart [[SN22.10]] and [[SN22.11]] which take up _dukkha_ and _anattā_ ; cf. also the
similar case of [[SA1]] above note 9. The discourse quotation in Pradhan 1967: 464,5
is in fact just on the treatment by way of not self, _rūpam anātmā yāvad vijñānam_
_anātme ti_ and thus parallels [[SN22.11]] as is the case for the Tibetan parallel, [[DN4094]]
_nyu_ 77b4 or Q 5595 _thu_ 123a3.

between the abbreviation in the Sanskrit fragment and the full formula in [[SA9]]

“If living beings did not find gratification in form, they would not get

are defiled [by form] and attached [to it]. [63] In the same way, if living
beings did not find gratification in feeling ... perception ... formations ...
consciousness, they would not get defiled by consciousness. Because
living beings find gratification in feeling ... perception ... formations ...

“Monks, if living beings did not experience the danger in form,
those living beings would not become disenchanted with form.
Because living beings [experience] the danger in form, those living
beings become disenchanted with form. In the same way, if they did

# 15. [Discourse on the Underling Tendencies] [72]

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī
in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. At that time a certain monk
approached the Buddha, paid homage with his head at the Buddha's
feet, withdrew to stand at one side and said to the Buddha:

“It would be well if the Blessed One would now teach me the
essentials of the Dharma in brief. On having heard the Dharma I shall
practice alone in a quiet place without negligence. Having practiced
without negligence I shall in turn reflect on that for whose sake a
clansman's son goes forth, shaving off beard and hair and putting
Dharma robes on the body, out of faith going forth from the home to
homelessness for the unsurpassed supreme holy life, realizing here
and now that ‘birth for me has been eradicated, the holy life has been
established, what had to be done has been done, I myself know that
there will be no receiving of any further existence.’” [73]

At that time the Blessed One said to that monk: “It is well, it is well,
monk, that you right away speak these words, saying: ‘Would you
teach me the essentials of the Dharma in brief. On having heard the
Dharma I shall practice alone in a quiet place without negligence ...
up to ... knowing myself that there will be no receiving of any further
existence.’ Are you speaking like this?” The monk said to the Buddha:
“It is like this, Blessed One.”

meaning of the teaching I herein spoke in brief?” The monk said to

74 The expression 隨使死 in [[SA15]] at T II 3a18 has its counterpart in _anumīyati_ in [[SN22.36]] at SN III 36,17. As observed by Schmithausen 1987/2007: 529 note 1426 (noted

_marantena anusayena anusarati._

75 The instruction in [[SN22.36]] at SN III 36,17, after pointing out that one is measured
by what one has an underlying tendency for, continues by indicating that one is
reckoned in terms of by what one is measured.

88 Kha ii 10a, Chung 2008: 318,1 (here and below, line references are to the actual
text of the edition): _śrāvastyān nidānam._ The difference in formulation between
the abbreviation in the Sanskrit fragment and the full formula in [[SA16]] supports my
suggestion made above in note 4 and note 45 and below note 150 that expressions
like _śrāvastyāṃ nidānam or rājagṛhe nidānaṃ_ were probably not intended to
refer to the place where the discourses were collected, but rather served as an
abbreviation of the full description of the location where the discourse was held to
have taken place.

89 The Sanskrit fragment parallel, Kha ii 10a, Chung 2008: 318,2, gives the introductory
narration in full.

90 [[SA16]] at T II 3b16: 增諸數, which has as its counterpart _saṅkhaṃ gacchati_ in [[SN22.35]] at SN III 35,8 and the corresponding expression _saṃkhyāṃ gacchati_ in the
Sanskrit fragment Kha ii 10a, Chung 2008: 318,11, where the full line reads: _yad_
_anunīyate tenaiva saṃkhyāṃ ga(c)[ch](at)[i]._ I have followed the Fóguāng ( 佛光 )
edition of the _Saṃyukta-āgama_, page 21 note 6, which seems to take the whole
phrase 增諸數 as expressing the meaning _saṃkhyāṃ√gam_, even though 數 would
on its own already render _saṃkhyāṃ√gam_ (cf. Hirakawa 1997: 576) and 增 is a
standard rendering of _vṛddhi_, etc. Evidently the translator had difficulties with the
expression in the Indic original, which he perhaps thought to carry the meaning of
increasing the number of births in _saṃsāra_ .

‘birth for me has been eradicated, the holy life has been established,
what had to be done has been done, I myself know that there will be

see so that in regard to this body with consciousness and external signs the mind
is rid of I-making, mine-making, and conceit, transcends discrimination, is peaceful
and well liberated.

At that time the Blessed One said to that monk: “It is well, it is well,
that you are able to ask the Tathāgata about the mind being well
liberated. It is well, Kappa. Listen, listen and pay careful attention to
what I will tell you.

“Kappa, you should contemplate with understanding that whatever
form, whether past, future or present, internal or external, gross or
subtle, sublime or repugnant, far or near, all [form], every instance of
it, is impermanent. Having rightly contemplated it as impermanent,
you will remove craving for form. Having removed craving for form,
your mind will be well liberated. [5a]

“In the same way contemplating [whatever] feeling ... perception
... formations ... consciousness, whether past, future or present,
internal or external, gross or subtle, sublime or repugnant, far or
near, all [consciousness], every instance of it, is impermanent. Having
rightly contemplated it as impermanent, you will remove craving for
consciousness. Having removed craving for consciousness, I say, your
mind will be well liberated.

“Kappa, a monk who in this way has well liberated the mind is
reckoned by the Tathāgata to have well liberated the mind. Why is
that? Because of having eradicated craving and desire. One who has
eradicated craving and desire is reckoned by the Tathāgata to have
well liberated the mind.”

Then, on hearing what the Buddha had said, the mind of the monk
Kappa was greatly delighted. He paid homage to the Buddha
and withdrew. At that time the monk Kappa, having received the
Buddha's instruction, reflecting on it alone in a quiet place with
diligence and being established in it without negligence ... up to ... he
himself knew that there will be no receiving of any further existence.
Having well liberated the mind he became an arahant.

# 23. [First Discourse on Rāhula's Question] [113]

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha
in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Feeding Place. At that time the
venerable Rāhula approached the Buddha, paid homage with his
head at the [Buddha's] feet and withdrew to stand at one side. He said
to the Buddha:

“Blessed One, knowing what, seeing what in relation to this body
of mine with consciousness and [in relation to] external objects and
any sign will it be possible that there is no [sense of an] I, of viewing
as mine or of the underlying tendency, fetter and attachment to the
I-conceit?”

The Buddha said to Rāhula: “It is well, it is well, that you are able
to ask the Tathāgata: ‘Knowing what, seeing what in relation to this
body of mine with consciousness and [in relation to] external objects
and any sign will there be no [sense of an] I, of viewing as mine or of
the underlying tendency, fetter and attachment to the I-conceit?’ Is it
like this?” Rāhula said to the Buddha: “It is like this, Blessed One.”

The Buddha said to Rāhula: “It is well. Listen, listen and pay careful
attention to what I will tell you. Rāhula, you should contemplate
whatever form, whether past, future or present, internal or external,
gross or subtle, sublime or repugnant, far or near, all such [form],
every instance of it, is not self, is not distinct from the self [in the
sense of being owned by it], does not exist [within the self nor does a
self] exist [within it]. [114] In this way it should be rightly contemplated
with balanced wisdom.

indebted to Choong 2000: 59,who draws attention to [[SA45]] at T II 11b5: 色是我, 色
異我, 我在色, 色在我, which is then summarized two lines later as 色是我, 異我, 相在 ;

“In the same way [whatever] feeling ... perception ... formations
... consciousness, whether past, future or present, internal or
external, gross or subtle, sublime or repugnant, far or near, all such

[consciousness], every instance of it, is not self, is not distinct from the
self [in the sense of being owned by it], does not exist [within the self
nor does a self] exist [within it]. In this way it should be contemplated
with balanced wisdom as it really is.

“In this way, Rāhula, a monk knows like this and sees like this. For
one who knows like this and sees like this in relation to this body
with consciousness and [in relation to] external objects and any
sign there will be no [sense of an] I, viewing as mine or underlying
tendency, fetter and attachment to the I-conceit. [115]

“Rāhula, if in this way for a monk in relation to this body with
consciousness and [in relation to] external objects and any sign there
is no [sense of an] I, [5b] viewing as mine or underlying tendency,
fetter and attachment to the I-conceit, that monk is reckoned to have
eradicated craving and desire, to have turned around and left all
bondage, rightly comprehending [116] the unsurpassed transcendence
of _dukkha_ .”

Then Rāhula, hearing what the Buddha had said, was delighted and
received it respectfully.

# 24. [Second Discourse on Rāhula's Question] [117]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha
in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Feeding Place. At that time the
Blessed One said to Rāhula [and the monks]:

“Monks, knowing what, seeing what in relation to this body of mine
with consciousness and [in relation to] external objects and any sign
will there be no [sense of an] I, viewing as mine and underlying
tendency, fetter and attachment to the I-conceit?”

Rāhula said to the Buddha: “The Blessed One is the master of the
Dharma, being its guide and its shelter. It would be well if the Blessed
One were to deliver an explanation of the meaning [of this statement]
to the monks. Having heard it from the Buddha, the monks will
remember it and receive it respectfully.”

The Buddha said to Rāhula: “Listen, listen and pay careful attention
to what I will tell you.” Rāhula said to the Buddha: “Indeed, we [are
ready] to receive the instruction.”

The Buddha said to Rāhula: “You should contemplate whatever form,
whether past, future or present, internal or external, gross or subtle,
sublime or repugnant, far or near, all such [form] is not self, is not
distinct from the self [in the sense of being owned by it], does not
exist [within the self nor does a self] exist [within it]. In this way it
should be contemplated with balanced wisdom as it really is.

“In the same way [whatever] feeling ... perception ... formations

“Monks, knowing like this and seeing like this in relation to this

underlying tendency, fetter and attachment to the I-conceit. ” [118]

“Rāhula, [when] in this way in relation to this body with consciousness
and [in relation to] external objects and any sign there is no [sense of
an] I, viewing as mine and underlying tendency, fetter and attachment
to the I-conceit, [then] a monk goes beyond doubt in his mind, is far
removed from all signs, being at peace and liberated. Such a monk
is reckoned to have eradicated and removed craving and desire, to
have turned around and left all bondage, rightly comprehending the
unsurpassed transcendence of _dukkha_ .”

Then Rāhula [and the monks], hearing what the Buddha had said,
were delighted and received it respectfully. [119]

# 25. [Discourse on Being Learned] [120]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. Then a certain monk approached
the Buddha, paid homage to the Buddha and withdrew to stand at
one side. [5c] He said to the Buddha: “As the Blessed One has spoken
about being learned – how does one [become] learned?”

The Buddha said to the monk: “It is well, it is well. You are now
asking me the meaning of being learned. Is it like this?” The monk
said to the Buddha: “Indeed, Blessed One.”

The Buddha said to the monk: “Listen and pay careful attention
to what I will tell you. Monk, you should know that hearing that
whereby disenchantment with form arises, whereby one is free
from desire for it, whereby there is cessation and a state of peace,
this is reckoned being learned. In the same way hearing that
whereby disenchantment with feeling ... perception ... formations ...


119 After the conclusion of this discourse comes a summary verse ( _uddāna_ ), which I
have not included in the translation.

120 No parallel seems so far to have been identified. For discourses 25 to 29 my
reconstruction of the respective discourse titles is based on the _uddāna_ found after
discourse 29.

consciousness arises, whereby one is free from desire for it, whereby
there is cessation and a state of peace, this is reckoned being learned.
Monk, this is reckoned what the Tathāgata declares to be learned.”

Then that monk, hearing what the Buddha had said, was thrilled with
delight, paid homage and left.

# 26. [Discourse on Teaching the Dharma Well] [121]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī
in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. At that time a certain monk
approached the Buddha, paid homage with his head at the [Buddha's]
feet and withdrew to stand at one side. He said to the Buddha: “As
the Blessed One has spoken about being a Dharma teacher – how is
one reckoned a Dharma teacher?”

The Buddha said to the monk: “It is well, it is well. You now wish
to know the meaning of what the Tathāgata has spoken about as a
Dharma teacher. Is it like this?” The monk said to the Buddha: “Indeed,
Blessed One.”

The Buddha said to the monk: “Listen and pay careful attention to
what I will tell you.” The Buddha said to the monk: “If by teaching
about form disenchantment arises, one is free from desire for [form]
and there is cessation and a state of peace, this is reckoned being
a Dharma teacher. [122] If by teaching about feeling ... perception ...
formations ... consciousness disenchantment arises, one is free from
desire for [consciousness] and there is cessation and a state of peace,


121 Parallel: [[SN22.115]] at SN III 163,14. Akanuma 1929/1990: 27 also mentions [[SN22.116]] which combines the inquiry after the Dharma teacher with a question
about practising in accordance with the Dharma and attaining Nirvāṇa in this very
life, hence [[SN22.115]] is the closer parallel to [[SA26]] in as much as its inquiry only
takes up the Dharma teacher, even though the Buddha then expounds all three
topics.

122 [[SN22.115]] at SN III 163,21 continues after the definition of the Dharma teacher by
explaining two more topics: how one practices in accordance with the Dharma
and how one attains Nirvāṇa in this very life.

this is reckoned being a Dharma teacher. This is reckoned what the
Tathāgata declares to be a Dharma teacher.”

Then that monk, hearing what the Buddha had said, was thrilled with
delight, paid homage and left.

# 27. [Discourse on Proceeding in the Dharma] [123]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī
in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. At that time a certain monk
approached the Buddha, paid homage with his head at the [Buddha's]
feet and withdrew to stand at one side. He said to the Buddha: “As
the Blessed One has spoken about proceeding in the Dharma in
accordance with the Dharma – how does one proceed in the Dharma
in accordance with the Dharma?” [124]

The Buddha said to the monk: “It is well, it is well. You now wish to
know how to proceed in the Dharma in accordance with the Dharma.
Is it like this?” The monk said to the Buddha: “Indeed, Blessed One.”

The Buddha said to the monk: “Listen and pay careful attention to
what I will tell you. Monk, proceeding towards disenchantment
in regard to form, towards being free from desire for it, towards
its cessation, this is reckoned proceeding in the Dharma in
accordance with the Dharma. [125] In the same way proceeding towards
disenchantment in regard to feeling ... perception ... formations ...
consciousness, towards being free from desire for it, towards its
cessation, this is reckoned proceeding in the Dharma in accordance
with the Dharma.”


123 Parallel: [[SN22.39]] at SN III 40,22. Akanuma 1929/1990: 27 also mentions [[SN22.4042]] which develop the same treatment with the alternatives of contemplating
impermanence, _dukkha_ and not-self. Thus [[SN22.39]] is the closest parallel to [[SA27]]

124 [[SN22.39]] at SN III 40,23 begins with the Buddha delivering the instruction on his
own, without anyone asking a corresponding question.

125 [[SN22.39]] at SN III 40,28 proceeds from disenchantment with the five aggregates
to their full understanding and to being liberated from them, whereby one is also
liberated from birth, old age and death, etc.

# 28. [Discourse on Nirvāṇa] [126]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in
Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. [6a] At that time a certain monk
approached the Buddha, paid homage with his head at the [Buddha's]
feet and withdrew to stand at one side. He said to the Buddha: “As
the Blessed One has spoken about attaining Nirvāṇa here and now –
how does a monk attain Nirvāṇa here and now?” [127]

The Buddha said to the monk: “It is well, it is well. You now wish to
know about Nirvāṇa here and now. Is it like this?” The monk said to
the Buddha: “Indeed, Blessed One.”

The Buddha said to the monk: “Listen and pay careful attention
to what I will tell you.” The Buddha said to the monk: “Arousing
disenchantment for form, being free from desire for it, [proceeding
towards] its cessation, without giving rise to the influxes, the mind
is rightly liberated. This is reckoned how a monk [attains] Nirvāṇa
here and now. In the same way arousing disenchantment for feeling
... perception ... formations ... consciousness, being free from desire
for it, [proceeding towards] its cessation, without giving rise to the
influxes, the mind is rightly liberated. This is reckoned how a monk

[attains] Nirvāṇa here and now.”


126 Parallels: [[SN22.116]] at SN III 164,3 and a discourse quotation in the
_Abhidharmakośabhāṣya_, Pradhan 1967: 93,21, with a fuller quotation preserved in
Tibetan, [[DN4094]] _ju_ 97b3 or Q 5595 _tu_ 111b1, translated below Dhammadinnā 2012:
83. Akanuma 1929/1990: 27 also mentions [[SN22.115]] (cf. above note 121) and [[SN35.154]] which takes up the six sense-spheres instead of the aggregates in its reply.

127 My rendering is based on emending [[SA28]] at T II 6a3: 得見法涅槃 to 見法得涅槃,
in line with the Sanskrit parallel, Pradhan 1967: 93,21: _dṛṣṭadharmanirvāṇaprāpto_
_bhikṣur ity uktaṃ_ . In [[SN22.116]] at SN III 164,7 the topic of attaining Nirvāṇa here
and now is the third of three topics broached by the monk, the other two are the
Dharma teacher and practising in accordance with the Dharma.

the name of Samiddhi approached the Buddha, paid homage with his
head at the [Buddha's] feet and withdrew to stand at one side. He said
to the Buddha: “As the Blessed One has spoken about speaking as a
Dharma teacher – how is one reckoned to be speaking as a Dharma
teacher?”

The Buddha said to the monk: “You now wish to know the meaning
of speaking as a Dharma teacher. Is it like this?” The monk said to the
Buddha: “Indeed, Blessed One.”

The Buddha said to the monk: “Listen and pay careful attention to
what I will tell you. If a monk speaks of disenchantment in regard to
form, of being free from desire for it, of its cessation, this is reckoned
speaking as a Dharma teacher. [129] In the same way speaking of
disenchantment in regard to feeling ... perception ... formations ...
consciousness, of being free from desire for it, of its cessation, this is
reckoned speaking as a Dharma teacher.”

# 30. [First Discourse to Soṇa] [131]

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha
in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Feeding Place. At that time the
venerable Sāriputta was on Mount Vulture Peak. Then a householder's
son by the name of Soṇa, who every day used to roam around,
reached Mount Vulture Peak and approached the venerable Sāriputta.
Having exchanged polite greetings he withdrew to sit at one side. He
said to Sāriputta: [132]

“If recluses and brahmins in regard to form which is impermanent
and changing, form which is not stable, say: ‘I am superior, I am
equal, I am inferior’; why do these recluses and brahmins have such
a perception and do not see the truth? [133] [6b]

“If recluses and brahmins in regard to feeling ... perception ...

131 Parallels: [[SN22.49]] at SN III 48,5 and fragment MSS Bendall xix,7 and xxi,2, La
Vallée Poussin 1907: 375-377. For discourses 30 to 32 my reconstruction of the
titles is based on the _uddāna_ found after discourse [[SA262]] at T II 67a20 in what
according to the reconstructed order of the _Saṃyukta-āgama_ would be the second
fascicle of the collection. The _uddāna_ begins with a reference to three discourses
to Soṇa, 輸屢那三種 .

132 MSS Bendall, La Vallée Poussin 1907: 375,1 (counting the lines from the beginning
of the actual fragment): _śāriputra idam avocat_ . Thus here Śāriputra right away
comes out with a teaching (on the recluses and brahmins). [[SN22.49]] at SN III 48,11
similarly does not report Soṇa asking about the recluses and brahmins, but rather
being taught about them, although here he has visited the Buddha instead of
Sāriputta and thus receives teachings from the Buddha.

133 MSS Bendall, La Vallée Poussin 1907: 375,1: _ye ke cic chroṇa śramaṇā vā brāhmaṇā_

_te śroṇa śramaṇā vā brāhmaṇā vā evaṃ yathābhūtasyādarśanāt_ . The present
section of [[SA30]] has been translated by Choong 2000: 60, who p. 59 already noted
that in the Pāli parallel [[SN22.49]] this part is not a question asked by Soṇa, but a
teaching given by the Buddha; cf. also above note 132.

“If recluses and brahmins in regard to form which is impermanent
and not stable, form which is changing, say: ‘I am superior, I am
equal, I am inferior’; why do they imagine [like this] and do not
see the truth? In regard to feeling ... perception ... formations ...
consciousness which is impermanent and changing, which is not
stable, they say: ‘I am superior, I am equal, I am inferior’. Why do
they imagine [like this] and do not see the truth?”

[Sāriputta asked]: “Soṇa, what do you think, is form permanent or is it
impermanent?” [Soṇa] replied: “It is impermanent.” [135]

[Sāriputta asked]: “Soṇa, what is impermanent, is it _dukkha_ ?” [Soṇa]
replied: “It is _dukkha_ .” [136]

[Sāriputta asked]: “Soṇa, what is impermanent, _dukkha_, of a nature to
change, what do you think, does a noble disciple herein regard such
form as self, as distinct from the self [in the sense of being owned by
it], as existing [within the self, or the self] as existing [within it]?” [Soṇa]
replied: “No.” [137]

[Sāriputta asked]: “Soṇa, what do you think, is feeling ... perception ...
formations ... consciousness permanent or is it impermanent?” [Soṇa]

_nānyatra te śroṇa śramaṇā vā brāhmaṇā vā evaṃ yābhūtasyādarśanād._ The
fragment continues with the positive case of recluses and brahmins who have no
such notions of being superior, equal or inferior.

[Sāriputta asked]: “What is impermanent, is it _dukkha_ ?” [Soṇa] replied:
“It is _dukkha_ .” [139]

[Sāriputta asked]: “Soṇa, consciousness that is impermanent, _dukkha_,
of a nature to change, what do you think, does a noble disciple
herein regard such consciousness as self, as distinct from the self [in
the sense of being owned by it], as existing [within the self, or the
self] as existing [within it]?” [Soṇa] replied: “No.” [140]

[Sāriputta said]: “Soṇa you should know that [whatever] form, whether
past, future or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, sublime
or repugnant, far or near, all such form is not self, is not distinct from
the self [in the sense of being owned by it], does not exist [within the
self nor does a self] exist [within it]. This is reckoned knowing it as it
really is. [141]

“In the same way [whatever] feeling ... perception ... formations

“Soṇa, in this way arouse disenchantment in regard to form ... feeling

and become liberated. [143] Being liberated you will know and see that:
‘Birth for me has been eradicated, the holy life has been established,

no receiving of any further existence.’” [144]

When Sāriputta had spoken this discourse, the householder's son
Soṇa attained the pure eye of Dharma that is remote from [mental]
stains and free from [mental] dust. Then the householder's son Soṇa
saw the Dharma and attained the Dharma, not needing to rely on
others he had attained fearlessness in the right Dharma. [145] He rose
from his seat, arranged his clothes so as to bare the right shoulder,
knelt down and with palms together said to Sāriputta: [146]

“I have now crossed over. From now on I take refuge in the Buddha,
I take refuge in the Dharma and take refuge in the Saṅgha as a lay
follower. [6c] From today until the end of my life I purely take refuge
in the three jewels.” [147]

Then the householder's son Soṇa, hearing what Sāriputta had said,
was thrilled with delight, paid homage and left. [148]

# 31. [Second Discourse to Soṇa] [149]


Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha
in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Feeding Place. [150] At that time the
venerable Sāriputta was on Mount Vulture Peak.

Then a householder's son by the name of Soṇa, who every day used
to roam around, reached Mount Vulture Peak and approached the
venerable Sāriputta. He paid homage with his head at [Sāriputta's feet]
and withdrew to sit at one side. [151]

Then Sāriputta said: [152] “Soṇa, if recluses and brahmins do not know
form as it really is, do not know the arising of form as it really is, do
not know the cessation of form as it really is, do not know the path to
the cessation of form as it really is, then, Soṇa, you should know that

with the Sanskrit fragments).

150 MSS Bendall, Chung 2008: 321,1 (here and below, line references are to the actual
text of the edition), instead begins with just _rājagṛhe nidānaṃ_ ; cf. also above note
4, note 45 and note 88.

An exposition similar to [[SA31]] but addressed by the Buddha to the monks, can
be found in fragment Kha ii 1d/10c/12a r3-7, La Vallée Poussin 1913: 575f. The
fragment differs from [[SA31]] but agrees with [[SN22.50]] by indicating that recluses
and brahmins who do not know bodily form, etc., its arising, its cessation and the
path to its cessation, are not [real] recluses and brahmins and do not realize the
essence of being recluses and brahmins.

impermanent?” [Soṇa] replied: “It is impermanent.” [157]

replied: “It is _dukkha_ .”

Sāriputta said: “Form that is impermanent, _dukkha_, of a nature to
change, would a noble disciple herein regard such form as self, as
distinct from the self [in the sense of being owned by it], as existing

[within the self, or the self] as existing [within it]?” [Soṇa] replied: “No.”

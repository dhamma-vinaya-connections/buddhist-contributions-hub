# On the Six Sense-spheres (2) — A Translation of Saṃyukta-āgama Discourses 230 to 249 [∗]

Bhikkhu Anālayo


Professor, Numata Center for Buddhist Studies


University of Hamburg, Germany

### Introduction

In this article I translate the first half of the ninth fascicle of the
_Saṃyukta-āgama_, which contains discourses 230 to 249. [1]


∗ 2018/8/25 收稿，2018/12/1 通過審稿。

1 After an interruption due to needing to attend to other work, with this article

I continue my translation of fascicles of the _Saṃyukta-āgama_, published

from 2012 to 2016. In what follows, I depart from the approach adopted in

those previous instalments by taking up only half of a fascicle at a time. I

also no longer supplement a title for each discourse. Titles can be

reconstructed for the first five fascicles, as _uddāna_ s are preserved. But for

the remainder of the _Saṃyukta-āgama_ there is really no proper basis for

giving a title. I also no longer quote all relevant Sanskrit fragment parallels

in full, but only provide a full quote when this seems to me to be of relevance

from a comparative perspective. Another change is that I translate

equivalents to _bhikkhu/bhikṣu_ as “monastic”, rather than as “monk”, in order

to reflect the fact that the usage of the original term is not necessarily a

referent to fully ordained males, but often has a broader sense; cf. Collett

and Anālayo 2014. The translated text is found at T II 56a24 to 60a21, which

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at
Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.

Then a monastic by the name of Samiddhi approached the
Buddha, paid respect with his head at the Buddha’s feet,
withdrew to sit to one side, and said to the Buddha: “Blessed
One, it is said: ‘the world’. What is called ‘the world’?”

The Buddha said to Samiddhi: “That is, the eye, forms, eyeconsciousness, eye-contact, and feeling arisen in dependence on
eye-contact and experienced within, be it painful, pleasant, or
neutral, [that is called ‘the world’].

“The ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind,


is the first part of the ninth fascicle in the Taishō edition corresponding to

the ninth fascicle in the reconstructed order of this collection. In what

follows, my identification of Pāli parallels is based on Akanuma 1929/1990

and Yìnshùn 1983; in the case of Sanskrit fragment parallels. I am indebted

to Chung 2008. Here and elsewhere, I adopt Pāli for proper names and

doctrinal terms in order to facilitate comparison with the Pāli parallels,

except for terms like Dharma and Nirvāṇa, without thereby intending to take

a position on the original language of the _Saṃyukta-āgama_ manuscript used

for translation.

2 Parallel: [[SN35.68]] at SN IV 39,28. An extract from [[SA230]] has already been

translated by Choong 2000: 85.

mental objects, mind-consciousness, mind-contact, and feeling
arisen in dependence on mind-contact and experienced within,

[56b] be it painful, pleasant, or neutral, that is called ‘the world’.
Why is that? With the arising of the six sense-spheres there is
the arising of contact, _in this way_ … _up to_ … the arising of this
entire great mass of _dukkha_ . [3]

“Samiddhi, if there is not that eye, no forms, no eyeconsciousness, no eye-contact, and no feeling arisen in
dependence on eye-contact and experienced within, be it painful,
pleasant, or neutral, [then there is no world and also no
designating of a ‘world’].

“[If] there is no ear … [no] nose … [no] tongue … [no]
body …[no] mind, [no] mental objects, [no] mind-consciousness,

[no] mind-contact, and [no] feeling arisen in dependence on
mind-contact and experienced within, be it painful, pleasant, or
neutral, then there is no world and also no designating of a
‘world’. Why is that? With the cessation of the six sense-spheres
there is the cessation of contact, _in this way_ … _up to_ … therefore
there is the cessation of this entire great mass of _dukkha_ .”


3 [[SN35.68]] does not continue from defining the world by way of the six senses

(a definition that does not mention contact and the three feelings) to the

dependent arising (or later cessation) of _dukkha_ .

When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the
Buddha had said the monastics were delighted and received it
respectfully.

_Just as_ _for_ ‘the world’, _in the same way [discourses] are also to_
_be recited in the same way for ‘_ a living being’ _and in the same_
_way for_ ‘Māra’.

## 231) [4]

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at
Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.

Then a monastic by the name of Samiddhi approached the
Buddha, paid respect with his head at the Buddha’s feet,
withdrew to sit to one side, and said to the Buddha: “Blessed
One, it is said: ‘the world’. What is called ‘the world’?”


4 Parallel: [[SN35.82]] at SN IV 52,3 and [[SN35.84]] at SN IV 53,10 (which have

as their protagonists an unnamed monastic or Ānanda respectively), and a

discourse quotation in the _Abhidharmakośabhāṣya_, Pradhan 1967: 5,16, and

in Śamathadeva’s _Abhidharmakośopāyikā-ṭīkā_, Up 1010 at [[DN4094]] _ju_ 12b3

or Q 5595 _tu_ 13b8; translated by Dhammadinnā 2018: 88–90. Of the two

Pāli versions, [[SN35.84]] could be considered a closer parallel insofar as it

explains the world to be “of the nature” to be broken up, whereas [[SN35.82]]

just speaks of the world being broken up, without employing the phrase “of

the nature” (given that [[SA231]] although irregularly, does employ the phrase

“of the nature”).


On the Six Sense-spheres (2) — A Translation of _Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 230 to 249  79


The Buddha said to Samiddhi: “What is [of a nature to be]
broken up and destroyed is called ‘the world’. [5] What is [of a
nature to be] broken up and destroyed? Samiddhi, the eye is of a
nature to be broken up and destroyed, likewise forms, eyeconsciousness, eye-contact, and feeling arisen in dependence on
eye-contact and experienced within, be it painful, pleasant, or
neutral, all that is also [of a nature] to be broken up and destroyed.

“The ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind _is_
_also like that._ This is said to be of a nature to be broken up and
destroyed; this is called ‘the world’.”

When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the
Buddha had said the monastic Samiddhi was delighted and
received it respectfully.

## 232) [6]


5 In the Pāli parallels, the explanation involves a playful etymology, where

the world, _loka_, is explained with the term _lujjati_, “to break up” ([[SN35.82]]),

or else with the term _palokadhamma_, “of the nature to be broken up” ([[SN35.84]]).

6 Parallel: [[SN35.85]] at SN IV 54,1 (which has Ānanda as its protagonists), a

quotation in the _Catuḥśatakaṭīkā_, Lamotte 1944/1976: 2113 note 1, and a

quotation in the _Abhidharmakośavyākhyā_, Wogihara 1932: 181,9. [[SA232]]

world’?”

The Buddha said to Samiddhi: “The eye is empty of being
permanent and of being everlasting, it is empty of being of an
unchanging nature, and it is empty of being ‘mine’. [7] Why is that?


has already been translated and studied by Lamotte 1973: 319–322 (see also

Lamotte 1944/1976: 2112f) and Choong 1999: 89–91 and 2004: 72–74.

7 The Buddha’s statement in [[SN35.85]] at SN IV 54,5 just speaks of the world

being empty of a self and of what belongs to a self. Schmithausen 1987/2007:

479 note 1215 points out that the _Vastusaṃgrahaṇī_, T 1579 at T XXX

812a10, see also Yìnshùn 1983: 277, does define emptiness by mentioning

the absence of a self, making it probable that the lack of such a reference in

[[SA232]] is the result of a textual corruption. The self is also mentioned in the

quotation in the _Catuḥśatakaṭīkā_, Lamotte 1944/1976: 2113 note 1: _ata_

_evoktaṃ bhagavatā: cakṣuḥ samṛddhe śūnyam ātmanā ātmīyena ca nityena_

_dhruveṇa śāśvatenāvipariṇāmadharmmeṇe ti._ The same holds for the

_Abhidharmakośavyākhyā_, Wogihara 1932: 181,9: _cakṣuḥ samṛddhe śūnyaṃ_

_nityena dhruvena śāśvatena avipariṇāmadharmeṇa ātman’ātmīyena ca_ ; see

This is its intrinsic nature. [8] Likewise forms, eye-consciousness,
eye-contact, and feeling arisen in dependence on eye-contact

[and experienced within], be it painful, pleasant, or neutral, that
is also empty of being permanent and of being everlasting, it is
empty of being of an unchanging nature, and it is empty of being
‘mine’. Why is that? This is its intrinsic nature.

“The ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind _is_
_also like that_ . Thus ‘the world’ is called ‘empty’.”

When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the
Buddha had said the monastic Samiddhi was delighted and
received it respectfully. [56c]


also the _Yogācārabhūmi_, Delhey 2009: 184 (§4.1.2.1.1.2) and the

_Abhidharmadīpa & Vibhāṣāpṛabhāvṛtti_, Jaini 1959: 254,3 _._


8
Such a remark is not found in [[SN35.85]] but see the _Abhidharma-_

_kośavyākhyā_, Wogihara 1932: 181,10: _tat kasya hetoḥ? prakṛtir asyaiṣe ti_,

and the _Catuḥśatakaṭīkā_ quote, Lamotte 1944/1976: 2113 note 1: _tat kasya_

_hetoḥ? prakṛtir asyaiṣe ti._ Regarding this phrase in [[SA232]] Lamotte 1973:

321 note 23 and 1944/1976: 2114 note 1 reasons that this could be an

interpolation by a Mahāyānist, given that this expression occurs regularly in

_Prajñāpāramitā_ texts. For reservations regarding another instance where

Lamotte considers a certain description found in the _Ekottarika-āgama_ as

reflecting Mahāyāna influence because the same can be found in

_Prajñāpāramitā_ texts see Anālayo 2013: 6ff.

## 233) [9]

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at
Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.

At that time the Blessed One said to the monastics: “I will now
teach you the world, the arising of the world, the cessation of the
world, and the path to the cessation of the world, listen carefully
and pay proper attention.

“What is the world? That is, it is the six internal sense-spheres.
What are the six? They are the internal sense-sphere of the
eye … the ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … and the
internal sense-sphere of the mind.

“What is the arising of the world? That is, it is craving for future
becoming, which is conjoined with lust and enjoyment,


9 Parallel: Akanuma 1929/1990: 41 mentions [[SN35.107]] at SN IV 87,9; see

also Chung 2008: 76. Yet [[SN35.107]] differs in several respects from [[SA233]]

it does not define ‘the world’ nor does it take up the path to the world’s

cessation, and the definitions given in [[SN35.107]] for the arising and the

cessation of the world are quite different from those in [[SA233]] Thus it

seems better to consider [[SN35.107]] and [[SA233]] as distinct expositions of

the same topic. An extract from [[SA233]] has already been translated by

Choong 2000: 84.


On the Six Sense-spheres (2) — A Translation of _Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 230 to 249  83


 delighting  with attachment here and there. [10]

“What is the cessation of the world? That is, it is the abandoning
without remainder of that craving for future becoming, which is
conjoined with lust and enjoyment,  delighting  with attachment
here and there; its having been given up, its having been vomited
out, its having been eradicated, its fading away, its cessation, its
ending, and its disappearance.

“What is the path to the cessation of the world? That is, it is the
noble eightfold path of right view, right intention, right speech,
right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and
right concentration.”

When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the
Buddha had said the monastics were delighted and received it
respectfully.

277 note 1.

Wille 1989: 120 (see also SHT V 1442, Sander and Waldschmidt 1985:

84 正觀第八十八期/二 Ο 一九年三月二十五日

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at
Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.

At that time the Blessed One said to the monastics: “I do not say
that a person reaches the end of the world by travelling, and I
also do not say that without travelling one reaches the end of the
world and the unsurpassed transcendence of _dukkha_ .” [12] Having
spoken like this, he entered his hut to sit in meditation.

Then, soon after the Blessed One had left, a group of many
monastics together discussed it: “The Blessed One has
proceeded by expounding a teaching in brief, saying: ‘I do not
say that a person reaches the end of the world by travelling, and
I also do not say that without travelling one reaches the end of
the world and gains the unsurpassed transcendence of _dukkha_ .’ [13]
Having spoken like this, he has entered his hut to sit in


12 The corresponding passage in [[SN35.116]] at SN IV 93,5 states that the end

of the world is not reached by travelling, _gamana_ (perhaps a reference to

the _Rohitassa-sutta_, [[AN4.45]] at AN II 47,22), yet making an end of _dukkha_

requires having reached the end of the world. [[SA234]] has 行 (as its

counterpart to _gamana_ ) in both statements; judging from the verses by

Ānanda at the end of [[SA234]] the second occurrence seems to be the result

of a textual error.

13 The corresponding Sanskrit fragment abbreviates this part; see SHT VI

1404+1411 V2, Bechert and Wille 1989: 120: _nā[haṃ] gama[n]e[na_

_lo]kasyāṃtamanuprāptavyaṃ va[d]āmi pūrvavadyāvatpratisaṃla._

meditation.

“Now we do not understand the meaning concerning the
teaching which the Blessed One has expounded in brief. Who
among the venerable ones here has the capability to expound to
us in detail the meaning concerning the teaching which the
Blessed One has expounded in brief?”

They further said: “The only one is the venerable Ānanda, who
is wise and has good memory, who constantly attends on the
Blessed One as his assistant and who is praised by the Blessed
One for being a learned practitioner of the holy life. He has the
ability to expound to us in detail herein the meaning concerning
the teaching which the Blessed One has taught in brief. Let us
now approach the venerable Ānanda and request him so that he
will expound it.”

Then the group of many monastics approached the venerable
Ānanda and, having exchanged polite greetings with each other
and sat to one side, they requested Ānanda _as fully [described]_
_in the above episode in detail_ .


86 正觀第八十八期/二 Ο 一九年三月二十五日

Then Ānanda said to the monastics: [14] “Listen and pay proper
attention to what I will now say. Whatever there is of a ‘world’,
of naming a ‘world’, of experiencing a ‘world’, of designating a
‘world’, of a linguistic expression of a ‘world’, it all enters into
being counted as a ‘world’. [15] Venerable friends, [57a] that is, the
eye is a ‘world’, a naming of a ‘world’, an experiencing of a
‘world’, a designation of a ‘world’, a linguistic expression of a
‘world’; it all enters into being counted as a ‘world’.

“The ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind _is_
_also like that_ .

“A learned noble disciple understands as it really is the arising
of the six sense-spheres, their cessation, their gratification, their


14 In [[SN35.116]] at SN IV 94,24 Ānanda tells the monastics that they should

have asked the Buddha directly, comparing their coming to him instead to

someone who, being in quest of heartwood, takes instead the branches and

leaves of a tree. Similar to the case of [[SA211]] (see Anālayo 2016: 35 note

65), given that the Buddha had withdrawn into his hut, it could hardly be

expected that the monastics ask him for an explanation. This makes the

presentation in [[SA234]] where Ānanda does not censure the monastics for

not having asked the Buddha himself, fit the narrative context more

naturally.

15 [[SN35.116]] at SN IV 95,27 only takes up the two topics of being a perceiver

of the world and a conceiver of the world, _lokasaññin_ and _lokamānin_ .


On the Six Sense-spheres (2) — A Translation of _Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 230 to 249  87


danger, and the escape from them. [16] This is called a noble
disciple who reaches the end of the world, who understands the
world and who, having been burdened by the world, has
transcended the world.”

At that time the venerable Ānanda further spoke in verse:

“It is not by travelling
that one is able to reach the end of the world.

[Yet] without reaching the end of the world
one is unable to escape from the mass of _dukkha_ .

“For this reason, the venerated sage
is called a knower of the world. [17]


16 Ānanda’s explanation in [[SN35.116]] at SN IV 95,29 just mentions the six

sense-spheres and does not cover the need to understand their arising, etc.

The Sanskrit fragment does mention the need to understand the arising, etc.,

of the six sense-spheres; see SHT VI 1404+1411 R3, Bechert and Wille

1989: 120: _yata [ā]ryaśravakaḥ ṣaṇṇāṃ spa[rś]āyatanānāṃ samudayaṃ_

_cā_ ; and R4: _[ca niḥsaraṇaṃ] ca yathā[bh](ūtaṃ) prajānā._


17
[[SN35.116]] has no stanzas and instead continues with the monastics

reporting Ānanda’s explanation to the Buddha, who approves of it. A

counterpart to the present stanza can be found in SHT VI 1404+1411 R5,

Bechert and Wille 1989: 120: _lokāntaṃ duḥkhasyāntakaro bhavet*_

_tasmāṃ [mu]nirlokavettā._

One is able to reach the end of the world,
by having become established in all [aspects] of the holy life.

“The end of the world is only for those who
with right knowledge are able to apprehend the truth.
Who penetrates with awakened wisdom the world,
for this reason, is said to have crossed over to the other shore.

“In this way, venerable friends, I have now analysed and
expounded in detail for you the brief teaching the Blessed One
had proceeded to expound [before] he entered his hut to sit in
meditation.”

When the venerable Ānanda had expounded this teaching,
hearing what he had said the group of many monastics were
delighted and received it respectfully.

## 235) [18]

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at
Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.

At that time the Blessed One said to the monastics: “To be
dwelling alone is [constantly] painful on having a ‘teacher’ and


18 Parallel: [[SN35.150]] at SN IV 136,4.


On the Six Sense-spheres (2) — A Translation of _Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 230 to 249  89


a disciple who ‘dwells close by’. [19] To be dwelling alone is

[constantly] pleasant on having no ‘teacher’ and no disciple who
‘dwells close by’. [20]

“Why is dwelling alone [constantly] painful on having a ‘teacher’
and a disciple who ‘dwells close by’? In dependence on the eye
and forms, evil and unwholesome thoughts arise together with
lust, anger, and delusion. If that monastic engages in these states,

[then] one is reckoned to be having a ‘teacher’. If one dwells on
this side [of what is unwholesome], one is called a disciple who
‘dwells close by’.


19 In [[SN35.150]] at SN IV 136,7 the issue at stake is just dwelling in pain or

pleasure, without a relationship to dwelling alone.

20 The passage is based on a double intender. Bodhi 2000: 1420 note 148

explains that the corresponding phrasing in [[SN35.150]] “is a riddle which

turns upon two puns difficult to replicate in English. A ‘student’ ( _antevāsī_ )

is literally ‘one who dwells within’, and thus (as the text explains below)

one for whom defilements do not dwell within ( _na antovasanti_ ) is said to

be ‘without students’. The word ‘teacher’ ( _ācariya_ ) is here playfully

connected with the verb ‘to assail’ ( _samudācarati_ ); thus one unassailed by

defilements is said to be ‘without a teacher’.” [[SA235]] involves a similar

pun, in that to have a ‘teacher’ and to be a disciples who ‘dwells close by’

represents being under the influence of lust, anger, and delusion in regard

to what is experienced through the eye, etc.

“The ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind _is_
_also like that._

“In this way dwelling alone is constantly painful on having a
‘teacher’ and a disciple who ‘dwells close by’.

“Why is dwelling alone constantly pleasant on having no
‘teacher’ and no disciple who ‘dwells close by’? In dependence
on the eye and forms, evil and unwholesome thoughts arise
together with lust, anger, and delusion. If that monastic does not
engage in these states, [then] one is reckoned to have no
‘teacher’. If one does not dwell in dependence on that [which is
unwholesome], one is called a disciple who does not ‘dwell close
by’.

“[The ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind _is_
_also like that_ ].

“This is called a constantly pleasant dwelling alone on having
no ‘teacher’ and no disciple who ‘dwells close by’.

“If that monastic has no ‘teacher’ and no disciple who ‘dwells
close by’, I say, that one gains the merits of the holy life. [21] Why
is that? In the holy life established by me, a monastic who has

rightly eradicating _dukkha_ and making a complete  end  of
_dukkha_ .” [22] [57b]

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at
Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.

At that time, in the morning, the venerable Sāriputta put on his
robes and took his bowl to enter the town of Sāvatthī to beg for
food. Having begged for food [and partaken of it], he returned
to the monastery, stored away the robe and the bowl and, having
washed his feet, he took his sitting mat and entered a grove for
the daytime’s sitting in meditation. Then, rising from his
meditation, Sāriputta approached the Blessed One, paid respect

23 Parallel: [[MN151]] at MN III 293,27 (which also has a partial parallel in [[EA45.6]] at T II 773b20). [[SA236]] has already been translated by Choong 2004:

with his head at [the Buddha’s] feet, and withdrew to sit to one
side. [24]

Then the Buddha said to Sāriputta: “Where are you coming
from?” [25]

Sāriputta replied: “Blessed One, I am coming from the daytime’s
sitting in meditation in a grove.”

The Buddha said to Sāriputta: “What meditative abiding did you
enter today?”

Sāriputta said to the Buddha: “Blessed One, today in that grove
I entered the meditative abiding of the concentration on
emptiness.”

The Buddha said to Sāriputta: “It is well, it is well, Sāriputta.
Today in your seated meditation you have entered the meditative


24 [[MN151]] at MN III 293,28 sets in with Sāriputta emerging from seclusion

and approaching the Buddha, without reporting that before that he had

gone to beg for alms.

25 In [[MN151]] at MN III 294,1 the Buddha’s inquiry is preceded by a reference

to the purity of Sāriputta’s faculties.

dwelling of elders. [26] If monastics wish to be those who enter the
meditative [dwelling] of elders, they should train in this way:
When entering the town, when walking to beg for alms, when
leaving the town, they should reflect on this: ‘On seeing forms
with the eye, did I now give rise to desire, to affectionate craving,
to thoughts of craving and attachment?’

“[The ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind _is_
_also like that_ ]. [27]

“Sāriputta, when monastics engage in [self-]examination in this
way, if on cognizing forms with the eye there are thoughts with
craving and they are defiled by attachment, in order to abandon
what is evil and unwholesome those monastics should diligently
be willing to make an effort in, and be capable of, training with
collected mindfulness.

man”, _mahāpurisavihāra_ .

27 [[MN151]] at MN III 294,31 also mentions the other sense-doors. This seems

to be required, since while begging for and partaking of alms a monastic

might come across sounds, odours, flavours, and tangibles that could

provoke unwholesome reactions.

“Those monastics are also like that who diligently arouse
superior willingness to make an effort in training with collected
mindfulness.

“Suppose when examining the monastics [know] that, when on
the road, when walking to beg for alms in the village, when
leaving the village, and in between, on cognizing forms with the
eye there are no thoughts with craving and being defiled by
attachment. Those monastics should for this reason rejoice in
their wholesome roots and practice day and night with energy
and collected mindfulness. [28] These are called monastics who,
when walking, standing, sitting, and reclining, purify the begged
food. For this reason, this is called the Discourse on Being
Established in the Purification of the Begged Food.” [29]

When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the


28 [[MN151]] at MN III 295,1 continues at this point with a series of additional

reflections. Judging from the context, this appears to be a case of an

expansion of an originally more concise presentation; see Anālayo 2005:

96f and 2011: 848.

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Vesālī
in the Hall with the Peaked Roof by the side of the Monkey Pond.

Then a householder by the name of Ugga approached the
Buddha, [57c] paid respect with his head at the Buddha’s feet,
withdrew to sit to one side, and said to the Buddha: “Blessed
One, why is it that one monastic attains Nirvāṇa here and now?
Why is it that [another] monastic does not attain Nirvāṇa here
and now?” [31]

The Buddha said to the householder: “If on cognizing forms with
the eye a monastic has thoughts with craving and is defiled by
attachment, then because of having thoughts with craving and
being defiled by attachment one constantly depends on [such]
cognizing. Because of that bondage and because of that clinging,

“The ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … cognizing
mind-objects with the mind _is also like that_ .

“If on cognizing forms with the eye a monastic does not delight
with craving, being defiled by attachment, [then because of] not
delighting with craving and being defiled by attachment, one
does not depend on [such] cognizing, and because of not being
affected by it, not attached to it, and not clinging to it, this [type
of] monastics attain Nirvāṇa here and now.

monastics it would be preferable that they would sleep, rather

teaching on Nirvāṇa to the monastics.

58 T II 59a7: 道意, which in its general use in Chinese translations conveys

the sense of _bodhicitta_ . This is hardly appropriate for the present context,

hence my rendering as “pathways of the mind”.

He said to Māra: “Evil Māra, where are your oxen? What use do
you have of oxen?”

Māra thought: “The recluse Gotama understood that I am Māra.”
He said to the Buddha: “Gotama, the sphere of contact of the eye
is my vehicle, the sphere of contact of the ear … the nose … the
tongue … the body … the mind is my vehicle.”

He asked again: “Gotama, where do you wish to go to?”

The Buddha said to the evil Māra: “Yours is the sphere of
contact of the eye, the sphere of contact of the ear … the nose …
the tongue … the body … the mind. Where there is no sphere of
contact of the eye, no sphere of contact of the ear … the nose …
the tongue … the body … the mind, that is not in your reach. I
have arrived at and reached that.” [59]

At that time the celestial Māra, the Evil One, spoke in verse: [60]


59 In [[SN35.28]] the Buddha does not explicitly affirm that he has reached that,

although the same would be implicit.

60 The verse exchange in [[SN35.28]] only parallels the first stanza by Māra and

the reply to that by the Buddha.


On the Six Sense-spheres (2) — A Translation of _Saṃyukta-āgama_ Discourses 230 to 249  115


“Suppose a self is  spoken  of, [61]
All of that is mine,
All of it belongs entirely to me.
Gotama, where else can you go?”

At that time the Blessed One spoke a verse in reply:

“Suppose a self is spoken of,
That speaking of a self is wrong.
For this reason, Evil One, know
You have fallen into defeat.”

Māra again spoke a verse: [62]

“If you state you know the path
That safely leads to Nirvāṇa
Proceed by yourself alone.
Why bother teaching others?”


61 The translation is based on emending 常 to 言, in keeping with the first line

of the Buddha’s reply, which repeats what Māra said; see also the parallel

[[SN35.28]] at SN I 116,8, where the corresponding lines in the verse by Māra

and the reply by the Buddha share the use of _vadanti_ .

62 The ensuing verse exchange has a parallel in [[SN35.32]] at SN I 123,14 (which

is preceded by a similar verse exchange on the topic of ‘mine’).


116 正觀第八十八期/二 Ο 一九年三月二十五日

The Blessed One again spoke a verse in reply:

“If on being freed from Māra
One is asked for the crossing over to the other shore of
awakening,
One teaches with equipoise
The truth of what is forever without residue.
Then those, cultivating it without negligence,
Are forever freed from Māra and become independent.” [59b]

Māra again spoke in verse:

“There was a stone resembling a piece of meat
and a hungry crow came wishing to eat it,
having a perception of it as tender
and wishing to nourish the vacuity of its hunger.

In the end it did not get that taste,
With broken beak it rose up into the sky.
I am now like the crow
and Gotama is like the manifestation of a stone.”

Without a way in, he left in shame,
Like the crow that rose up into the void to depart.
Harbouring grief within the mind,

That [Māra] disappeared and was no longer seen.

## 247) [63]

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying in
Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak.

At that time the Blessed One said to the monastics: “If recluses
and brahmins become habituated to drawing close to forms with
the eye, then they follow Māra’s domain … _up to …_ they do not
gain freedom from Māra’s bondage. The ear … the nose … the
tongue … the body … the mind … _are also like this._

“If recluses and brahmins do not become habituated to drawing
close to forms with the eye, [then] they do not follow Māra’s
domain … _up to_ … they gain freedom from Māra’s bondage.
The ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind …
_are also like this_ .”

When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the
Buddha had said the monastics were delighted and received it
respectfully.


63 Parallel: for a section of a commentary on the present passage in the

_Paryāyasaṃgrahaṇī_ of the _Yogācārabhūmi_ see Matsuda 1994: 98f (§II.4).

_As for_ “become habituated to drawing close to”, _in the same way_
_for_ “being bound by”, “being attached to”, “relishing”, [64]
“drawing near to”, “getting together with”, “having an
underlying tendency for”, “upholding”, “being bound by
attachment to”, “[making] mine”, “being in quest of”, “wishing
for”, “being naïve about”, “focusing on”, and “not abandoning”

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying in
Kukkuṭa’s Park at Pāṭaliputta. [67]


64 The translation is based on deleting two additional instances of 如是 and

one instances of 若, following Yìnshùn 1983: 296 note 1.

65 The count of terms for which discourses should be recited is not easily

determined in the original; the translation follows the identification of such

terms by Yìnshùn 1983: 296. The _Paryāyasaṃgrahaṇī_ of the

_Yogācārabhūmi_, Matsuda 1994: 98f, lists the following terms: _ālīyante,_

_avalīyante, āsvādayanti, nigamayanti, upayanti, anuśerate, adhitiṣṭha(n)ti,_

_abhini(viśanti), mamāyante, manyaṃte, prārthayante, ghanīkurvanti,_

_rasīkurvanti, pratiniḥsṛjanti_ . A to some extent comparable list of various

terms to expand an original instruction on becoming habituated can be

found after [[SA131]] at T II 41c4, although here related to the five aggregates

instead.

At that time the venerable Ānanda approached the venerable
Mahācunda and, having exchanged friendly greetings, sat to one
side. [68] At that time the venerable Ānanda said to the venerable
Cunda: “I would like to ask a question. Would you have free
time to show me the answer?”

The venerable Cunda said to the venerable Ānanda: “Friend, on
knowing what you are asking, I shall reply accordingly.”

The venerable Ānanda asked the venerable Cunda: “As the
Blessed One, the Tathāgata, the arahant, the fully awakened one,
on having known and having seen it, has taught that form is
made of the four great [elements] and has designated and has
disclosed that this form, [made of] the four great [elements], is
not self. Has the Tathāgata, the arahant, the fully awakened one,
on having known and having seen it, also taught that
consciousness is not self?”

The venerable Cunda said to the venerable Ānanda: “Friend, you
are most learned. I would come from afar to approach the


relation to which Akanuma 1930/1994: 324 identifies 雞林精舍 as

corresponding to Kukkuṭārāma.

venerable one for the sake of asking for this teaching. Venerable,
may you now explain its meaning.”

The venerable Ānanda said to Cunda: “Venerable, I will now ask
you, show me the answer according to your understanding.
Venerable Cunda, do the eye, forms, and eye consciousness
exist?” [59c]

[Cunda] replied: “They exist.”

The venerable Ānanda asked him again: “Does eyeconsciousness arise in dependence on the eye and forms?”

[Cunda] replied: “It is like this.”

The venerable Ānanda asked him again: “With eyeconsciousness arisen in dependence on the eye and forms, [69] are
those causes, those conditions, permanent or are they
impermanent?”

[Cunda] replied: “They are impermanent.”

The venerable Ānanda asked him again: “As for those causes,
those conditions for the arising of eye-consciousness, when

those causes, those conditions are impermanent and change,
does that [eye-]consciousness remain?” [70]

[Cunda] replied: “No, venerable Ānanda.”

The venerable Ānanda asked him again: “What do you think,
that which can be known to have the nature of arising and of
ceasing, would a learned noble disciple herein regard it as the
self, as distinct from the self [in the sense of being owned by it],
as existing [within the self, or the self] as existing [within it]?”

[Cunda] replied: “No, venerable Ānanda.”

[ _In the same way_ for] the ear … the nose … the tongue … the
body … the mind and mind objects.

[Ānanda asked him again]: “What do you think, do the mind,
mind-objects, and mind-consciousness exist?”

[Cunda] replied: “They exist.”


70 The argument in [[SN35.193]] does not bring in impermanence. Instead, the

point is simply that with the complete cessation of the causes, the

corresponding type of consciousness is not discerned.

[Ānanda] asked him again: “Does mind-consciousness arise in
dependence on the mind and mind-objects?”

[Cunda] replied: “It is like this, venerable Ānanda.”

in dependence on the mind and mind-objects, are those causes,
those conditions, permanent or are they impermanent?”

[Cunda] replied: “They are impermanent, venerable Ānanda.”

[Ānanda] asked him again: “As for those causes, as for those
conditions for the arising of mind-consciousness, when those
causes, those conditions are impermanent and change, does that
mind-consciousness remain?”

[Cunda] replied: “No, venerable Ānanda.”

[Ānanda] asked him again: “What do you think, that which can
be known to have the nature of arising and of ceasing, would a
learned noble disciple herein regard it as the self, as distinct from
the self [in the sense of being owned by it], as existing [within
the self, or the self] as existing [within it]?”

[Cunda] replied: “No, venerable Ānanda.”

The venerable Ānanda said to Cunda: “Venerable, for this
reason the Tathāgata, the arahant, the fully awakened one, on
having known and having seen it, has taught that consciousness
is also  not self  . [71]

“It is just as if a person were to enter a mountain, carrying an
axe. On seeing a plantain tree, thinking that it could be used as
timber, he chops it down at the root and cuts off the leaves. He
takes off the skin in search of solid heart[wood], taking it off
until it is used up, [yet] it is totally without a solid essence.

“In the same way learned noble disciples rightly contemplate
eye-consciousness … ear- … nose- … tongue- … body- …
mind-consciousness. When rightly contemplating it, there will
be nothing at all for them to be grasped. Because there is nothing
to be grasped, they are not attached. Because of not being
attached, they themselves realize Nirvāṇa: ‘Birth for me has
been eradicated, the holy life has been established, what had to
be done has been done, we know ourselves that there will be no
receiving of further existence.”

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at
Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.

At that time the venerable Ānanda approached the venerable
Sāriputta. He said to the venerable Sāriputta: [74] “I would like to
ask a question. Would you have free time to explain it to me?”

[60a]

Sāriputta said: “Friend, on knowing what you are asking, I shall
reply accordingly.”

The venerable Ānanda asked the venerable Sāriputta: “When the
six spheres of contact have been eradicated, faded away, ceased,
appeased, and disappeared, is there something that still remains?”

The venerable Sāriputta said to Ānanda: “You should not ask

Ānanda asked the venerable Sāriputta again: “When the six
spheres of contact have been eradicated, faded away, ceased,

The venerable Sāriputta said to Ānanda: “It is also not proper to
ask in this way: ‘When the six spheres of contact have been
eradicated, faded away, ceased, appeased, and disappeared, is
there nothing that still remains?”

Ānanda asked the venerable Sāriputta again: “When the six
spheres of contact have been eradicated, faded away, ceased,

nothing that remains, or neither something that remains nor
nothing that remains?”

The venerable Sāriputta said to Ānanda: “It is also not proper to

there something that remains and nothing that remains, or

not proper to speak of existence, it is also not proper to speak of
non-existence, it is also not proper to speak of existence and nonexistence, and it is also not proper to speak of neither existence
nor non-existence. What is the meaning of this statement?”

The venerable Sāriputta said to the venerable Ānanda: “This is
indeed baseless talk: [75] ‘When the six spheres of contact have
been eradicated, faded away, ceased, appeased, and disappeared,
is there something that remains?’ This is indeed baseless talk:
‘Is there nothing that remains?’ This is indeed baseless talk: ‘Is
there something that remains and nothing that remains?’ This is
indeed baseless talk: ‘Is there neither something that remains nor
nothing that remains?’ If one says: ‘When the six spheres of
contact have been eradicated, faded away, ceased, appeased, and
disappeared, one attains Nirvāṇa and is apart from all that is
baseless and false, then this is indeed what the Buddha taught.”

to the range of proliferation and with their cessation, proliferation ceases

## Chapter 10 Brāhma�a-vagga

[[MN91]] Brahmāyu-sutta

The Brahmāyu-sutta, the “discourse to Brahmāyu”, describes how the Brahmin Brahmāyu became a disciple of the Buddha. This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyamaāgama and another parallel in an individual translation. [1] A few lines of this discourse
have also been preserved in Sanskrit fragments. [2]
The Brahmāyu-sutta and its two Chinese parallels report in similar terms that the Brahmin Brahmāyu sent his student Uttara to find out if the Buddha was endowed with the
thirty-two marks of a superior being (mahāpurisalakkha�a). [3] On coming into the Buddha’s presence, Uttara was able to verify thirty marks on his own. The Buddha then per

1 The parallels are [[MA161]] at T I 685a-690a and T 76 at T I 883b-886a. [[MA161]] and T 76 agree with [[MN91]] on the location and on taking the name of the Brahmin Brahmāyu as their title ( or ).
According to the information given in the Taishō edition, T 76 was translated by Zhī Qīan ( ). [[MA161]] has been studied and translated by Minh Chau 1964/1991: 72, 166-172, 185-186, and 306-312. Brahmāyu is also mentioned in a list of eminent Brahmins under the heading of �a� ānuśravikā� in the Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1977: 39,4.
2 SHT V 1148 (pp. 146-147), SHT X 3269 (p. 20), SHT X 3425 (p. 73), SHT X 3962 (p. 232, identified in
SHT XI), SHT X 4094 (p. 264), and the so far unpublished SHT XI 4587 and SHT XI 4617d, the former
identified by Gudrun Melzer and the latter by Klaus Wille (I am indebted to Klaus Wille for kindly providing me with draft transliterations of these fragments). SHT X 3269 corresponds to the beginning of
the discourse at MN II 133; SHT V 1148, SHT X 4094, and SHT XI 4587 parallel Uttara’s examination
of the Buddha’s thirty-two marks and his return to Brahmāyu, described at MN II 135; SHT X 3425 has 梵摩經 梵摩渝經
parts of the report how Brahmāyu approached the Buddha, investigated the thirty-two marks, and 支謙 reflected
what to ask the Buddha at MN II 142-143. Fragments that have preserved sections of listings of the thirtytwo marks can also be found in SHT V 1045a (p. 27), SHT VI 1453 (p. 141), and SHT IX 2895 (p. 301).
3 While [[MN91]] at MN II 134,2 and [[MA161]] at T I 685a11 agree on the name Uttara/, T 76 at T I
883b23 gives his name as, apparently taking mā�ava, “Brahmin youth”, to be his proper name. A
difference in regard to the qualities of Uttara is that whereas according to [[MN91]] at MN II 134,2 he had
mastered the three Vedas, ti��a� vedāna� pāragu, according to [[MA161]] at T I 685a13 he had mastered
four Vedas, . [[MN91]] at MN II 133,13 mentions the three Vedas also in relation to Brahmāyu (the
parallel passage in [[MA161]] does not refer to Brahmāyu’s knowledge of the Vedas). Minh Chau 1964/1991:
307 comments that the reference to four Vedas in the description of Uttara in [[MA161]] is a sign of later
development. An otherwise unrelated discourse in the Sa�yukta-āgama, [[SA255]] at T II 63c12, still speaks
just of three Vedas, . Influence of the later notion of four Vedas can also be found in the Pāli commentary at Ps III 362,15, according to which the subsequent reference in [[MN91]] at MN II 133,15 to “stories as fifth”, itihāsapañcamāna� (found also in [[MA161]] at T I 685a14 as ), implies that in the 優多羅
preceding part four Vedas are 摩納 intended, athabba��aveda� catuttha� katvā ... itihāso pañcamo. A description of a learned Brahmin in the Jain Viyāhapa��atti 2.18 in Lalwani 1973b: 152,18 does indeed list the
four Vedas followed by itihāsapa�camā�a�.Yet, as Bodhi in Ñā�amoli 1995/2005: 1297 note 850 points
out, “it is more 四典經 likely ... that the histories are called ‘the fifth’ in connection with the four branches of study
auxiliary to the Vedas that precede them in the description”, i.e., as the fifth of the listing in [[MN91]] at MN
II 133,15: nigha��u, ke�ubha, akkhara and pabheda (a fourfold listing that has its counterpart in [[MA161]]
at T I 685a13 in ); cf. also Rhys Davids 1899: 109 note 2 and Winternitz 1908: 110.

formed a feat of supernormal power so that Uttara was able to verify the remaining two
marks. [4] Uttara followed the Buddha for some time to observe the Buddha’s conduct
and then returned to his teacher in order to give a detailed account of the Buddha’s thirtytwo marks and of various aspects of the Buddha’s conduct. [5]

MN II 136  The Brahmāyu-sutta and its two Chinese parallels list the thirty-two marks of the Buddha by proceeding from feet to head. Treatments of the same topic found in the Lalitavistara and the Mahāvyutpatti differ, as their descriptions of these marks proceed rather
from head to feet. [6]
Before embarking on a survey of these thirty-two marks in the Brahmāyu-sutta and
its parallels, it may be worthwhile to note that the Brahmāyu-sutta and other discourses
consider the ability to recognize these marks of a superior being as an art to be learned.
Such ability is in fact part of the standard description of the qualities of a praiseworthy
Brahmin in the Pāli discourses. [7]
Now, if to recognize these thirty-two marks is a praiseworthy quality and requires previous training, it would follow that, at least in the way these marks were conceived at
the time of the early discourses, they should not have been easily visible physical marks.
In other words, the original conception of these marks would probably have intended
nuances, perceptible only to a keen observer who was trained in the art of detecting
them, not abnormal physical marks that are so plainly evident that one cannot fail to
notice them.

4 T 76 at T I 883c8 further enhances this feat of supernormal power by describing that five coloured lights
appeared and circled thrice around the Buddha’s body, a phenomena that recurs again in T 76 at T I
884b21 in a description of how the Buddha would answer questions posed by his disciples.
5 The versions differ on the time period during which Uttara followed the Buddha, which according to the
Sanskrit fragment SHT V 1148R2 was three months, according to [[MA161]] at T I 686a13 four months,
according to T 76 at T I 883c14 six months, and according to [[MN91]] at MN II 135,23 seven months. Another difference is that in the Sanskrit fragment and the two Chinese versions Uttara took his leave and
paid his respect to the Buddha before departing, a circumstance not mentioned in [[MN91]]
6 Hokazono 1994: 484,14 or Lefmann 1902: 105,11 or Vaidya 1958b: 74,22, and Mahāvyutpatti no. 236267 in Sakaki 1926: 22-24, a difference in order already noted by Waddell 1914/1915: 138. Bollée 2005:
23 explains that in the order of listing found, e.g., in [[MN91]] and its parallels, “the feet are dealt with first,

[since] gods as well as great men like kings [are] being looked up to from below, for the viewer is lying
at his [or their] feet”. Waldschmidt 1930: 271 and Weber 1994: 43 hold the sequence in [[MN91]] and its
parallels to be the more original version; cf. also the survey in Burnouf 1852/1925: 577. For references to
other occurrences of this order cf. Dietz 2006: 153. For references to these thirty-two marks in general cf.
BHSD: 458-460; for a listing of these marks in an Uighur fragment cf. von Gabain 1954: 52-53; on the practice of visualizing the thirty-two marks, as described in T 643, cf. Yamabe 1999b: 216-262. For a comparison of the marks in the Lalitavistara with similar marks in Purā�a texts cf. Sastri 1940: 311-314; for
a survey of comparable marks associated with Mahāvīra cf. Shah 1987: 95-96.
7 [[MN91]] at MN II 133,16 and MN II 134,2 includes mahāpurisalakkha�esu anavayo in a list of praiseworthy qualities of Brahmāyu and of his student Uttara. The same knowledge is, according to [[DN4]] at DN I
120,17, part of the prerequisites that make up a true Brahmin in the eyes of other Brahmins, according to
[[AN3.59]] at AN I 166,20, this knowledge is required to be reckoned a tevijjā Brahmin by other Brahmins,
and according to [[AN5.192]] at AN III 223,18, such knowledge makes a Brahmin worthy of respect by other
Brahmins.


Chapter 10 Brāhma�a-vagga                                   -  529


Another point to be noted is that the discourses present the science of these thirty-two
marks as a Brahminical lore, considering such concern with physical marks as an occupation peculiar to Brahmins. [8] According to the Mahāvastu, when the bodhisattva was
about to be born, the devas of the Pure Abodes taught the thirty-two marks to the Brahmins in order to enable them to recognize the bodhisattva, a suggestion made also in
the Pāli commentary. [9] This presents the thirty-two marks as a tool to help ancient Indian
Brahmins appreciate the spiritual potential of the bodhisattva.
In the discourses, the thirty-two marks fulfil the same purpose in regard to the spiritual accomplishment of the Buddha, as by verifying their existence Brahmins develop
the necessary faith to give ear to the Buddha’s liberating teachings. Several discourses
describe how prominent Brahmins are told by their fellow Brahmins that it is beneath
their dignity to visit a wandering ascetic like the Buddha. In reply, Brahmins like Sonada��a, Kū�adanta, and Ca�kī highlight the qualities of the Buddha, among others his
possession of the thirty-two marks of a superior being, thereby lending support to their
conviction that it is proper for them to visit someone who is endowed with such excellent qualities. [10] Thus, from the perspective of these discourses, the thirty-two marks of
a superior being function as a tool by means of which Brahmins can be convinced to
have respect for the Buddha, so that they become willing to approach him.
According to the description of these thirty-two marks in the Brahmāyu-sutta and its
parallels, a thousand-spoked wheel was found on the sole of each of the Buddha’s feet. [11]


8 Those who wish to examine whether the Buddha has these marks are usually Brahmins attempting to ascertain the spiritual accomplishment of the Buddha, such as the Brahmin Amba��ha in [[DN3]] at DN I
105,22, the Brahmin Pokkharasāti (Amba��ha’s teacher) in [[DN3]] at DN I 109,1, or the Brahmin Sela in
[[MN92]] at MN II 146 (= [[SNP3.7]] at Sn p. 107,11). Coomaraswamy 1928a: 816 remarks that these “conceptions of ideal form, expressed in terms of physiognomy ... are not so much of Buddhist as of Brāhmanical (and ultimately of popular) origin”. In fact, [[DN1]] at DN I 9,4 reckons the art of making predictions based on the physical marks (lakkha�a) of a person to be an “animal knowledge”, tiracchānavijjā,
and a wrong type of livelihood. Sv I 92,24 explains this passage to refer to predicting that someone with
certain marks will become king, etc.: lakkha�an ti iminā lakkha�ena samannāgato rājā hoti.
9 Basak 1963a: 238,2 and 480,13 or Senart 1882a: 197,8 and 366,10, as well as Ps III 364,12.
10 Sonada��a in [[DN4]] at DN I 116,8, Kū�adanta in [[DN7]] at DN I 132,18, and Ca�kī in [[MN95]] at MN II
167,19.
11 Minh Chau 1964/1991: 168 suggests that the preceding quality, according to which the Buddha sets his
feet squarely on the ground, is not found in the Madhyama-āgama version. The description of the thirtytwo marks in [[MA161]] at T I 686a25-c15 joins several marks into one, so that its actual listing covers only
twenty-eight points, a circumstance which can easily lead to overlooking a quality when comparing the
list in [[MA161]] with its counterparts in [[MN91]] or T 76. This may be why Minh Chau apparently did not
notice the first quality in [[MA161]] at T I 686a25:, which corresponds to the first quality in [[MN91]] at MN II 136,6: suppati��hitapādo and in T 76 at T I 883c23:, all of which describe the
level tread of the Buddha’s feet; on which cf. also Weller 1923: 174 note 27. Strong 2001: 41 explains
the significance of this characteristic to be that “just as a cakravatin ... will encounter no obstacles or
opposition as he conquers the world, so too a buddha will find none who can oppose him as he spreads
the Dharma”. Regarding another and presumably in some way related quality of the feet, ussa�khapāda,
judging from Bollée 1977a: 375 the arches of the feet might represent having stepped on and thereby
mastered evil.

530   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


A description of the feet of a Buddha in the Mahāvastu of the Mahāsā�ghika-Lokottaravāda Vinaya indicates that his soles were also decorated with swastikas. [12]
At a later point of its treatment, the individual translation reports that the wheel-mark
produced by the Buddha’s footprints would continue to shine for seven days and become
the object of people’s worship. [13] A discourse in the A�guttara-nikāya and its Chinese
and Gāndhārī parallels describe the effect the Buddha’s footprints once had on a Brahmin. [14] This Brahmin had seen the imprint of the wheel-mark in the Buddha’s footprints
and was awe-struck, wondering what kind of a divine being could have such footprints.
This motivated him to follow the footsteps until he came to the Buddha’s presence,
who then delivered a discourse to this Brahmin on the nature of a Buddha.
Another tale related to the wheel-mark on the Buddha’s feet can be found in the Sa�ghabhedavastu of the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya. According to this tale, when Ajātasattu had usurped the throne, Devadatta approached him and requested to be recognized
as the successor to the Buddha. Ajātasattu replied that this was not possible, as Devadatta did not have wheel-marks on the soles of his feet. This caused Devadatta to approach a smith and have wheel-marks burnt on his feet. [15]
The wheel-mark on the Buddha’s feet also played a central role in early Buddhist
iconography, which initially did not depict the Buddha in human form, [16] but symbolically indicated his presence by various means, one of these being footprints marked
with a wheel.
When describing the length and softness of the Buddha’s hand and feet, the Pāli version notes that his fingers and toes were “netted”. [17] The commentary on this characteristic draws attention to a Vinaya regulation, according to which someone whose fingers
and toes are webbed together by skin should not be ordained. [18] The commentary then
concludes that the reference to the Buddha’s “netted” fingers and toes should not be

Buddha’s feet and their representations cf., e.g., Cicuzza 2011, Quagliotti 1998, Skilling 1992b, and id.

13 T 76 at T I 884a19, which actually reads, where the could be a scribal error for, or else the
idea could be that the wheel-imprints appeared without the Buddha’s feet even touching the ground (an
idea found, e.g., in T 807 at T XVII 751c6, cf. Harrison 1995: 4).
14 [[AN4.36]] at AN II 37,26, [[SA101]] at T II 28a23, [[SA2]] 267 at T II 467a29, and the British Library Kharo��hī
fragment 12 line 4 in Allon 2001: 120. Another parallel, [[EA38.3]] at T II 717c21, does not mention the
wheel sign, as it only reports that the Brahmin saw that the Buddha’s footprints were “excellent”, .
Wimalaratana 1994: 138 notes that the wheel symbol as a mark of divine power is also found “on the
hand of Visnu figures”; cf. also Horsch 1957: 73. Neumann 1896/1995: 1114 note 242 interprets the
thousand-spoke wheel to refer to the imprint left by the heel on dusty or wet ground; for a similar suggestion cf. Senart 1882b: 90.

taken literally, but should be understood to imply that his feet and hands were marked
with lines. [19] In fact, even though the Buddha was never formally ordained, it would be
curious to represent him with a physical peculiarity that would bar a prospective monk
from ordination.
The Madhyama-āgama version follows a more literal interpretation of this quality, as
it compares the Buddha’s netted fingers and toes to a goose. [20] This image suggests that
the Buddha’s fingers and toes were connected to each other through skin. The same idea
recurs also in the Divyāvadāna, the Lalitavistara, and the Mahāvastu, which describe
that the fingers and toes were “connected” by a net. [21] Several scholars have suggested
that such an interpretation could have arisen from a misunderstanding of a feature found
on Buddha statues, as sculpture makers tend to weld fingers and toes together so that
they do not break off. [22]


19 Ps III 376,17. Wimalaratana 1994: 89 explains that, since according to another characteristic the fingers
are of equal length, “the lines running across the fingers must be parallel”, concluding that “the clear cut
parallel lines running on the palms and toes would have shown as if the fingers were connected to each
other”. Instead of lines on the surface of the palm, according to Coomaraswamy 1931: 21 the jāla could
represent “a perfection of form demonstrated by the appearance of the reddish lines of light that may be
seen between the parallel fingers when the hand is held up to the light ... such lines are only ... seen when
the fingers are regular (ekappamā�ā) as well as delicate and long (which other lakkha�as require), if the
joints are swollen, there will be places where the fingers are too closely pressed together to allow ... the
passage of any light at all, and other spaces where the fingers are not quite in contact, and only clear daylight can be seen between the fingers. Hence the jālalakkha�a implies after all nothing but a perfection
of form of the fingers”. For critical remarks on this interpretation cf. Banerjea 1931b. Senart 1882b: 146
interprets this sign as originally referring to a form of luminescence of the hand and feet.

imagery in relation to the Buddha cf. also the Divyāvadāna in Cowell 1886: 148,12 or in Vaidya 1999:
91,31. Regnier 1997: 576 notes that in ancient Indian literature the ha�sa stands for nobility, making it
only natural that characteristics of this animal are attributed to a venerated person; cf. also the detailed
study by Vogel 1962. According to the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-(upadeśa-)śāstra, T 1509 at T XXV
90b9, this characteristic is only visible when the fingers are stretched apart,,
translated by Lamotte 1944/1981: 273: “quand il écarte les doigts, la membrane apparaît; quand il
n’écarte pas les doigts elle n’appara 沙門瞿曇手足網縵, ît pas”. This explanation suggests the possibility that perhaps this 猶如鴈王
characteristic refers only to the connecting skin found at the base of the fingers, as suggested by Neumann 1896/1995: 1146 note 478. In the case of the Buddha, this skin may have been held to have differed from that of average human beings, perhaps being more prominent, so as to warrant mention as a
special characteristic.

22 Banerjea 1930: 725 examines this feature in the light of early Indian sculptures and concludes that the 張指則現, 不張則不現
idea that the Buddha had a sort of skin between his fingers and toes is due to being misled by “a simple
craftsman’s device”, cf. also Foucher 1918: 308 and Lamotte 1946: 66. Van Lohuizen-de Leeuw 1995:
214 notes that the same characteristic can already be found in painted Buddha images from the 2 [nd] cen

532   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


The Brahmāyu-sutta describes the concealed nature of the Buddha’s male organ, a
quality the Madhyama-āgama version illustrates with the example of a horse. [23] This is
one of the two qualities the Buddha had to reveal to Uttara, as it would not have been
possible for Uttara to ascertain this characteristic on his own.
The Brahmāyu-sutta and its two Chinese parallels concur that the Buddha’s skin had
a hue resembling gold, [24] and was of such nature that dirt would not adhere to it. [25] The


tury A.D. As in the case of paintings the fingers would not need any support to prevent breaking off, this
indicates that by that time the Buddha was indeed thought to have had some type of skin or web between
his fingers. Stutterheim 1929: 235 adduces a passage from Kālidāsa in support of the hypothesis that the
jāla characteristic refers to reddish lines of light seen between parallel fingers of the hand held against
the sun (cf. also Coomaraswamy quoted above in note 19), and suggests that the connection between the
fingers to be seen on sculptures and painted images could be an attempt to represent the effect created
by these reddish lines of light.

occurrence of the same mark in [[DN14]] at DN II 17,28 (Hirakawa 1997: 1282 gives kośagatavastiguyhatā for ), to which [[MA161]] at T I 686b16 adds “like an excellent horse king”, . The
image of a horse king recurs also in [[MA59]] at T I 494a5 (parallel to kosohitavatthaguyho in [[DN30]] at
DN III 143,23). The Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1977: 50,15 compares this characteristic to a well-bred
horse and also to a well-bred elephant. Barnes 1987: 120 explains that “a common Buddhist interpretation of the sheathed penis of the Buddha ... is ... that his penis is covered because he has abandoned sexuality completely”. Dayal 1932/1970: 305 similarly comments that “the covered male organ typifies lifelong chastity”; cf. also Verardi 1999/2000: 71, who suggests that this mark “indicates the sexually indistinct nature of any divine being, who, as such, embodies both the male and the female principles”, comparable to the retracted penis of a horse or an elephant, whereby 陰馬藏 “outwardly, its sexual characteristics
remain indistinct”. That something of this type must be intended is also highlighted by Egge 2003: 205
note 18, who points out that 馬藏相 “the phrase kosohita�vatthaguyha� is usually rendered as ‘the genitals (lit. 猶良馬王
‘that which is to be hidden by a cloth’) are enclosed in a sheath’. However, because kosa can mean foreskin, this mark thus understood is hardly distinctive”. That is, perhaps the point of this mark is that the
Buddha was able to retract his male organs, similar to horses and elephants; cf. also Anālayo 2010c.
Another aspect associated by some scholars with this mark is that “the idea of a woman’s incapability to
become a Buddha must have been derived from this tenth mark possessed by the Buddha, because even
if the genitals are concealed, this mark necessitates that a Buddha must be a man”, cf. Kajiyama 1982:
65 (quoting Ōchō to this effect); cf. also Hae-ju 1999: 131 and Romberg 2002: 164. For a reply to this
suggestion cf. Anālayo 2009b: 181-182 note 54.

143,25 further qualifies suva��ava��a as kañcanasannibha, “resembling gold”, thereby making it clear
that resemblance is intended with this characteristic (cf. also Dietz 2006: 155, restoration of fragment
1r4, and [[SNP3.7]] at [[SNP551]]). Horner 1957/1970: 321 note 5 explains that golden is “the traditional colour
symbol for immortality”, Huxley 1996: 156 comments that “when the Buddha’s skin shines forth brighter
than gold [D. II. 133], this recalls the iconography of Indian gods”; cf. also Franke 1914b: 350 and Nakamura 2000b: 221. Powers 2009: 136 notes that “a golden exterior is a pervasive motif in Indian Buddhist literature that indicates moral excellence”. [[DN30]] at DN III 159,7 reckons the golden colour of the
Buddha’s skin to be the karmic fruit of past lives spent free from anger. The Mahāvastu in Basak 1965:
32,6 or in Senart 1890: 23,7 notes that already at his birth the body of the bodhisattva was of such golden
colour, sugata� vigraha� 身黃金色 iva jātarūpasya. The Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1978a: 身色紫金 163,24 takes this qual

commentary concludes that he Buddha had no need to wash himself at all. This stands
to some extent in contrast to the Brahmāyu-sutta and its Chinese parallels, which record that the Buddha washed his feet, [26] and which also describe that after a meal the
Buddha would clean his bowl in such a way that at the same time his hands were being
washed. [27] From the commentarial perspective, however, a Buddha has no need to wash
his hands and feet, although he may do so in order to refresh himself or set an example
to others. [28]
The Madhyama-āgama discourse explains that dust did not stick to the Buddha’s
skin due to his former wholesome conduct. [29] According to the Lakkha�a-sutta, this
particular quality was the result of the Buddha’s practice, during former lives, of approaching ascetics and Brahmins for instructions. [30] The connection the Lakkha�a-sutta
makes between receiving instructions from an ascetic or Brahmin and being free from
dust brings to mind the standard descriptions of the attainment of stream-entry during a
gradual discourse given by the Buddha, which refer to the stream-entrant’s vision of
truth in terms of the arising of the “dustless and stainless” Dharma-eye, [31] although in
this context the absence of dust is obviously meant symbolically.
According to the Brahmāyu-sutta and its parallels, when the Buddha stood erect he
could rub and stroke his knees with the palms of his hands. [32] This characteristic would


ity literally, as it describes that Devadatta had his body gilded by a goldsmith in order to imitate the
golden colour of the Buddha’s body; cf. also T 1450 at T XXIV 191c2 and Matsunami 1979: 335. The
Theravāda Vinaya also seems to follow a literal interpretation, as it refers to the colour of the Buddha’s
skin in order to define “gold”, Vin III 238,2: jātarūpa� nāma satthuva��o vuccati.

require disproportionally long arms and does not seem to be compatible with another
of the thirty-two marks, according to which the height of the Buddha’s body equals the
span of his arms. [33]
The Brahmāyu-sutta and its parallels agree that the Buddha had a superior sense of
taste. [34] To include the Buddha’s sense of taste in a listing of physical characteristics is
puzzling, since it is not easy to imagine how visitors like Uttara were able to verify this
quality. [35]
The Pāli and Chinese versions portray the Buddha with a long tongue and with forty
white teeth, [36] which would imply that the Buddha had eight teeth more than the usual
number of teeth in human dentition. [37] They also compare his jaw to that of a lion. [38]

Brahminical literature ... long arms signify heroism ... and leadership”.

as “having the nerves of sensation meeting at the top”; cf. also Wimalaratana 1994: 113, who suggests
that this characteristic might refer to the “sensory taste receptors” found in the mouth. The topic of the
Buddha’s taste comes up again in [[MN91]] at MN I I 138,26, which notes that the Buddha would taste
food without experiencing desire for the taste of food, rasapa�isa�vedi ... āhāra� āhāreti, no ca rasarāgapa�isa�vedi; cf. also [[MA161]] at T I 687b5 and T 76 at T I 884b1. The same topic recurs in the Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1978a: 37,27 as a statement made by the Buddha when, on the occasion of his
first visit home after awakening, his former wife attempted to lure him with tasty food, aha� ... rasapratisa�vedī no tu rasarāgapratisa�vedī.
35 Bodhi in Ñā�amoli 1995/2005: 1298 note 856 comments that “it is difficult ... to understand either how 通味第一
this 味 quality could be considered 味味次第味 a physical characteristic or how it could be perceived by others”. Boucher
2008: 176 note 12 similarly points out that “one might wonder why no doubt seems to have been expressed
concerning the Buddha’s exquisite sense of taste”. Lopez 2005: 20 sums up that the texts do not indicate
how someone could have seen “the perfect sense of taste, the forty teeth, and only one body hair per follicle”.
36 [[MN91]] at MN II 137,1, [[MA161]] at T I 686c3, and T 76 at T I 884a3.
37 Myer 1986: 129 includes this characteristic among “physical peculiarities or even abnormalities that may
well have been considered auspicious”. Wimalaratana 1994: 115 explains that “in ancient India the possession of more than the common number of teeth was regarded as an auspicious characteristic”, following “a common trend of Indian thought to increase qualities or characteristics numerically to denote
the superiority of a person”. According to an explanation proposed by Neumann 1896/1995: 1115 note
248, the reference to forty teeth might only represent the beginning fourth decade and thus should be
taken to mean “over thirty” teeth. Such an interpretation would be in line with an observation made by
Nitta 2008: 1099 regarding the thirty-two characteristics in general, in that some of these marks “seem
very unnatural, leading us to wonder ... whether ancient Buddhists ... believed in them literally”. Yet, in
the present case a more literal understanding cannot be a priori excluded, as supernumerary teeth do on
occasion occur, which could involve fourth and fifth molars, so that a set of forty teeth is not entirely
impossible. In fact, had the Buddha been held to have the normal number of teeth (just “over thirty”), it
would be difficult to understand how this could have been considered a distinct mark of a superior being.

This brings to mind a recurrent image in the discourses, which compares the Buddha’s
proclamation of his teachings to a lion sounding its roar. [39]
According to the Pāli version’s description, the Buddha’s head was like a turban. [40]
The commentary explains this to refer to the roundness of the Buddha’s head. [41] The
Chinese versions, however, render the same quality in a way that appears to have a real
protuberance in mind. [42]
This could be another misunderstanding caused by a feature found on Buddha images.
In ancient Indian art, it was apparently a standard procedure to represent gods and divine beings with long hair, at times depicted as being worn in a topknot. [43] Although the
discourses leave little doubt that the Buddha was shaven-headed just like other monks, [44]


39 Cf. above pp. 99 and 105; for a study of the motif of the lion’s roar cf. Anālayo 2009g.
40 [[MN91]] at MN II 137,9: “turban [like] head”, u�hīsasīso (Se-MN II 533,17: u�hisasīso), a mark the Lakkha�a-sutta, [[DN30]] at DN III 169,3, presents as the outcome of past lives spent in wholesome conduct,
generosity, and respectful behaviour. The wearing of a turban was one of the royal insignia of a headanointed king, cf., e.g., [[MN89]] at MN II 119,27, which depicts how king Pasenadi took off his turban,
u�hīsa, as a mark of respect when approaching the Buddha.
41 Ps III 386,4: “according to one method of explanation, ‘turban [like] head’ [means] that his head is like
a ‘head wrapped with a turban’, according to a second method of explanation, ‘turban [like] head’ [means]
that his ‘head is all round like a turban’”, purimanayena u�hīsave�hitasīso viyā ti u�hīsasīso, dutiyanayena u�hīsa� viya sabbattha parima��alasīso ti u�hīsasīso.
42 [[MA161]] at T I 686c13 and T 76 at T I 884a9:, literally “flesh [like] a topknot”.
43 Banerjea 1931a: 510 and 512 explains that “wearing of long hair in different modes was a common custom among the males ... They not only carried these luxurious locks on their own heads in different shapes,
but endowed their gods with this same characteristic. Thus the various gods depicted in the early Indian
monuments of the pre-Christian period ... are shown with luxuriant hair dressed in various ways”, with
the hair worn in a topknot as “one of their most prominent adornments”. When with the passage of time
the Buddha was seen more and more as a divine being, “in the anthropomorphic representation of the
Bhagavat, the depiction of the flowing tresses was quite natural”. After surveying representations of the
u�hīsa in ancient Indian art, Banerjea concludes that the early representations were merely meant to
show a topknot, but these representations were later misunderstood to represent a fleshy or even bony
protuberance. Coomaraswamy 1928a: 835, who comes to the same conclusion, notes that 肉髻 “we have no
literary or iconographic evidence for the interpretation of the u�nī�a as a bony protuberance previous to
about A.[[DN100]] at the earliest”. Kramrisch 1935: 157 explains that “the manifested power of divinity is
shown in the growth of hair”, which she relates not only to the sculptural representation of the Buddha
with long hair, but also sees behind the traditional account of the bodhisattva’s first aspiration to become
a Buddha, suggesting that “when the future Śākyamuni spreads his hair before Dīpa�kara Buddha to walk
over it, the power of the previous Buddha is transmitted to the Buddha to be”. Van Lohuizen-de Leeuw
1995: 164 notes that “not only the Buddha but also gods show the u��ī�a ... there is no doubt that it was
intended to reproduce a hair-knot on top of the head ... not until much later was it understood as a protuberance of the skull”; cf. also Foucher 1918: 297, who relates the arising of the idea of a protuberance
to a change in the way the hair was being represented. Waldschmidt 1930: 274 suggests that perhaps
awareness of the fact that the Buddha had been shaven-headed caused the topknot to be interpreted as a
protuberance.
44 According to [[MN26]] at MN I 163,30 and its parallel [[MA204]] at T I 776b4, on going forth the bodhisattva shaved his head. [[SNP3.4]] at Sn p. 80,2 and its parallels [[SA1184]] at T II 320b28 and SĀ [2] 99 at T II
409a3 describe how a Brahmin saw the Buddha uncover his head and realized that the Buddha’s head

artists soon took to portraying him with long hair, thereby giving expression to the
semi-divine status he had acquired by their time. [45]

was shaven, which indicates that the Buddha continued to shave his hair. The suggestion by Taddei
1996/2003: 429 that this is the only canonical indication that the Buddha continued to be shaven-headed
does not seem correct (cf. also Burnouf 1852/1925: 562, who assumed that there is no indication at all
that the Buddha shaved his head), as he is qualified as shaven-headed, mu��a, also at Vin IV 91,20.
Again, in [[SNP3.4]] at [[SNP456]] the Buddha says of himself that he has his head-hair shaved off, nivuttakesa.
Thus, Schlingloff 1963b: 55 seems to be right when he concludes that according to the early tradition the
Buddha shaved his hair and beard. Moreover, several passages indicate that the Buddha was not easily
distinguishable from other monks, which he would have been if he had not been shaven-headed: According to [[DN2]] at DN I 50,15 and its parallel [[DA27]] at T I 108a4, King Ajātasattu needed help to recognize the Buddha among a congregation of seated monks. [[MN31]] at MN I 205,20, [[MN128]] at MN III
155,15, [[MA72]] at T I 536b8, [[MA185]] at T I 729c22, and [[EA24.8]] at T II 629b6 report that the guardian
of a park in which three Buddhist monks were living wanted to stop the Buddha from entering this park,
evidently not recognizing who was before him. According to [[MN140]] at MN III 238,8 and its parallels
[[MA162]] at T I 690a27 and T 511 at T XIV 779c15, on meeting the Buddha by chance the monk Pukkusāti was unable to recognize him. The background story to pācittiya rule 92 Vin IV 173,6 records that
other monks mistook Nanda for the Buddha, as the robe he was wearing was similar in length to the Buddha’s robe. A similar account can also be found in the account of the corresponding pātayantika rule 90
in the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, T 1428 at T XXII 695b15, and in the Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, T 1435 at T
XXIII 130b28. These instances suggest that the Buddha did not have longer hair than other monks or
even any other physical mark of a type that would have made it easy for others to recognize him immediately; cf. also Guang Xing 2002b: 10 or id. 2005: 14. Regarding the Buddha being shaven-headed, according to the Mahāvastu in Basak 1968/2004: 110,1 or in Senart 1897: 179,11, Upāli had been responsible for shaving the Buddha’s hair; for additional sources cf. Bareau 1960: 262. Krishan 1966: 281
points out that the early sculptural representations also depict Jain saints with hair, even though according to the literary sources of the Jain tradition these saints had plucked out their hair when going forth.
Ibid p. 282 then explains that the sculptural representations of the Buddha fashioned him after the model
of Brahmā, who “in Indian iconography is invariably endowed with locks of hair”. As Krishan indicates,
to take Brahmā as a model for representing the Buddha is in line with a tendency in the discourses of
comparing the Buddha’s complexion to that of Brahmā, cf., e.g., [[MN95]] at MN II 166,32: “the recluse
Gotama is handsome ... with a Brahmā-like complexion and stature”, sama�o khalu, bho, gotamo abhirūpo ... brahmava��ī brahmavaccasī (B [e] -MN II 379,5 and S [e] -MN II 596,1: brahmavacchasī). In a similar vein, other discourses qualify the Buddha as “become Brahmā”, brahmabhūto, cf., e.g., [[MN18]] at MN
I 111,13, and according to [[SN22.2]] at [[SNP508]] on seeing the Buddha a Brahmin exclaimed that he had met
Brahmā, bhagavā hi me sakkhi Brahm’ ajja di��ho, followed by explaining that the Buddha was like Brahmā, brahmasamo. Although these instances would originally not have been meant in a literal sense, a
more literal understanding of such passages could well have provided a cue to sculptural representation.
45 The tendency towards investing the Buddha with such a status has been repeatedly noted, e.g., Behm
1971: 41 in his study of the Jātakas finds “definite and unmistakeable signs of the divinisation of the
Buddha”. Chaudhary 1994a: 65 remarks that in the course of time the “Buddha was gradually shorn of
human characteristics and superhuman qualities were bestowed on him. He was deified”. Coomaraswamy 1928a: 838 comments that “the activity of the earthly Buddha, originally a living memory, has become, as it were, the līlā of a deity”. Dayal 1932/1970: 28-29 explains that “the competition of the rival
Indian sects and movements also led the Buddhists to advance new claims on behalf of their leader ...
they transformed him into a living immortal, powerful and gracious deva”. Gokhale 1994/2001a: 71
points out that in this way “the Buddha ceases to be an ordinary human being, and is elevated to the
status of a person greater than some of the great gods of the Vedic mythology”. Haldar 1977: 131 notes


Chapter 10 Brāhma�a-vagga                                   -  537


The topknot used in such representations may then have been misunderstood as an
actual protuberance on the Buddha’s head, a feature that soon became standard for
Buddha statues, [46] and was eventually also employed in depicting members of the Buddha’s family. [47]
Two out of the thirty-two marks, the sheathed male organ and the long tongue, are
not perceptible per se, but require an act of demonstration by the Buddha. [48] The Brahmāyu-sutta and its parallels agree that the Buddha did not actually show his private
parts, but rather performed a feat of supernormal power to reveal his condition. [49] In order to display the length of his tongue, according to the Majjhima-nikāya version and


various “characteristics of the Buddha [that] remind us of the Supreme god of Brāhma�ical literature”.
According to Harrison 1978a: 37, “with the passage of time the Buddha became less an object of emulation and more an object of devotion, growing in stature as memories faded”. Horner 1936/1979: 203 observes that “the idea of Gotama as a god ... came more and more to be in the air ... as his life on earth receded into the past ... the urge to worship required some outlet in the present”. Jaini 1970/2001: 87 considers the Buddha’s possession of these thirty-two marks to be an example for the tendency to deify the
Buddha, commenting that “despite its anti-theistic dogma ... early Buddhism had all the ingredients of a
theistic cult”. Karunaratne 1973: 496 explains that the Buddha “was respected, adored and idealised. This
tendency ... culminated in the belief that the Buddha was not a human being, but a superhuman being, a
deva”. Nakamura 1960: 152 and 157 contrasts the early scriptures where the Buddha “was in every respect regarded merely as a superior man”, with later times when “as a consequence of the gradual process of deification ... he works wonders, he is omniscient” (cf. in more detail Nakamura 2000b: 213-225).
Pachow 1976: 267 comments that the Buddha “after his death ... was elevated to the plane of a superman, and then made into a great divinity”, while Werner 1991: 16 speaks of an “elevation of the Buddha
to a cosmic figure, if not a virtual deity”; cf. also Bareau 1974b: 276. Williams 1991: 169-170, however,
holds that “investing a being with divine attributes was common in Ancient India and by no means carried with it the dramatic implications which we assume in a monotheistic culture ... it was natural to refer to the Buddha in terms also used of gods. Such indicated little more than an attitude of deep respect
and humility on the part of his followers”; cf. also ibid. p. 219. Regarding the glorification of the Buddha’s body evident in descriptions of its thirty-two marks, Wüst 1928: 83 notes that this stands in contrast to the negative attitude among early Buddhists towards the human body in general. In line with the
this tendency of investing the Buddha with a superhuman or divine status, the u�hīsa was then understood as representing the Buddha’s omniscience, cf., e.g., the Buddhapādama�gala in Cicuzza 2011:
37,8: u�hīsan ti ... ta� sabbaññutañā�a� nāma ratanamaku�a�, trsl. id. p. 143 as “the u�hīsa ... this
precious crown is called ‘omniscient knowledge’”.
46 Wikramagamage 2005: 293 points out that early Buddha images belonging to the Sri Lankan Mahāvihāra tradition “have no abnormal protuberance on top of their heads”, but “from about the second century A.C.” one can find instances of the “Buddha Image with a slight bump on the top of the head”.
47 Zin 2003b.
48 According to [[SN45.1]] at [[SNP1022]] the Buddha knew that the Brahmin Bāvarī possessed these two marks
(the Chinese counterpart in T 202 at T IV 433b13 attributes only one of these two marks to Bāvarī, the
long tongue, ). The context shows that Bāvarī was not present and also gives the impression that
the Buddha had not met Bāvarī before, which suggests that the Buddha was able to know of these marks
(or at least one of them) without even needing to be in Bāvarī’s presence. This would set a contrast to
other Brahmins, who are not able to recognize these marks even when they are in the presence of the
Buddha, needing the Buddha’s cooperation in order to verify that he possesses these two marks.

the individual translation the Buddha stuck out his tongue to lick his ears and cover his
whole face. [50]
Regarding these demonstrations, it already strikes an odd note for the Buddha to stick
out his tongue, but for him to show off his private parts seems even more bizarre. This
act of demonstration has led to one of the dilemmas in the Milindapañha. [51] In a discussion with King Milinda, the monk Nagasena attempts to explain this act of demonstration by suggesting that the Buddha only created an image and made this visible to his
visitor. When King Milinda still considers this to be inappropriate behaviour, Nagasena
explains that a Tathāgata is willing to go even to such an extent to lead beings to awakening. [52]
The Lakkha�a-sutta of the Dīgha-nikāya records that the Buddha once took up the
topic of these thirty-two marks on his own. [53] The Lakkha�a-sutta’s treatment differs
from other discourses concerned with this topic in as much as it offers a Buddhist perspective on these physical marks, by explaining what particular karmic deeds of the
past had caused the Buddha to be endowed with these thirty-two marks in his present
life. This shifts emphasis from the physical marks themselves to their conditioned nature and their relation to wholesome deeds, thereby highlighting the beneficial results
to be expected of wholesome conduct. [54] The Lakkha�a-sutta in fact explicitly indicates


50 [[MN91]] at MN II 135,17 and T 76 at T I 883c8. [[MA161]] at T I 685c28, however, does not mention any
licking of the ears. Powers 2008: 14 notes that “the idea that a long, supple tongue is a desirable feature
in men is also found in the classical medical text Caraka’s Medical Compendium”; cf. also Coomaraswamy 1938/1977: 169 on what he sees as a related idea in the �gveda. Regarding the symbolic significance of this characteristic, Dayal 1932/1970: 305 suggests that “the long tongue betokens success as a
preacher”. Kramrisch 1935: 165 note 3 explains that the ability of the tongue to reach the ear symbolizes
how the Buddha’s words reach the ears of the world. Wimalaratana 1994: 121 comments that the “long
and slender tongue could as well be symbolic of the Buddha’s tongue’s flexibility for clear accurate enunciation”. The Divyāvadāna in Cowell 1886: 71,14 or in Vaidya 1999: 43,31 reports an occasion when
the Buddha made a demonstration of his long tongue to a Brahmin who was under the impression that
the Buddha had spoken a falsehood. In this context, the display of the tongue’s ability to cover the
whole face stands for truthfulness, confirming that it was impossible for a bearer of this mark to consciously speak a lie.

the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-(upadeśa-)śāstra, T 1509 at T XXV 90b21, cf. also Lamotte 1944/1981: 275,
the Buddha would reveal this characteristic to his disciples by “creating [the magical apparition] of a
horse treasure”, and then indicate that his male organ was like this.

54 Radich 2007: 322 notes that “[[DN30]] contains in embryo the key feature that ... characterise discourse
about the marks in post-Pāli canonical era: a complex allegorical reading of each mark, interpreted in
terms of a vast economy of merit that centres around the Buddha as a kind of world-saviour”. Rhys
Davids 1921: 136 remarks that the Lakkha�a-sutta “seems gravely ironical in the contrast it makes between the absurdity of the marks and the beauty of the ethical qualities they are supposed ... to mean”.
Wimalaratana 1994: 29 comments that “the importance of the Lakkha�a-sutta lies in the fact that it
combines the concept of the Great Man with some of the fundamental tenets of Buddhism such as the
化作馬寶,


Chapter 10 Brāhma�a-vagga                                   -  539


that this shift of emphasis makes the difference between the Buddha’s exposition of
these physical marks and the knowledge outsiders had of them. [55]
With their survey of the thirty-two marks completed, the Brahmāyu-sutta and its parallels continue by describing various aspects of the Buddha’s behaviour. [56] Similar to
the description of the proper way of partaking of food in the Sabbāsava-sutta, [57] the
Brahmāyu-sutta notes that the Buddha would not take food for the sake of ornament or
adornment. [58] The Madhyama-āgama version agrees with the Brahmāyu-sutta, [59] where

doctrine of kamma, rebirth, the law of causation”. The parallel to the Lakkha�a-sutta, [[MA59]] at T I
493c19, differs in this respect, as it only lists the marks of a superior being without giving the detailed
relation to former deeds found in [[DN30]] which might be a later addition to the Pāli discourse. A treatment of the karmic deeds responsible for the marks of a superior being with which the Buddha was endowed can, however, be found in T 584 at T XIV 968a24, in the Lalitavistara in Lefmann 1902: 429,3
or in Vaidya 1958b: 310,5, in a Pañcavi�śatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā passage in Conze 1964: 228,4,
and in the Arthaviniścaya-sūtra in Samtani 1971: 55,4. For a comparative study of the Arthaviniścayasūtra with [[DN30]] cf. Samtani 1962; for a Khotanese fragment where a bodhisattva is encouraged to undertake those actions that will lead to being endowed with the corresponding mark in the future cf. Leumann 1920/1966: 116-122.

part in [[MA161]] at T I 687b5 only takes up three factors, . T 76 at T I 884b2 agrees with [[MN91]] on taking up eight conditions related to the Buddha’s partaking of food, (for a listing of six
purposes when taking food according to the Jain tradition cf. �hā�a�ga 6.500 in Jambūvijaya 1985:
209,10). The factors or purposes listed in [[MN91]] at MN II 138,29 are: n’ eva davāya, “not for amusement”, na madāya, “not for intoxication”, na ma��anāya, “not for ornament”, na vibhūsanāya, “not for
adornment”, yāvadeva imassa kāyassa �hitiyā, “just for the endurance of this body”, yāpanāya, for its
“sustenance”, vihi�sūparatiyā (S [e] -MN II 535,19: vihi�suparatiyā), for “ending discomfort”, brahmacariyānuggahāya, for “assisting the holy life”, iti purā�añ ca vedana� pa�iha�khāmi, “in this way I shall
overcome former feelings”, navañ ca vedana� na uppādessāmi, “I shall not arouse new feelings”, yātrā
ca me bhavissati anavajjatā ca, “so that I will be blameless”, phāsuvihāro cā ti, “and live at ease”. Counting the qualities one by one yields twelve qualities. Grouping them together into subjects according to 三事清淨
the waxing syllable principle results in four main topics: 1) from davāya to 八因緣 vibhūsanāya, representing
improper purposes; 2) from �hitiyā to brahmacariyānuggahāya, concerning maintenance of the body; 3)
pa�iha�khāmi and uppādessāmi, showing the proper way of dealing with feelings; 4) anavajjatā and
phāsuvihāro, describing the result of taking food in this manner. The detailed exposition of these qualities found in Vism 31-33 does not help to determine in what way the present passage should be divided
so as to make up eight factors. One way of arriving at an eightfold presentation would be to set apart the
section that comes after iti, which describes the overcoming of old feelings, the avoidance of new feelings, the blamelessness, and the living at ease, since the preceding factors would amount to eight. This
would imply that the part that begins with iti is a sort of summary of what has been mentioned before. In

as the individual translation does not mention ornament or adornment in relation to
food. [60]

MN II 139  The Brahmāyu-sutta describes that, on returning to the monastery, the Buddha would
sit down cross-legged and establish mindfulness in front, “thinking” of the welfare of
the whole world. [61] While the first part of this description points to the practice of meditation, the use of the verb “to think” (cinteti) suggests a more conceptual type of mental
activity. According to the parallel passage in the Madhyama-āgama version, the Buddha would take his sitting mat and enter a room to sit in meditation. The same version
reports that, on emerging from meditation, the Buddha’s face would be radiant. [62] That
is, in the Madhyama-āgama discourse he clearly engages in actual meditation, an impression also conveyed by the description given in the individual translation. [63] The
Madhyama-āgama version explains that it was precisely the Buddha’s meditation practice that was for the welfare of the whole world. [64]
That the Buddha was in this way setting an example to be emulated would be a conclusion Uttara could indeed draw based on his observations, whereas for him to know


contrast to the difficulty of identifying eight aspects in relation to the Buddha’s partaking of food, descriptions of the Buddha’s voice in [[MN91]] at MN II 140,5, [[MA161]] at T I 687b28, and T 76 at T I 884b23,
which similarly announce eight factors, continue by indeed listing exactly eight qualities of his voice.
Regarding the qualification of the Buddha’s voice in [[MN91]] at MN II 137,5 as brahmassara, a qualification also found in the parallels [[MA161]] at T I 686c5: and T 76 at T I 884a6:, Basu
1986: 117 notes a parallelism between the qualities associated with Brahmā’s voice and the requirement
that at a sacrifice the “superintending priest [must be] having ... a good and sweet voice”.
59 [[MA161]] at T I 687a9 (robes) and T I 687b6 (food): . Notably, in the case of a similar description in [[MN2]] at MN I 10,9 (cf. above p. 31 note 35), the parallel [[MA10]] at T I 432b23 associates the issue of avoiding ornament or adornment to wearing robes. [[MA161]] at T I 687b6 also refers to
not taking alms food for the sake of wealth, .This makes even less sense in relation to alms
food received by a monk and gives the impression that an error in transmission has taken place, where a
pericope meant for the reflection on robes was, perhaps accidentally, applied also to the next item in the
list, to reflection on food. Such a type of error could also explain why in the Pāli tradition the issue of
ornament and adornment is related to food instead of robes. Although the Pāli discourses are consistent 梵音 聲如梵聲
in this respect, unlike Madhyama-āgama discourses (cf. [[MA10]] and [[MA161]]), from a practical perspective it would be more natural to envisage that the problem of ornament and adornment could arise in
relation to using robes instead of in relation to partaking of food. 不為自飾, 不為莊嚴

that the Buddha would sit down to “think” about the welfare of the whole world would
require Uttara to be able to read the Buddha’s mind.
According to the Brahmāyu-sutta and the individual translation, Brahmāyu was so
impressed on hearing the report by his student Uttara that he formally expressed his respect for the Buddha. [65] In the Madhyama-āgama account, Uttara voiced his wish to ordain under the Buddha. [66] Brahmāyu approved of this plan, so that Uttara returned to the
Buddha and went forth.
On a later occasion, when the Buddha had come to the vicinity of Brahmāyu’s place
of residence, Brahmāyu went to visit the Buddha. [67] The three versions agree that Brahmāyu sent one of his students ahead to announce his visit, which according to the Majjhima-nikāya version and the individual translation he did as a matter of propriety. The
Madhyama-āgama account, however, reports that Brahmāyu had seen the great congregation that surrounded the Buddha and felt intimidated, hence he retreated to a nearby
tree root and sent one of his students to announce his arrival. [68]
The Brahmāyu-sutta and its parallels agree in reporting that Brahmāyu was able to
see thirty of the Buddha’s marks of a superior being and requested in verse to be shown
the remaining two. As is usual on such occasions, the Buddha readily responded to this
request by displaying the two marks whose verification requires his cooperation. [69]


65 While according to [[MN91]] at MN II 140,23 he thrice expressed his reverence for the Buddha (with the
namo tassa, etc., formula), according to T 76 at T I 884c16 he thrice bowed down and took refuge. T 76
also notes that through his supernormal powers the Buddha had become aware of the Brahmin’s taking
of refuge.
66 [[MA161]] at T I 687c7. Notably, according to [[MA161]] at T I 686a15 Uttara took leave from the Buddha
by using the address “Gotama”,, which suggests that he did not consider himself a disciple of the
Buddha. Only when he approached the Buddha again to go forth, [[MA161]] at T I 687c11, did he use the
respectful address “Blessed One”, . This is curious, since if Uttara had indeed been so inspired by
the Buddha’s qualities and deportment as to wish to go forth as a Buddhist monk, one would expect this
inspiration to lead to a more respectful way of addressing the Buddha already when he was about to
leave to report what he had seen to Brahmāyu. However, it could also be that this passage is meant to
show his more distant attitude while still being on the mission of inquiry given to him by his teacher
Brahmāyu, and only once he had received permission to go forth under the Buddha did he feel free to
use “Blessed One” as the mode of address that expresses his new allegiance.
67 [[MN91]] at MN II 140,31 and [[MA161]] at T I 687c15 note that the Buddha was staying in Makhādeva’s
Mango Grove, the location where according to [[MN83]] at MN II 78, 瞿曇 22 and its parallels King Makhādeva
and his descendants had spent the final part of their lives in renunciation, cf. above p. 466.
68 [[MA161]] at T I 688a24. The three versions consequently differ on the way the student was told to an- 世尊
nounce Brahmāyu’s visit. According to [[MA161]] at T I 688a25, he was to inquire merely after the Buddha’s health and announce Brahmāyu’s wish to come and visit, while according to [[MN91]] at MN II
141,22 and T 76 at T I 885a4 it was part of his mission to inform the Buddha of the eminent status and
the qualities of his teacher.
69 [[MA161]] at T I 688c21 continues by reporting that the Buddha had realized that Brahmāyu was a sincere
seeker for the truth and therefore decided to teach him the Abhidharma: “I would rather teach him the
profound Abhidharma”, . Yet, the exposition given by the Buddha to Brahmāyu was a poetical description of what according to the Buddha’s teaching are the implications of
reaching awakening, something that would not naturally fit into the category of being Abhidharma.

542   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


MN II 144  Having verified the thirty-two marks, Brahmāyu inquired after the significance of
various epithets that describe a spiritually accomplished person. The Brahmāyu-sutta
and its parallels differ on the epithets employed in this inquiry and in the Buddha’s reply (see table 10.1). [70]
According to all versions, Brahmāyu asked after the implications of being a true
Brahmin. [71] Although this inquiry is found in all versions, only the Chinese versions


70 [[MN91]] lists eight such epithets, while [[MA161]] has four and T 76 five. The epithets in [[MN91]] at MN II
144,12, are a “[true] Brahmin”, one who has “attained highest knowledge” (vedagū), one who has the
“threefold knowledge”, one who is “[truly] learned” (sotthiya), an “arahant”, an “accomplished one”
(kevalin), a “sage” (muni), and a Buddha. [[MA161]] at T I 688c29 lists a “[true] Brahmin”,, one with
the “threefold attainment”,, one “without attachment”,, and one “perfectly and totally awakened”, (or else, following a variant that reads, instead of, one “perfectly and truly
awakened”). The epithets in T 76 at T I 885c1 are a “Brahmin”,, “[having attained] mastery”,,
being “purified”,, being “appeased”,, and “Buddha”, .
71 [[MN91]] at MN II 144,12, [[MA161]] at T I 688c29, and T 76 at T I 885c1. The character-combination
in T 76 literally means “departed mind”. Occurrences of this expression in T 76 at T I 883b11: “at that
time there was a called Brahmāyu”, and in T 76 at T I 885a5: “the Brahmāyu is one-hundredand-twenty years old”, indicate that stands for a “Brahmin” (cf. also Park 2010: 347). This is further supported by the fact that T 76 at T I 883b22 introduces Uttara as “the disciple”; cf. also T 76
at T I 884c19+26, which list the visitors of the Buddha as “the king of the country, [his] ministers, 梵志
and householders”. At the same time, however, T 76 repeatedly uses the more common way of render- 三達 無著
ing Brahmin 正盡覺 as, cf., e.g., T 76 at T 聖 I 885c1: “the [Brahmāyu] 真 said” 盡, or T 76 at T I 885c17: “Buddha told the [Brahmāyu]”. According to Nattier 2003b: 235, 逝心 “variety in translation terminology, 通達
often using multiple translations of a given term ... even within a single text 淨 寂然 佛 ” is a prominent characteristic of Zhī Qīan’s ( ) translations, which would explain why T 76 has two modes of rendering Brah- 逝心
min side by side. The choice of as an alternative rendering of “Brahmin” could be related to an
etymology suggested in [[DN27]] at DN III 94, 逝心 1: pāpake akusale dhamme bāhentī ti kho ... brāhma�ā 逝心, in

Norman 1991/1993c: 275 explains that “in brahmanical Hinduism a brahman (< b��h – ‘to be strong’)
was a brahman by birth, and was a kinsman of 梵志 Brahmā 梵志 ”, in contrast to which “the Buddha ... by adopting
a different etymology 梵志 (< b��h       - ‘to destroy’) ... was able to justify his view that a brahman was one who
had destroyed evil”; on this type of ‘etymological’ explanation cf. also Balbir 1991: 133, Bhattacharya
1986: 294, Brough 支謙 1962/2001: 178, Eltschinger 2000: 17, Gombrich 2009: 181, Mette 1973: 33, Schneider 1954: 578, von Hinüber 1995b: 188, and von Simson 1986: 93. Thus, in the case of the expression 逝心
used in T 76, might render bāheti, “to discard, to keep away”. The use of is more difficult to account for, perhaps this intends to render the ºma�a part of brāhma�a, mistaken to be related to manas,
“mind”. Alternatively, the idea might be that the “mind” of a Brahmin has “departed” from all evil. The
Pāli commentary at Ps III 397,24 takes up the etymology of the term Brahmin as one who has “discarded
evil”, explaining that the reference in [[MN91]] at MN II 144,21 to one who “knows the mind to be purified
and free from lust”, citta� visuddha� jānāti, mutta� rāgehī ti, stands for the dictum that by discarding
evil one becomes a Brahmin, bāhitapāpattā brāhma�o ti. This makes it quite possible that a similar
gloss was also found in an ancient Indian commentary to T 76, of which Zhī Qīan may have been aware.
In fact, the same etymology recurs in the other Chinese parallel to the present discourse, [[MA161]] at T I
689a3, according to which “eradicating evil and unwholesome things ... by this [one is] a Brahmin”,
逝 . The same etymology can also be found in the Mahāvastu 心 in Basak 1968/2004:

惡不善法 ... 以此為梵志

give an explicit answer to this inquiry. The Madhyama-āgama version explains that by
overcoming evil and practising the holy life one deserves to be reckoned a Brahmin, [72]
while the individual translation indicates that possession of the three knowledges makes
one a Brahmin. [73]

The Majjhima-nikāya version records that Brahmāyu asked after the implication of
being a sage (muni). Although this query is not found in the Madhyama-āgama version,
the same discourse offers an explanation of this term similar to the Majjhima-nikāya version’s reply. [74] Thus it seems as if the Madhyama-āgama discourse may have lost Brah

māyu’s inquiry after a sage (muni), while in the Majjhima-nikāya version an explicit reply to what makes one a true Brahmin appears to be missing, [75] so that in both versions
the verse exchange has apparently not been preserved in full.
In spite of variations in regard to terminology, in all versions this exchange with Brahmāyu led from an examination of the physical marks of a superior being to the Buddha’s explanation of what really makes one a superior being, thereby introducing a redefinition or perhaps even re-evaluation of the concept of a mahāpurisa/mahāpuru�a. [76]
According to all versions, Brahmāyu was highly inspired by the Buddha’s reply. While
the Madhyama-āgama version only reports that he got up and wanted to worship the
Buddha, [77] according to the Majjhima-nikāya version and the individual translation he
actually kissed and caressed the Buddha’s feet. [78] In all versions, Brahmāyu’s worship
caused amazement among the assembled congregation.

MN II 145   The Brahmāyu-sutta and its parallels report that the Buddha gave Brahmāyu a gradual instruction that culminated in an exposition of the four noble truths, hearing which
Brahmāyu attained realization. [79] Brahmāyu then took refuge and invited the Buddha
and his monks for a meal the next day. [80] The Madhyama-āgama version reports that at
the conclusion of the meal the Buddha spoke a set of stanzas in praise of the superiority


planation found also in [[SN7.8]] at SN I 167,1 (or SN [2] 194 at SN [2] I 357,10), [[SN7.13]] at SN I 175,22 (or
SN [2] 199 at SN [2] I 377,5), [[AN3.58]] at AN I 165,28, [[AN3.59]] at AN I 167,30, [[DHP|DHP423]] It 3:5:10 at It 100,21,
[[SN22.3]] at [[SNP647]] and Thī 63-64.
75 According to Ps III 397,24, however, the inquiry after the Brahmin was answered implicitly by the reference to the purified mind in [[MN91]] at MN II 144,21.
76 A similar re-evaluation can be seen in other Pāli discourses. Thus, e.g., [[SN47.11]] at SN V 158,14 defines the mahāpurisa as one whose mind is liberated, vimuttacitta. According to [[AN4.35]] at AN II 36,4,
one who practises for the welfare of many, has control over the mind, attains the four jhānas, and has
destroyed the influxes deserves to be reckoned a mahāpurisa. [[DHP|DHP352]] reckons one who bears his last
body a mahāpurisa, and [[SN45.3]] at [[SNP1042]] uses the same qualification for one who has gone beyond
craving. Radich 2007: 313 holds such passages to be later than those where the mahāpurisa is depicted
in terms of physical characteristics, since the above passages employ different terms and hence “nothing
here gives the impression that we are dealing with a coherent ... conception of mahāpurisa; the impression is rather that in each case we see a more or less ad hoc appropriation of a valorised term, on the fly”.
This then leads Radich (p. 329) to assume “an ‘ethical’ reinterpretation of an originally corporeal notion”.
This conclusion does not seem to take into account that the above instances refer to the very same idea
of a fully awakened one, only expressed in different terms. Moreover, lack of stereotyping in orally
transmitted material would rather be a mark of earliness and originality, instead of being an unequivocal
sign of later development.

going for refuge. On the motif of caressing the Buddha’s feet cf. above p. 511.
79 While [[MN91]] at MN II 145,13 describes that he attained the Dharma-eye and [[MA161]] at T I 689b23 that
he had a personal vision of the four noble truths, the description in T 76 at T I 885c28 is somewhat cryptic, although it seems to entail the same. T 76 at T I 885c29 additionally indicates that Brahmāyu’s quick
understanding was due to his observance of pure morality and respectful behaviour during past life encounters with former Buddhas.

of a Buddha, [81] a set of stanzas not found in the Majjhima-nikāya version or in the individual translation.
The three versions agree that not long after this meal Brahmāyu passed away as a
non-returner. [82] The Majjhima-nikāya version and the individual translation conclude
with the rejoicing of the monks, to which the Madhyama-āgama version adds that
Brahmāyu (presumably earlier) had also rejoiced in the discourse. [83]


[[MN92]] Sela-sutta

The Sela-sutta, the “discourse to Sela”, describes the conversion of the Brahmin Sela
and his students. [84] This discourse recurs under the same title in the Sutta-nipāta and
has a parallel in the Ekottarika-āgama. [85] In addition, the events covered in the Sela-sutta are also recorded in the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya and in the Bhai�ajyavastu of the
(Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya. [86]
The Sela-suttas, their Ekottarika-āgama parallel, and the accounts found in the Dharmaguptaka and (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinayas report that after hearing a discourse from


81 [[MA161]] at T I 689c14. A similar set of stanzas spoken by the Buddha at the completion of a meal can be
found in [[SNP3.7]] at [[SNP568-569]] and in Vin I 246,33, with the difference that, while the Pāli stanzas end in
praising the Sa�gha as the most profitable field of merit, in [[MA161]] the final stanza reckons the Buddha
as supreme among all beings. Anesaki 1901: 898 notes that this set of stanzas recurs frequently in the
Āgamas. Although these stanzas are absent from the Chinese counterpart to [[SNP3.7]] at [[SNP568-569]] [[EA49.6]] at T II 800b19, similar stanzas are found in other Ekottarika-āgama discourses, cf., e.g., [[EA18.4]] at
T II 589b3, [[EA26.6]] at T II 637c2, [[EA33.2]] at T II 684a9, [[EA34.5]] at T II 694c13, [[EA37.10]] at T II 717a6,
[[EA44.9]] at T II 768b27, and [[EA45.7]] at T II 775b21. A similar set of stanzas occurs also, e.g., in SĀ [2] 52
at T II 391b17 (translated in Bingenheimer 2009: 150) and SĀ [2] 259 at T II 465a26 (translated in Choong

p. 312 comments that “this shows a great discrepancy” as Brahmāyu “was already reported dead in the
preceding paragraph”. Perhaps Brahmāyu’s delighted reaction came originally right after the exposition
given to him by the Buddha. When during the course of transmission the discourse was provided with a
more extensive conclusion in order to report what happened afterwards, the passage on the delighted reaction of the listeners (including Brahmāyu) would then have been shifted to the end of the discourse,
without the reciters noticing that this almost gives the impression as if Brahmāyu rejoiced in hearing the
news of his own passing away. Cf. also above p. 193 note 255 and p. 209 note 31.

the Buddha, Ke�iya invited the Buddha and the monks for a meal. [87] Ke�iya’s offering
of beverages to the Buddha and the monks is also recorded in the Mahīśāsaka and
Theravāda Vinayas, both of which continue by describing how Ke�iya treated the
Buddha to a meal, an account similar to the introductory narration in the Sela-suttas. [88]
The Sela-suttas do not give details about the nature of the discourse the Buddha had
given to Ke�iya. According to the Ekottarika-āgama account, Ke�iya had asked for the
Buddha’s opinion on the Brahminical claim to class superiority. In reply, the Buddha
examined this claim in detail, bringing up several arguments employed also in the Assalāyana-sutta and its Chinese parallels. [89] Satisfied by the Buddha’s exposition, Ke�iya took refuge and invited the Buddha and his monks for the next day’s meal.
While the Ekottarika-āgama version and the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya simply report that the Buddha accepted the invitation, according to the Sela-suttas and the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya the Buddha refused twice, warning Ke�iya that the congregation of
monks was rather large. In fact, in the Sela-suttas and in the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya
the disciples of the Buddha number one-thousand-two-hundred-and-fifty, [90] making it a
considerable task to provide them all with food. [91]


87 [[SNP3.7]] at Sn p. 103,2 introduces Ke�iya as a matted-hair ascetic (cf. also Therāpadāna 389:26 at Ap
318,14, which qualifies him as a tāpasa), whereas [[EA49.6]] at T II 798b5 presents him as a Brahmin. According to Ps III 399,5, the matted-hair ascetic Ke�iya came indeed from an eminent Brahmin family.
The Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, T 1428 at T XXII 873a26, also refers to him as a Brahmin, whereas the
(Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya in Dutt 1984a: 262,10 speaks of him as a seer.
88 T 1421 at T XXII 151b28 and Vin I 245,25, an offering of beverages also recorded in the Mahāsā�ghika
Vinaya, T 1425 at T XXII 464a29, the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, Dutt 1984a: 262,19, and the Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, T 1435 at T XXIII 193a23; cf. also Jaworski 1930: 83-85 and 109-115.
89 [[EA49.6]] at T II 798b19 takes up the class of someone born from a couple of mixed Brahmin and warrior
class and compares this situation to a mule, similar to the argument given in [[MN93]] at MN II 153,12, cf.
also below p. 554 note 130. [[EA49.6]] at T II 798c14 continues by comparing a skilled and knowledgeable
Brahmin youth to his ignorant brother, similar to [[MN93]] at MN II 154,3, followed in [[EA49.6]] at T II
798c21 by contrasting the skilled brother’s unwholesome behaviour and lack of restraint with his ignorant brother’s restraint and wholesome conduct, similar to an argument found in [[MN93]] at MN II 154,11.
[[EA49.6]] at T II 798c27 then compares a learned Brahmin youth of pure descent from the mother’s side
to an unlearned Brahmin youth of pure descent from the father’s side, followed in [[EA49.6]] at T II 799a9
by contrasting a learned Brahmin youth of wholesome conduct with a wise Brahmin youth (or one who
is not wise according to a variant reading) who is of unwholesome conduct. In all these instances
Ke�iya had to admit that class was overruled by other qualities. [[EA49.6]] at T II 799a21 then brings up
the example of a foreign country in which only masters and slaves are found, similar to [[MN93]] at MN II
149,4. The last argument offered in [[EA49.6]] at T II 799a27 briefly refers to the mythical account of the
origin of class and sex distinctions after one of the cyclic destructions of the earth, in some respects
similar to an argument found in [[DN27]] at DN III 84,25.
90 By presenting the Buddha in the company of one-thousand-two-hundred-and-fifty disciples, [[SNP3.7]] at
Sn p. 102,20 (= [[MN92]]) and T 1428 at T XXII 873b24 provide a favourable contrast to Sela, who according to both versions had less disciples, as [[SNP3.7]] at Sn p. 105,3 counts three hundred disciples and T 1428
at T XXII 873b16 five hundred followers (in the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya version in Dutt 1984a:
265,2 he also has five hundred disciples). In [[EA49.6]] at T I 798a 明 26+29, however, the disciples of the
Buddha and the disciples of Sela both number five hundred. In general, the Pāli tradition tends to use


Chapter 10 Brāhma�a-vagga                                   -  547


The Pāli and Chinese discourses report in similar terms that the Brahmin Sela chanced
upon the preparations for the meal offering at Ke�iya’s place. Told by Ke�iya that the
preparations were for a Buddha, Sela decided to visit the Buddha himself. [92] Once he
was in the presence of the Buddha, according to the Sela-suttas and the Ekottarikaāgama account Sela was able to verify thirty of the marks of a superior being, while
the other two marks were revealed to him by the Buddha. [93]
The Dharmaguptaka Vinaya account continues by narrating that Sela made an offering of beverages to the monks, [94] an offering that according to the Mahīśāsaka, (Mūla-)
Sarvāstivāda, and Theravāda Vinayas had rather been made by Ke�iya before inviting
the Buddha and the monks to the meal. [95]
The Pāli versions report that Sela decided to extol the Buddha, [96] as he thought that on
being praised the Buddha would reveal his qualities. [97] According to the Chinese account,


predominantly the number five hundred when describing a congregation of the Buddha’s disciples,
while the Ekottarika-āgama makes a frequent use of the number one-thousand-two-hundred-and-fifty,
cf. above p. 419 note 141. Malalasekera 1937/1995: 22 takes the Pāli version’s count of disciples to reflect actual conditions and concludes that the A�guttarāpa country “was probably rich, because we find
as many [[BU-AS1250]] monks accompanying the Buddha”.
91 According to the Pāli commentary, Ps III 400,1, the three hundred disciples of Sela should also be added
to this count, since the Buddha already at this point knew that they would also go forth and thus come
along for the next day’s meal.
92 While [[SNP3.7]] at Sn p. 106,3 reports that Sela ascertained twice if he had properly understood that a Buddha had been invited, according to [[EA49.6]] at T II 799b25 a single question and answer on this topic
were sufficient. T 1428 at T XXII 873b28 reports three such inquiries (according to Vin II 155,20, in a
similar situation Anāthapi��ika also went so far as to ask three times if he had properly understood that
a “Buddha” had been invited for a meal). [[SNP3.7]] at Sn p. 107,3 reports that Sela instructed his disciples
not to interrupt his conversation with the Buddha, an instruction not found in [[EA49.6]]
93 According to [[EA49.6]] at T II 799c10, Sela asked in verse to be shown the remaining two marks. [[SNP3.7]]
at Sn p. 107,17 does not record such a request, but only indicates that the Buddha became aware of Sela’s wish, perhaps through his telepathic powers.

95 T 1421 at T XXII 151b28, Dutt 1984a: 262,19, and Vin I 245,25. Another variation on the events narrated in [[MN92]] can be found in the *Karmavibha�gopadeśa in Lévi 1932a: 155,16, according to which
Sela was an ascetic (tāpasa) and it was he who had invited the Buddha for a meal.
96 Sela’s stanzas recur at Th 818-841; for a study of different versions of the stanza found in [[SNP3.7]] at [[SNP558]] or at Th 828 cf. Skilling 2005; cf. also Baums 2009: 344. The Divyāvadāna in Cowell 1886: 20,23
and 35,1 or in Vaidya 1999: 12,25 and 21,9 refers to “verses [spoken by] Sela”, śailagāthā, in the context of a listing of selected discourses; cf. also Rhys Davids 1896: 94. Such a reference is also found in
the Chinese and Tibetan versions of the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, T 1448 at T XXIV 11b6:
and D (1) ’dul ba, ka 265b2 or Q (1030) khe 249b1 and again D (1) ’dul ba ga 225b1 or Q (1030) nge
214b5: ri gnas kyi tshigs su bcad pa; cf. also Lamotte 1956: 260 and Lévi 1915: 418. Another similar
reference can be found in [[SA1321]] at T II 362c12:, also occuring in the context of a listing of
different texts, preceded by references to versions of the Therīgāthā and the Theragāthā.
97 The suggestion that the Buddha can be made to praise himself if he is publicly extolled is surprising.
Horner 1957/1970: 335 note 4 comments that “in the Buddha’s Teaching this is what a foolish person
does, e.g. Devadatta, not arahants and ... not the Tathāgata”. She refers to [[DN28]] at DN III 115,20, according to which the Tathāgata does not reveal his qualities. Another relevant passage would be [[MN22]]

however, Sela inquired about the path to liberation. In reply, the Buddha expounded
the noble eightfold path, an exposition that caused Sela to attain stream-entry. [98]
The Pāli and Chinese versions agree that Sela informed his disciples of his wish to go
forth under the Buddha, to which they replied by declaring that they would follow suit.
Thus, in the Ekottarika-āgama version Sela’s wish to go forth arose after an exposition of the path to liberation that had caused him to become a stream-enterer. In contrast, according to the Sela-suttas he rather wanted to go forth after hearing the Buddha’s claim to be fully awakened, a claim made in reply to an eulogy of the Buddha by
Sela. [99]
The Ekottarika-āgama version continues by reporting that the Buddha expounded the
four noble truths to his new monk disciples, with the result that all of them became arahants. [100] The Sela-suttas also record that Sela and his disciples became arahants, although,
according to their description, this happened after the meal offering by Ke�iya and was
the result of diligent practice in seclusion. [101]
According to the Ekottarika-āgama version, Ke�iya was very pleased when he saw
Sela and his Brahmin disciples turn up at the meal offering as Buddhist monks. [102] The
Ekottarika-āgama version records that at the end of the meal Ke�iya and his family
took refuge.
The Buddha then delivered a teaching to the assembled multitude, concluding with a
set of stanzas on the heavenly retribution to be expected for doing what is wholesome and
meritorious. [103] The Sela-suttas do not record such a sermon. According to them, the

Hence, one would not expect that, on being praised, he would react by praising himself. Pérez-remón
1980: 70 comments that “such statements of self-praise” probably “reflect more the high appreciation
of the Buddha professed by his followers than the very way he spoke”.
98 [[EA49.6]] at T II 800a18. Compared to [[SNP3.7]] for the Buddha to give Sela an exposition of the path to
liberation seems more in line with what other discourses depict as the usual strategy adopted by him
when faced with prospective disciples. It would also be natural for Sela to wish to go forth after he had
attained stream-entry and thereby verified for himself that he had an awakened teacher in front of him.
99 The (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, Dutt 1984a: 264,5, simply reports that Sela went with his disciples to
the Buddha and asked to be ordained, without recording any conversation between him and the Buddha.
100 [[EA49.6]] at T II 800a29.
101 [[SNP3.7]] at Sn p. 112,6. Two of the stanzas with which they declare their attainment, [[SNP3.7]] at [[SNP571572]] recur in [[SNP3.6]] at [[SNP545-546]] as part of Sabhiya’s praise of the Buddha. Compared to [[EA49.6]] [[SNP3.7]] offers a more plausible account. Although in certain instances a particularly gifted individual apparently was able to become an arahant in a very short time (cf., e.g., the case of Bāhiya in [[UD1.10]] at [[UD8.13]] or the case of Yasa in Vin I 17,3), it would be rather unusual for the same to take place in the case
of five hundred, i.e., a ‘substantially large number’, of newly ordained disciples. Moreover, expositions

Buddha expressed his appreciation of the meal offering with two stanzas on the supreme merit that accrues to those who make offerings to the Sa�gha. [104]


[[MN93]] Assalāyana-sutta

The Assalāyana-sutta, the “discourse to Assalāyana”, records a debate between the
Buddha and the Brahmin youth Assalāyana on the Brahminical claim to class superiority. This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama and another parallel in an individual translation. [105] In addition to these, the final part of the Assalāyana-sutta has a
counterpart in a discourse in the Ekottarika-āgama and in a discourse quotation in
Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya, extant in Tibetan. [106] A
few parts of a version of the Assalāyana-sutta have also been preserved in Sanskrit
fragments. [107]
The Assalāyana-sutta and its two Chinese parallels begin by describing how a group of
Brahmins prevailed on Assalāyana that he should defend the Brahminical claim to
class superiority in front of the Buddha. [108] The present and other instances in the early
discourses of such debates on the presumed class superiority of Brahmins seem to reflect some degree of tension and probably also of competition between orthodox Brahmins and the Buddha as representative of the recluse (sama�a) tradition. [109 ]


104 [[SNP3.7]] at [[SNP568-569]] a set of stanzas also found in the account of Ke�iya’s meal offering in Vin I
246,33 (cf. also above p. 545 note 81), but absent from the account of his offering in T 1421 and T 1428.
105 The parallels are [[MA151]] at T I 663b-666c and T 71 at T I 876b-878b. According to the information
given in the Taishō edition, T 71 was translated by Dharmarak�a. [[MA151]] and T 71 agree with [[MN93]]
on locating the discourse in Jeta’s Grove by Sāvatthī. [[MA151]] has the title “discourse to the Brahmin
Assalāyana”, with a variant reading as, cf. also Abhidh-k-�, which
gives the title as rta len gyi bu’i mdo. T 71 has the title “discourse on the Brahmin Assalāyana’s questions about class superiority”, . [[MA151]] has been studied and translated by
Minh Chau 1964/1991: 61 and 313-320.

with its Chinese counterparts in T 1558 at T XXIX 44c26 and T XXIX 45a1, as well as T 1559 at T

Klaus Wille (I am indebted to Jens-Uwe Hartmann for kindly providing me with a preliminary draft 梵志阿攝惒經 ( 聖 梵志阿攝和經)
transliteration of these fragments). The fragments correspond to the final part of the discussion with
Assalāyana at MN II 154-155, in particular to his showing physical signs of being defeated and to the 梵志頞波羅延問種尊經
tale of the seven seers.
108 While according to [[MN93]] at MN II 147,3 these Brahmins came from different provinces of India, nānāverajjaka, [[MA151]] at T I 663b28 indicates that they were from Kosala, . Another minor difference is that, according to [[MN93]] at MN II 148,6 and T 71 at T I 876c22, it took three requests by the
Brahmins to convince Assalāyana to take up their cause, whereas according to [[MA151]] at T I 664a9 two
requests were sufficient. T 71 at T I 876c26 also makes a point of explicitly recording that Assalāyana
and the Brahmins did not pay homage to the Buddha, .

MN II 148   According to the Majjhima-nikāya account, the Buddha humorously contrasted the
Brahminical claim to be born from the mouth of Brahmā with the empirically observ
be noticed by Megasthenes, cf. McCrindle 1877: 98. According to Patañjali’s Vyākara�a-mahābhā�ya
in Kielhorn 1880/1962: 476,9 (2.4.12.2), these two groups are opposed to each other, ye�ā� ca virodha
ityasyāvakāśa�, śrama�abrāhma�am. As already highlighted by, e.g., Foucher 1955: 260, these two
sections of ancient Indian society were not only opposed to each other on ideological grounds, but were
also in direct competition for the material support they required for their sustenance from the population (Gräfe 1974: 37 notes that the support to be given to Brahmins is reflected in references to the brāhma�abhojana at Vin I 44,22 and Vin I 60,25). Olivelle 1974: 6 explains that “according to the Vi��usm�ti a householder must turn back if he has seen ... a recluse, and a punishment of 100 pa�as is ordained ‘for hospitably entertaining ... a religious ascetic at an oblation to the gods or to the manes’ ...
the sight itself of ... [a recluse] was considered by many as inauspicious. There was also a corresponding hostility towards the brāhma�as on the part of the recluses. In heterodox literature the brāhma�as
are depicted as greedy social parasites living on the superstitious generosity of the common people”.
Nevertheless, as pointed out by Ruegg 2008: 5 note 3, “whether ... the śrama�as and brāhma�as are in
fact opposed depends of course on the circumstance in each case”. Ruegg remarks that it also needs to
be taken into account that quite a number of bhikkhus were of Brahmin descent (cf. the survey in Chakravarti 1996: 198-220, Nakamura 2000a: 360-362, and Sarao 1989: 93-139, and the figures given in
Gokhale 1976: 96, id. 1980a: 74, or id. 1994/2001c: 61). In fact, according to Vin I 71,25, ja�ilas were
allowed to join the order without observing the usual probationary period; cf. also Bronkhorst 1998b:
84. Bailey 2003: 112 explains that “the jostling for status between brahmins and Buddhists ... should
not necessarily be taken as antagonism. But it is competition”. Fog 1994: 37 comments that “the religious competition between them also implied an exchange of ideas and symbols ... [which] explains the
extensive use of Brāhma�a terminology and religious symbols ... within the world view of the Nikāyas”.
On the not invariably hostile relationships between Brahmins and early Buddhists cf. also Tsuchida 1991.

able fact that Brahmin mothers go through the normal process of pregnancy. [110] While
the Madhyama-āgama version does not record this argument, the individual translation
raises the same argument at a later point of its presentation. [111] The pregnancy of Brahmin wives as an argument against the Brahminical claim to be born from Brahmā’s
mouth recurs also in the Aggañña-sutta and in its Dīrgha-āgama and Madhyama-āgama parallels. [112]
The Assalāyana-sutta and its two Chinese parallels agree in taking up some border
regions of India in which a two-class society can be found, [113] a society where master
and slave may exchange their roles. [114] The circumstance that the Assalāyana-sutta in
this context refers to Yona has at times been taken as a sign of lateness. [115] Yet, closer


110 [[MN93]] at MN II 148,29. Gombrich 1992a: 164 comments that “this means that the brahmins have the
same impurities from birth as other human beings”. According to Norman 1991/1993c: 272, by referring to “the way in which brahmans are born, the Buddha satirises the Puru�asūkta of the �gveda”; cf.
also Gombrich 1988: 77 and Schmithausen 2005a: 170. Bronkhorst 2007: 212, however, doubts that
the Buddha had knowledge of this Vedic hymn.
111 T 71 at T I 877b24. T 71 differs in so far as it covers the pregnancy of all four classes, thereby indicating that Brahmins are not different from the other three classes in respect to birth.

113 According to [[MN93]] at MN II 149,4, this is the case in “Yona, Kamboja, and other border regions”, yona-kambojesu aññesu ca paccantimesu janapadesu (S [e] -MN II 560,18: yonaka-kambojesu). Aśoka’s
fifth rock edict similarly speaks of Yona and Kamboja and other western border countries that are occupied by servants and masters, cf. Bloch 1950: 103, Hultzsch 1925: 191, or Woolner 1924/1993: 8-9.
Bodhi in Ñā�amoli 1995/2005: 1299 note 872 explains that “Yona is the Pāli transliteration of Ionia.
Kamboja is a region to the northwest of the Indian ‘Middle Country’”; cf. also Basak 1963a: 18, Law
1932/1979: 50, and Malalasekera 1937/1995: 526. Kamboja as one of the sixteen Indian countries recurs in [[AN3.70]] at AN I 213,4, [[AN8.42]] at AN IV 252,8, [[AN8.43]] at AN IV 256,20, and [[AN8.45]] at
AN IV 261,1. King Milinda apparently came from the Yona region, as according to Mil 1,11, 82,23, and
83,1 he was a native of Kalasigāma in Alasanda, two hundred yojanas from the town of Sāgala of the
Yona district. The Mahāva�[[SA12]].4-5 in B [e] -Mhv 68 reports that the Yona country was converted to
Buddhism after the third of the councils recognized in the Theravāda tradition. While [[MA151]] at T I
664a18 agrees with [[MN93]] on speaking of Yona and Kamboja,, T 71 at T I 877a13
speaks instead of the Ku�ā�as, .
114 [[MA151]] at T I 664a19 agrees with [[MN93]] at MN II 149,6 on contrasting “slave”,, with “master”, .
T 71 at T I 877a11 instead contrasts “slave” with “clansman”,, corresponding to kulaputta.
The three versions also differ in regard to the conclusion drawn after the various arguments. [[MN93]] concludes each argument by indicating that the Brahminical claim to class superiority has been invalidated,
a reasoning found in similar terms (though only on one occasion) in T 71 at T I 877c18. [[MA151]] instead
follows each argument by indicating that each of the four classes will be able to reach understanding as
long as they adopt the right path, cf., e.g., [[MA151]] at T I 664a22: “Brahmins ... warriors, merchants, and
workers, if they [practise] the right approach, they will obtain good understanding and know by themselves in accordance with the Dharma”, 餘尼及劒浮國 .
115 Bronkhorst 2007: 209 holds that 月支國 the mention of Yona “suggests that the passage which contains this reference was composed after  - perhaps long after  - the conquest of Alexander the 奴 Great”; cf. also Bechert 大家
1961: 41 note 2, Lamotte 1947: 217, and Winternitz 1920/1968: 40, who comments that the reference 人善家子
to Yona points to the existence of the Greek-Bactrian kingdom and therewith to a time shortly before
Aśoka.

inspection brings to light that a reference to Yona could well have arisen already at the
time of the Buddha. [116]
The individual translation offers additional details on the argument made in this passage, as it explains that by dint of good conduct a slave can become a free man, while a
free man who undertakes evil conduct may end up having to sell himself as a slave. [117]
Thus, from the perspective of this version, the point of the argument appears to be to
contrast the Brahminical belief in being the inheritors of a divinely fixed order with the
existence of masters and slaves in other societies, where their respective status would
be due to their own deeds. [118]

116 Regarding the term itself, Kent 1950/1953: 204 s.v. Yauna notes that the term Yauna occurs in an inscription by Darius I (who reigned 522-486 BC), the corresponding Sanskrit form Yavana occurs in
Pā�ini 4.1.49; for a survey of references to Yavana or Yona cf. also Karttunen 1997: 316-320 and
Narain 1957: 165-169. Töttössy 1955: 310-311 explains that “the term Yona-” was “taken over into
Indian from the Old Persian form Yauna- some time about the end of the sixth century B.C.”; cf. also
Ray 1988: 312. In regard to the reference to the writing of the Yavanas in Pā�ini, Bühler 1895/1963: 27
note 1 comments that “it seems to me not wonderful that an author ... whose countrymen, the Gandhāras,
had furnished a contingent for Xerxes’s invasion of Greece, should mention the old Oriental name of
the Greeks ... to me it seems absolutely impossible to make the mere occurrence of the word Yavana in
Sanskrit works a mark, which proves that they must have been written after the invasion of Alexander”.
Sircar 1953: 101-102 comments that “the Greeks of Ionia in Asia Minor ... and the people of northwestern India certainly came into contact with each other ... since the time of Darius I (522-486 B.C.)”.
Given that “Indian archers ... formed an important element in the army of Xerxes and shared the Persian defeat ... the people of Uttarāpatha at least had direct knowledge of the Greeks as early as the sixth
and fifth centuries B.C.”. It “is therefore no wonder that the very word Yauna, meaning the Greeks, used
for the first time in the records of Darius I, was borrowed by the Indians without any modification”. In
fact, a famous detail of Xerxes’s campaign to conquer Greece in 480 BC was the heroic resistance offered by the Spartans under Leonidas, so that it would indeed not be surprising if some knowledge of
their valour, and perhaps also of their social division into two classes of master and slaves, should have
been known in India already by the later part of the fifth century BC from reports given by Indians who
had taken part in Xerxes’s campaign. Since this campaign was in revenge for the support given by the
mainland Greeks to the Ionian revolt against Persian dominion, it would also not be surprising if the Indians referred to the Spartans as “people from Yona”. That this rumour may have been still fairly new
would fit the formulations in [[MN93]] at MN II 149,4 and [[MA151]] at T I 664a18, both of which agree that
the Buddha made a point of ascertaining if Assalāyana had already ‘heard’ (suta/ ) about the conditions in these border countries. Since according to modern scholarship the Buddha’s teaching activities
could be assigned to the second half of the fifth century and perhaps even early fourth century (cf., e.g.,
Bechert 1995: 286, Brekke 1998: 32, and Cousins 1996b: 60), it would appear entirely possible that the
Buddha and his contemporaries had indeed heard of the Spartan two-class society, to which they referred
to as the Yona country. Thus, as already noted by Basham 1980: 23 note 2, the reference to Yona in
[[MN93]] “is not ... conclusive for a late date”. Halbfass 1995: 199 sums up: “references to yona, etc., in
the Pali canon need not be later interpolations, added after Alexander’s campaign. They may well go
back to the oldest layers of the canon”; cf. also Anālayo 2009x.
117 T 71 at T I 877a14.
118 The commentary Ps III 409,16, however, explains the present argument in [[MN93]] by narrating how a 聞
childless Brahmin trader might go with his wife to these border countries and then pass away. His wife
might then consort with a slave and have a child. This child might follow his father’s trade and eventually return to the middle country and take a Brahmin wife. Due to his impure descent, the children re

The topic of wholesome and evil deeds comes up again in the Assalāyana-sutta and
the individual translation, which take up the retribution for wholesome and evil ways
of conduct. The two versions point out that, just as wholesome conduct will lead to a
heavenly rebirth, so evil conduct will lead to hell, independent of class affiliation. [119]
Although the Madhyama-āgama discourse does not record this argument, it agrees
with the Assalāyana-sutta on bringing up the practice of loving kindness, an argument
not found in the individual translation. According to the Majjhima-nikāya and Madhyama-āgama versions, Assalāyana had to admit that members of any of the four classes
(va��a) would be able to practice loving kindness, the practice of this ‘brahma’-vihāra
not being a prerogative of Brahmins. [120]
The Assalāyana-sutta and its Chinese parallels also point out that a member of any
class will be able to wash himself, thereby punning on the Brahminical notion that only
Brahmins are able to purify themselves. [121] The individual translation additionally inquires whether anyone could recognize the dirt washed away in the water to be the dirt
of a Brahmin, a warrior, a merchant, or a worker. [122]
The Majjhima-nikāya version and its Madhyama-āgama counterpart compare the
ability of high-class members to make fire with superior types of wood to low-class
members who make fire with inferior types of wood. Both come to the conclusion that
any of the resultant fires can be used, and their colour and flame will be similar to the
other fires. [123] The individual translation instead describes members of the four classes
that come close to a fire during the cold season and concludes that the fire will warm
them all. [124]
In addition to these practical examples concerned with washing and making a fire,
the two Chinese discourses also bring up the argument that a member of any class will


sulting from this marriage will not be pure Brahmins. As in this way it can be imagined how Brahmins
can come to be of impure descent, the Brahminical claim to class superiority is rendered invalid. The
point the commentary tries to make seems rather contrived and could be modelled on [[DN3]] at DN I 93,16,
where the Buddha humbled the pride of a young Brahmin by pointing out that he was the descendant of
a slave.
119 [[MN93]] at MN II 149,17 and MN II 150,11 illustrates the two types of conduct by listing the ten courses
of action (kammapatha). Instead of describing the actual undertaking of these ten courses of action, T
71 speaks in each case of the corresponding mental state. Thus T 71 at T I 877a18+23 contrasts someone who “enjoys killing”,, with someone who has a “mind of not killing”,, etc. The topic
of the retribution for evil conduct comes up again in T 71 at T I 877c20.
120 [[MN93]] at MN II 151,6 and [[MA151]] at T I 664b14.
121 [[MN93]] at MN II 151,18 and [[MA151]] at T I 664b23.
122 T 71 at T I 877b9.
123 [[MA151]] presents this as two separate arguments, where the first point at T I 663a10 is that they can all
produce fire, while the second point at T I 663a21 is that the flame of their fires do not differ, corresponding to the argument in [[MN93]] at MN II 152,10. [[MN93]] at MN II 152,1 introduces this example by speaking of “a hundred men of different births”, nānājaccāna� purisāna� purisasata�, which has its counterpart in [[MA151]] at T I 664c9 in the expression “hundred types of people”,, an expression [[MA151]] at T I 664b22 also uses in relation to the argument about washing oneself. 憙殺 無殺心

not be obstructed by empty space. [125] The individual translation additionally points out
that members of any class will find employment in the king’s service and will also be
able to cross a river with the help of a boat. [126]

MN II 153   The three versions also take up the class of a child born from a couple of mixed class,
with one parent from the warrior class and the other parent from the Brahmin class. [127]
According to the Majjhima-nikāya and Madhyama-āgama accounts, Assalāyana indicated that the child could belong to either the father’s or the mother’s class; [128] in the individual translation, Assalāyana similarly admitted that he did not know to which class
the child would belong. [129] The three versions agree in illustrating this dilemma with the
example of a mule, which could not be reckoned to be a horse or a donkey. [130]

MN II 154   The Assalāyana-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel raise another argument that
involves Brahmin brothers. Assalāyana had to admit that a brother who is learned will

126 T 71 at T I 877b13 and T I 877b22. The second example brings to the mind the image of “crossing” the
stream, found frequently in the discourses.
127 While [[MN93]] at MN II 153,18 takes up the possibility that the child is like the mother or like the father,
[[MA151]] at T I 665a29 distinguishes between three possible cases, where the child might be like the father,
it might be like the mother, or else it might not be like any of the two, .
128 [[MA151]] at T I 665a21 relates this argument to the previous discussion on making a fire by highlighting
that class identity is simply the outcome of where one is born, just as different types of fire are simply
named after the type of fuel in dependence on which they burn. The image of different types of fire
reckoned in accordance to their fuel can also be found in [[MN38]] at MN I 259,24, where it serves to illustrate the dependent arising of consciousness.
129 T 71 at T I 877c9, where already at the onset of the discussion at T I 877a2 the Buddha had taken up the
example of children born from mixed parents of any of the four classes.
130 While [[MN93]] and [[MA151]] follow this exchange with the simile of the mule, T 71 has first the simile
and then the present exchange. The same dilemma, together with the mule simile, occurs also in [[EA49.6]] at T II 798b19 (parallel to [[MN92]]). According to [[EA49.6]] a child from a couple of mixed Brahmin 或似父, 或似母, 或不似父母
and warrior descent would invariably belong to the class of the father. Another instance of this dilemma
can be found in [[DN3]] at DN I 97,4, according to which a child from a Brahmin and warrior couple would
be acceptable to Brahmins, while the members of the warrior class would not give such a child consecration. Its parallel [[DA20]] at T I 83b6 similarly indicates that the warriors would not respect a child
from a Brahmin father and a warrior mother and not consider it as a rightful heir, while the Brahmins
would respect a child from a warrior father and a Brahmin mother and would consider it a rightful heir.
The different opinions proposed in these texts show that the Assalāyana-sutta’s inquiry after the class
of a child from parents of mixed class delves into a complex subject. According to Devi 1999: 50, “when
a male of a higher var�a marries a woman of a lower var�a, the marriage ... and the offspring is said to
be a�uloma (... in the natural order); when there is a union of a woman of a higher var�a with a male of
a lower var�a ... the children of the union are said to be pratiloma (... against the natural or proper order)”. Ibid. explains that while there were different opinions on whether an a�uloma child deserves to be
reckoned as a member of the father’s class, “the pratilomas ... are lower in status than any of the two
parents” (ibid. p. 54). Applied to the present dilemma, this suggests that a child born from a couple where
the father’s class is superior to the mother, the child might be reckoned the same class as its father or
else might only receive the inferior class status of its mother. A child from a father of inferior class,
however, would not seem to stand any chance of being reckoned a member of the higher class of its
mother.

be honoured by the Brahmins over an unlearned brother. [131] If, however, such an unlearned brother should be virtuous while the learned one is of evil conduct, then the
Brahmins will honour virtue over learning. In both versions, the Buddha highlighted
that by first agreeing to the superiority of learning and then to the superiority of moral
conduct, Assalāyana had accepted the very grounds based on which the Buddha proclaimed purification of all four classes. [132]
The Assalāyana-sutta concludes its examination of Assalāyana’s claims by narrating
a former meeting between the seer Asita Devala and seven Brahmin seers, a tale also
found in the partial parallel from the Ekottarika-āgama and in the discourse quotation
in Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya. [133] The individual trans

131 [[MA151]] at T I 666a29 differs from [[MN93]] in so far as it contrasts two learned brothers with two unlearned
brothers. T 71 at T I 877c13 has a related argument, although this involves a single child of bad conduct, not brothers.
132 While according to [[MN93]] at MN II 154,24 Assalāyana remained silent, showing signs of being defeated, [[MA151]] at T I 666b15 describes that, after hearing this argument, Assalāyana got up and paid respect to the Buddha. The assembled audience was thereupon struck by wonder and expressed their admiration for the Buddha’s might and power. [[MA151]] at T I 666a26 also describes that Assalāyana was
reduced to silence, which according to its account, however, happened after the tale of the seven Brahmin seers, a tale [[MA151]] has before the present argument. This placing is less apposite, as the tale of
the seven Brahmin seers fits more naturally after Assalāyana had been defeated, a placing given to it in
[[MN93]] and T 71. Assalāyana's paying respect and the surprised reaction of the audience, who then express their admiration for the Buddha in various terms, also do not fit too well into the narrative flow of
[[MA151]] According to [[MA151]] at T I 664a10, Assalāyana had come to the Buddha in the company of a
group of Brahmins that had asked him to defeat the Buddha. As there is no indication that, apart from
these Brahmins, others were also present, the audience of the discourse appears to consist of these Brahmins (judging from the flow of the narration, it would fit the situation well if these Brahmins had approached the Buddha in private, since Assalāyana’s premonition that he might be unable to defeat the
Buddha in debate would have alerted them to the possibility of being unsuccessful and hence would
have made it preferable to avoid challenging the Buddha in the presence of others, cf. also Ps II 284,13
for a similar type of reasoning in relation to another discourse that also records the Buddha being challenged). [[MA151]] at T I 666b28 reports that after the discussion with the Buddha these Brahmins blamed
Assalāyana for not having stood his ground, which makes it improbable that these same Brahmins would
earlier have praised the Buddha in the way described in [[MA151]] at T I 666b17. Perhaps the description
of Assalāyana’s paying of respect and the reaction of the audience to this behaviour made its way into
the present discourse from the account of a similar sequence of events involving the Brahmin Brahmāyu
in [[MA161]] at T I 689a13, in which case this description suits the context and is also found in the parallels [[MN91]] at MN II 144,28 and T 76 at T I 885c9.
133 [[EA40.9]] takes place at Sāvatthī and begins by reporting that King Pasenadi paid a visit to the Buddha.
On seeing several ascetics pass by, Pasenadi proclaimed that he held them to be arahants. In reply, the
Buddha explained that close examination was required in order to ascertain if someone was an arahant.
This introductory tale is similar to an exchange between the Buddha and Pasenadi recorded in [[SN3.11]]
at SN I 78,1 (or SN [2] 122 at SN [2] I 177,1). [[EA40.9]] at T II 742b17 then continues with the tale of the
seven Brahmin seers visited by Asita Devala. Similar to [[MN93]] Asita’s appearance angered the Brahmins so that they tried to curse him. Instead of turning into ashes, Asita became ever more handsome.
The reason for his visit in [[EA40.9]] however, is different, as the wrong view of the seven Brahmin seers
was that by undertaking asceticism they would be able to reach kingship on earth or in heaven. It is nota


MN II 155

lation and the Pāli commentary agree in identifying the seer Asita Devala with the Buddha in one of his former lives. [134] The Assalāyana-sutta and its parallels relate with minor variations how Asita Devala visited a group of Brahmin seers who were holding
the same view that Assalāyana had tried to defend in front of the Buddha. [135] The Brahmin
seers tried to curse Asita Devala, but instead of turning into ashes he became ever more
handsome. [136]

MN II 156   The Assalāyana-sutta, the individual translation, and the Tibetan version agree that
Asita Devala refuted the notion of class superiority of the Brahmin seers by getting
them to admit that they were not really sure of the purity of their descent through past
generations. According to the Madhyama-āgama parallel, however, the Brahmins felt
sure of the purity of their descent for up to seven generations. They were, however, unable to indicate to which class the being to be born belonged. [137] The individual translation explores this point in additional detail, indicating that, while the child is growing
in the womb, the parents are unable to know if it will be blind, deaf or dumb, if it is going to be hunchbacked or lame. [138] If they do not know even this much, how could they
claim to know that it has come from Brahmā’s mouth?

MN II 157   While the Majjhima-nikāya version concludes with Assalāyana taking refuge as a lay
disciple, according to the Madhyama-āgama discourse and the individual translation he
only paid his respect. [139] The Madhyama-āgama version continues by describing how
the other Brahmins blamed Assalāyana for having been worsted by the Buddha instead
of successfully defending their claim to class superiority. [140]

ble how [[EA40.9]] combines elements of [[MN93]] with material found in a different discourse in the Pāli
Nikāyas; for other instance where an Ekottarika-āgama discourse combines material found in the Pāli
canon in different discourses cf. above pp. 472-473 notes 159 and 165, as well as p. 546 note 89).
134 T 71 at T I 878a5 and Ps III 411,7. Horner 1957/1970: 347 note 2 and Malalasekera 1937/1995: 210
suggest that Asita Devala may be identical with Kāla Devala in Jā 423 at Jā III 463,16. Such an identification would, however, not agree with the suggestion by the Pāli commentary and the individual translation that Asita Devala was a former birth of the Buddha, as Kāla Devala was one of the students of
Sarabha�ga, a former life of the Buddha, so that the identification proposed by Horner and Malalasekera would result in a co-existence of two former lives of the Buddha. On Asita Devala cf. also Windisch 1916: 6-13.
135 [[MN93]] at MN II 154,29 speaks of seven Brahmin seers, brāhma�isayo, [[EA40.9]] at T II 742b18 and T
71 at T I 878a2 speak just of “seven Brahmins”, or, [[MA151]] at T I 665b26 speaks of
“numerous seers”,, as does D (4094) mngon pa, ju 110a5 or Q (5595) tu 126a4: drang srong
rab tu mang po dag.
136 [[EA40.9]] at T II 742b29 explains that this happened because he overcame their anger through mettā.
137 [[MA151]] at T I 666a13 adds that Asita also asked if the seers knew the sex of the being to be born, and
what direction it came from; the additional argument about the direction from which the gandhabba
comes is also found in D (4094) mngon pa, ju 111a7 or Q (5595) tu 127b2. On the gandhabba cf. also
above p. 254 note 243.
138 T 71 at T I 878b8.
139 [[MA151]] at T I 666b28 and T 71 at T I 878b27.
140 According to [[MA151]] at T I 666c2, to illustrate Assalāyana’s defeat the Brahmins used the same two 七梵志 七婆羅門
similes employed in [[MA133]] at T I 631c 眾多仙人 10 to illustrate how the householder Upāli had been unable to
stand his ground in debate with the Buddha.


Chapter 10 Brāhma�a-vagga                                   -  557


[[MN94]] Gho�amukha-sutta

The Gho�amukha-sutta, the “discourse to Gho�amukha”, records a discussion between the monk Udena and the Brahmin Gho�amukha. Of this discourse, so far no parallel seems to have been identified. [141]
The concluding section of the Gho�amukha-sutta indicates that the Buddha had already passed away by the time of this discourse, followed by recording the building of
an assembly hall by the Brahmin Gho�amukha in order to express his appreciation for
the instruction he had received from Udena. [142] As the construction of such a hall will
take some time, a remark on the successful completion of the construction work must
be considerably later than the Buddha’s passing away, and thus posterior to the communal recitation of the discourses at the so-called first council that according to the
traditional account took place at Rājagaha soon after the Buddha’s demise. [143]


[[MN95]] Ca�kī-sutta

The Ca�kī-sutta, the “discourse [spoken in the presence of] Ca�kī”, explains how to
preserve and arrive at truth. This discourse does not have a parallel in the Chinese Āgamas. Considerable parts of this discourse have, however, been preserved in Sanskrit
fragments, which stem from two different versions of this discourse. One of these two
versions was probably referred to as the Kāma�hika-sūtra, thereby taking as its title the
name of the main protagonist of the discourse, the Brahmin youth Kāma�hika, [144] or
Kāpa�hika in the Pāli version. [145] The other Sanskrit version has the title Ca�gī-sūtra


141 Sanskrit fragment SHT V 1476R3-5 (p. 228) reports that a Brahmin, on being informed that the Buddha
had passed away, expressed his willingness to travel a considerable distance to meet the Buddha if the
latter had still been alive, similar to [[MN84]] at MN II 90,16 and [[MN94]] at MN II 162,24. The Sanskrit
discourse takes place near Kauśāmbī and has views as its subject, while [[MN84]] takes place in Madhurā
and [[MN94]] near Vārā�asī. The respective subject matter also differs, as [[MN84]] reports the Brahmin’s
claim to class superiority and [[MN94]] examines four types of person who torment themselves, torment
others, torment both, or torment neither. Hence this Sanskrit fragment would not be a parallel to [[MN84]]
or to [[MN94]] cf. also the fragments mentioned above p. 309 note 2.
142 [[MN94]] at MN II 163,25; cf. also Franke 1915: 163 and Pande 1957: 137.
143 On the first council or perhaps better “rehearsal” cf. also below p. 863.
144 The fragments are SHT III 883a (pp. 132-133), SHT IV 165 folios 29-31+42 (p. 203-205, cf. also SHT
VII p. 241 and SHT IX p. 379, which also identifies folio 42), SHT V 1025A (p. 9, identified in SHT
VII p. 274), and Pelliot fragment bleu 18,2, no. 17 in Hartmann 1991: 90-92. SHT IV 165 folio 29 and
SHT V 1025A4-5 correspond to the beginning of the discourse at MN II 164 and to the reasons for visiting the Buddha at MN II 166-167. SHT IV 165 folio 31A concludes the exposition of these reasons.
SHT IV 165 folio 30B parallels the Buddha’s request to the young Brahmin that he should not interrupt
the conversation the Buddha was having with other Brahmins, found at MN II 168,24. SHT III 883a
and Pelliot fragment bleu 18,2 parallel the Buddha’s examination of the Brahminical claim to truth at
MN II 169-170. SHT III 883a also has parts of the Buddha’s exposition on how to protect truth at MN
II 171. The uddāna in fragment 299V3 in Hartmann 2000: 363 has preserved ma�hika�, suggesting that
the discourse was entitled after its protagonist Kāma�hika.

and thereby agrees with the Pāli Ca�kī-sutta on taking as its title the name of the Brahmin who makes his appearance during the beginning part of the discourse and who is
also present in the assembly that witnessed the discussion between the Buddha and Kāpa�hika. [146] The Ca�gī-sūtra has some linguistic features that resemble the Mahāvastu. [147]

MN II 164  The Ca�kī-sutta of the Majjhima-nikāya begins by describing that the Brahmin Ca�kī intended to visit the Buddha, who had come to stay in a nearby grove. Other Brahmins objected that it would be beneath Ca�kī’s dignity to go and visit the Buddha.
Ca�kī remained firm in his decision, however, giving various reasons why it was proper for him to visit the Buddha.

MN II 166  Compared to the Pāli version, the Sanskrit fragments present several additional reasons why the Brahmin felt it was appropriate for him to visit the Buddha. According to
the Kāma�hika-sūtra, additional reasons for approaching the Buddha were:

       - he had gone beyond future rebirth,

       - he taught a doctrine good in its beginning, middle, and end. [148]
According to the Ca�gī-sūtra, additional reasons that made it appropriate to visit the
Buddha were:

       - he dwelled in secluded places,

       - he had reached peaceful concentrative attainments,

       - he was superior to others in his wisdom,

       - he was endowed with unsurpassable knowledge and conduct. [149]
Another quality extolled in the Ca�gī-sūtra is that the Buddha receives exquisite
food. [150] The Ca�gī-sūtra also proclaims that, in whatever location the Buddha arrives,
humans will be protected from being harmed by demons. [151]


MN II 598,3 reads Kāpadika. SHT IV 165 folio 30B2 reads Kāva�ika, while fragment 3V4+5 and fragment 4R3 in Hartmann 2002b: 4 read Kama�hika, with Kama�hika found in fragment 3V3.
146 Fragments of this discourse have been published by Brekke 2000: 55-61 and Hartmann 2002b: 3-16; cf.
also Braarvig 2010: 2-5.
147 Brekke 2000: 54-55.

150 Fragment 2R2-3 in Hartmann 2002b: 3: sa hi bhavā� gau[ta]ma� lābhī pra�ī[t]ānā� khādanīyabhojanīyānā�. The inclusion of this as a praiseworthy quality of the Buddha brings to mind the parallel to
the Mahāgovinda-sutta found in the Mahāvastu, which similarly takes up the exquisite nature of the
food the Buddha received, cf. Basak 1968/2004: 122,10 or Senart 1897: 201,3: labhī ... bhagavā� ...
pra�ītānā� khādanīya-bhojanīyānā�. The Pāli and Chinese counterparts to this passage only mention
the Buddha’s attitude towards food, without taking the nature of the food he receives into consideration, cf. [[DN19]] at DN II 223,26, which just mentions that the Buddha took food without being intoxicated by it, vigata mado ... āhāra� āhāreti, while T 8 at T I 208c7 speaks of the absence of any conceit,
(another parallel, [[DA3]] at T I 30b-34b, does not seem to cover this quality at all).
The present passage in the Mahāvastu in Basak 1968/2004: 122,13 or in Senart 1897: 201,6 also refers
to the absence of any intoxication, vigatamado āhāram āharati, in addition to its description of the exquisiteness of the food received by the Buddha.

Chapter 10 Brāhma�a-vagga                                   -  559


Before turning to Ca�kī’s visit to the Buddha, [152] the Ca�gī-sūtra describes the reaction of the other Brahmins to Ca�kī’s praises of the Buddha in further detail. According to its account, the other Brahmins came to the conclusion that just one of the qualities
mentioned by Ca�kī would be sufficient to visit the Buddha, even if the Buddha were
to stay at a considerable distance. [153]


151 Fragment 2R6 Hartmann 2002b: 3: sa hi bhavā� gautama� ya� grāma� vā nnāga[ra� v](ā u)paniśrāya viha(rati na) tat[r]a [a]manu�(y)ā manu[�y]ā� vihe�henti. This way of highlighting the Buddha’s
protective powers again brings to mind the Mahāvastu, which dwells at considerable length on this subject in its description of the Buddha’s arrival at Vaiśāli. According to the Mahāvastu, not only did the
Buddha’s arrival cause all demons to leave the town, thereby putting an end to a plague, but in several
former existences as a hermit, an elephant, and a bull, his presence had the same effect on demons, cf.
Basak 1963a: 361,7 or Senart 1882a: 283,7. To describe the protection against non-human beings afforded
by the Buddha’s presence is, however, not exclusive to the Mahāvastu, since such a description also occurs in [[DN4]] at DN I 116,14: sama�o khalu, bho, gotamo yasmi� gāme vā nigame vā pa�ivasati, na
tasmi� gāme vā nigame vā amanussā manusse vihe�henti, a statement found also in its Sanskrit counterpart folio 398R1 in Hartmann 2002b: 8: bha[vā]� (g)[au](tamo) [y]a� grāmak�etra� upaniś�tya viharati na tatrāmanu�yā manu�yā� vihe�hayanti, and in its Chinese counterpart [[DA22]] at T I 95b12: “at
a location reached by the recluse Gotama, non-humans and spirits do not dare to make trouble”,
. Skilling 1992a: 111 notes that “a similar statement is made in
the Mahāsāhasrapramardanī, and a similar idea occurs in the Mūlasarvāstivādin Vinayavibha�ga in
Tibetan and Chinese translation”. Nevertheless, when considered together with the reference to exquisite food, this emphasis on the protective aura caused by the Buddha’s presence may reflect some degree of affinity between the Ca�gī-sūtra and the Mahāvastu, in addition to their linguistic similarities.
152 According to [[MN95]] at MN II 164,5, the Buddha was staying in a grove of sāla-trees (shorea robusta)
called “grove of devas”, devavane sālavane, located north of the village Opasāda. The commentary Ps
III 414,16 explains that this grove was called devavana because religious offerings were made in it to
devas, devatāna� balikamma� karīyati. Ca�gī-sūtra fragment 3R5 in Hartmann 2002b: 4 also speaks
of a grove of devas, devā�mravana. SHT IV 165 folio 29Rb of the Kāma�hika-sūtra refers instead to a 沙門
瞿曇所至之處, śiśapāvana, similarly located north of the village, 非人, 鬼神, 不敢觸嬈 uttare�a grāmasya. A si�sapāvana or śi�śapāvana
recurs in the Mahāparinirvā�a-sūtra in fragment [[SN360]] folios 164R4, 170R3, and 178V5+R1 in Waldschmidt 1950: 14, 17, and 21, in [[DN23]] at DN II 316,8, in [[SN56.31]] at SN V 437,20, and in [[AN3.34]] at
AN I 136,19. Although the Mahāparinirvā�a-sūtra indicates the śi�śapāvana to be invariably found
“north of the village”, uttare�a grāmasya, the actual locations of the grove differ. [[DN23]] [[SN56.31]]
and [[AN3.34]] also associate the si�sapāvana with different locations. These variations suggest that references to a si�sapāvana or śi�śapāvana, a grove with Indian Rosewood trees (dalbergia sissoo) north
of a village, could be just a standard pericope, cf. also von Simson 1965: 72 and Legittimo 2004: 46.
[[MN95]] locates this particular grove near the village Opasāda, to which SHT IV 165 folio 29Vc and SHT
V 1025 [[AN5]] refer as Upasālā, while fragment 2V3 and fragment 3R1+5 in Hartmann 2002b: 3-4 speak of
Upaśaya.
153 Fragment 2V5-6 and fragment 3R1 in Hartmann 2002b: 3-4: ekinā pi a�gena sa�vi(d)[ya]ti arhāma ...
gauta[m]a� darśanāye upasa�kkramitu� paryupāsanāya sace so bhavā� gautama� ito syā ekasmi ...
yojanaśate pi. In [[MN95]] at MN II 168,6, Ca�kī himself makes the statement that even one of these qualities would suffice for making it appropriate to visit the Buddha, ekamekena pi ... a�gena samannāgato
... mayam eva arahāma ... gotama� dassanāya upasa�kamitu� (B [e] -MN II 380,10 and S [e] -MN II 597,16:
upasa�kamitun ti), although he does not refer to the distance at which the Buddha might dwell. A passage similar to the Ca�gī-sūtra can be found in the Kū�atā��ya-sūtra, Sanskrit fragment 402v3 in von
Criegern 2002: 40, where the Pāli version, [[DN5]] at DN I 133,25, does not have such a statement.


560   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


MN II 168  The Pāli version and its Sanskrit fragment parallels report that during the ensuing
discussion between the Buddha and some senior Brahmins, the Brahmin youth Kāpa�hika broke in and interrupted their conversation. When the Buddha rebuked Kāpa�hika
for this, Ca�kī intervened on behalf of Kāpa�hika, declaring that the young Brahmin was
wise and capable of taking part in the discussion.

MN II 169   Kāpa�hika then confronted the Buddha with the claim that the Brahminical oral tradition preserves the only truth. According to the Ca�kī-sutta and the Kāma�hika-sūtra,
the Buddha unveiled the weak foundation of this claim by inquiring whether the former
sages, held to be the founders of this tradition, had personal realization of the truth. [154]
While in the Pāli account the point at stake was whether the former Brahminical teachers could claim to “know” and “see” the truth, [155] according to the Kāma�hika-sūtra the
point at issue was personal and direct realization of five qualities. [156]

MN II 170  According to the Sanskrit fragments, Kāpa�hika remained silent in reply to the Buddha’s query. In the Pāli version, however, Kāpa�hika admitted that those former sages
had not claimed to have such personal realization. [157] The Ca�kī-sutta and the Kāma�hika-sūtra continue with the simile of the blind men. [158] Kāpa�hika replied by declaring
that his truth claim was not only based on faith, but also on oral tradition.
According to the Ca�kī-sutta, in reply to this declaration by Kāpa�hika the Buddha
examined the limitations of five sources of knowledge:

       - faith,

       - liking,

       - oral tradition,


154 Although this exchange has not been preserved in its entirety in the Sanskrit fragments, Pelliot fragment bleu 18,2Vd+Rc, no. 17 in Hartmann 1991: 91, has preserved references to (Vāma)devo, Viśvāmitro, Jamada[gnir], and [A]�[g](iraso), while SHT III 883aV5 refers to (A)[��a]ko, Vāmako, Vāmadevo, and Viśvā(mitro), pointing to a similar list of ancient Indian sages as found in [[MN95]] at MN II
169,29.
155 [[MN95]] at MN II 169,17: aham eta� jānāmi, aham eta� passāmi, idam eva sacca� mogham aññan ti.

e�ā� pa�cānā� dharmā�ā� sva[y], although unfortunately the fragment has not preserved the part that
indicates what are these five qualities. Hartmann 1991: 91 draws attention to a similar formulation found
in [[MN99]] at MN II 199,30, where the question at stake is whether former Brahminical teachers could
claim to have personal and direct realization of the fruits of truth, asceticism, celibacy, study, and generosity.
157 Pelliot fragment bleu 18,2Re, no. 17 in Hartmann 1991: 91: (tū��)ī[m](bhū)to madg[u]bhūta(�) and
SHT III 883aV8: (sra)staskandha� adhomu[kho] ni[�](p)[r](atibhāna�).
158 SHT III 883aR1 has preserved a reference to the blind men, andhāve�yu[pa]mān[o]. This simile has a
counterpart in the Ka�ha Upani�ad 1.2.5, which illustrates the predicament of ignorant fools who deem
themselves wise with the image of “blind men led by one who is himself blind” (translated by Radhakrishnan 1953/1992: 609), andhenaiva nīyamānā yathāndhā�. Horsch 1961: 1406 comments that this
parallelism need not imply a direct relationship between early Buddhism and the Upani�ads, as the
image of the blind led by a blind would have been part of ancient Indian lore in general. Another instance of this image can be found in the Jain Sūyaga�[[AN1.1]].2.19 in Bollée 1977b: 18,11, translated ibid.
p. 95, who (p. 96) mentions another occurrence in Mahābhārata 2.38.3.

 - examination-and-reasoning,

 - intuitive acceptance of a view. [159]
The Ca�gī-sūtra fragments, however, instead take up truth claims based on what is
seen, heard, sensed, and cognised. [160] According to the Ca�gī-sūtra, when truth claims
are made based on what is seen, heard, etc., but without having reached personal realization, [161] then they can lead to dogmatic adherence to an oral tradition. [162]
The Pāli and Sanskrit versions agree that to protect truth one should not make dogmatic claims based on any of the sources of knowledge listed in their respective presentations. [163] The Ca�kī-sutta and its parallels proceed from protection of truth to discovery of truth (saccānubodha or satyānubodha).
The Pāli version introduces discovery of truth by describing a householder who investigates if a monk shows signs of being under the influence of greed, anger, or delusion. In the Sanskrit fragment versions, however, the object of a similar investigation
appears to be the Buddha himself. [164]

159 [[MN95]] at MN II 170,27: saddhā, ruci, anussava, ākāraparivitakka, di��hinijjhānakkhanti. SHT III 883a
R4 has preserved a reference to (svākā)raparivitarkita�, followed by sud���iniddhyā, so that this version may have had a similar exchange.
160 Hartmann 2002b: 11 remarks that although “the structure of the present passage is partly obscured ... it
becomes clear that only four factors, d���a�, śruta�, hvuta�/hmuta�, vijñāta� are listed here”. Other
Pāli discourses similarly indicate that what is seen, heard, sensed, and cognised should not be taken up
in a dogmatic manner. Thus, [[MN1]] at MN I 3,15 warns against conceivings in regard to these four; [[MN22]] at MN I 135,34 presents these four as instances for identification and the genesis of views; [[MN112]]
at MN III 30,8 indicates that an arahant is thoroughly detached from these four; [[MN143]] at MN III 261,10
advises not to hold on to these four when one is about to pass away; and according to [[SNP5.9]] at [[SNP1086]]
freedom from attachment to di��ha suta, muta, and viññāta leads to Nirvā�a. On di��ha suta, muta, and
viññāta cf. also Bapat 1950: 93-94, Bhattacharya 1980, Jayatilleke 1963/1980: 60-61, Jayawickrama

that here it is the Tathāgata who lives in dependence on some village and then becomes the object of
the householder’s investigation. Fragment 326V6 of the Kāma�hika-sūtra in Hartmann 2002b: 13 also
refers to the arising of a Tathāgata. The arising of a Tathāgata and the description of how a householder
investigates the Tathāgata concerning the presence of greed, anger, or delusion recur also in fragments
of the Pi�galātreya-sūtra, fragment 367v5-6 in Peipina 2008: 41, reading: śāstus t��u sthāne�u viśuddhi� samanve�ate tadyathā lobhadha(r)[me] dve�adharme mohadharme, and in the Śrāma�yaphalasūtra found in the Sa�ghabhedavastu, Gnoli 1978a: 230,16, which also combines these two elements
by describing how a householder goes forth to undertake the gradual path after having in the above

562   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


This investigation is concerned with ascertaining if this person might claim to know
what he does not know and teach what will be to the detriment of those who follow his
instructions. The Pāli and Sanskrit versions agree in qualifying the teachings given by
this person to be profound and sublime, [165] qualifications other Pāli discourses associate
with the Buddha’s exposition of the Dharma. [166]

MN II 173   The Ca�kī-sutta and its parallels describe in similar terms how, based on such investigation, the householder places confidence, learns, and practises the teachings, until he
reaches personal realization of the truth. [167] In regard to the series of steps that lead from
initial confidence to personal realization of the truth, the Ca�gī-sūtra adds that after
having heard the teachings and before being able to bear them in mind, they need to be
learned. [168] The Ca�gī-sūtra also presents a transitional step between intuitive acceptance of the teachings and the arising of the desire (to practise), which is the arising of


manner investigated the Tathāgata. The same is, however, not found in the Pāli and Chinese versions of
the same discourse, cf. [[DN2]] at DN I 62,24, [[DA27]] at T I 109b7 (to be supplemented from T I 83c3),
and T 22 at T I 272b28 (another parallel, [[EA42.7]] at T II 764a13, does not have the gradual path account at all). In the case of [[MN95]] if the Pāli version were to be emended in accordance with the Sanskrit fragment, [[MN95]] at MN II 171,31 would simply read aññatara� gāma� vā nigama� vā upanissāya viharati, without specifying bhikkhu to be the subject of this sentence. That is, the difference between the Pāli and the Sanskrit versions revolves around the occurrence of the subject bhikkhu in the
Pāli sentence. The sentence found in [[MN95]] at MN II 171,31 occurs also in [[MN55]] at MN I 369,11:
bhikkhu aññatara� gāma� vā nigama� vā upanissāya viharati, where this sentence is similarly followed by examining the relationship of this monk to a lay supporter. The similarity between these two
discourses is also highlighted in the commentary at Ps III 426,11, which refers to [[MN55]] in its gloss on
the present passage in [[MN95]] Due to this affinity between the two discourses, it could easily have happened that, during the transmission of the Majjhima-nikāya collection, the subject bhikkhu accidentally
made its way from [[MN55]] into the present passage in [[MN95]] A problem with this hypothesis, however, is that in [[MN95]] this sentence is not preceded by a reference to the arising of a Tathāgata, so that,
without the subject bhikkhu, the sentence would not only be without an explicit subject, but also without an implicit subject.

166 The same set of qualifications recurs in [[MN26]] at MN I 167,31, [[MN72]] at MN I 487,5, [[MN85]] at MN II
93,25, [[SN6.1]] at SN I 136,9 (or SN [2] 172 at SN [2] I 298,9), and Vin I 4,33 in relation to the teachings of the
Buddha Gotama, and in [[DN14]] at DN II 36,2 in relation to the teachings of the Buddha Vipassī .
167 A to some extent comparable series of steps can be found in the Jain Viyāhapa��atti 2.37-46 in Lalwani 1973b: 199,29.
168 Fragment 6V1 in Hartmann 2002b: 6: ś��vanta� dharmma� paryyāpu�ati, dharmma� paryyāpu�[a�],
the corresponding statement in [[MN95]] at MN II 173,20 just reads sutvā dhamma� dhāreti. The Kāma�hika-sūtra agrees in this respect with the Pāli presentation, cf. fragment 327V6 in Hartmann 2002b:
15: śruta� dharman dhārayati. In other Pāli discourses, pariyāpu�āti and dhāreti occur in a triad of
near synonyms, cf., e.g., [[DN32]] at DN III 206,14 or [[MN89]] at MN II 124,30, so that the difference between [[MN95]] and the Ca�gī-sūtra do not seem to involve a substantially different conception of the
steps required for coming to a personal realization of the truth.


Chapter 10 Brāhma�a-vagga                                   -  563


joy. [169] The role of joy as an important factor for the path to realization is a recurrent
theme in the Pāli discourses. [170]
The final part of the Ca�kī-sutta describes arrival at truth through repeated development of the same factors and records that Kāpa�hika became a lay disciple of the Buddha. The Kāma�hika-sūtra fragment instead reports that the Buddha gave a gradual
teaching to the Brahmin Ca�kī (Cā�gī), leading up to a disclosure of the four noble
truths. [171] Hearing this teaching, the Brahmin attained stream-entry, [172] took refuge, and
invited the Buddha and his monks for a meal the next day. According to the Kāma�hika-sūtra fragment, once the preparations were completed, the meal offering took place,
at the conclusion of which the Buddha spoke a set of verses. [173]


[[MN96]] Esukāri-sutta

The Esukāri-sutta, the “discourse to Esukārī”, records a conversation between the Buddha and the Brahmin Esukārī. This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama. [174]
The Esukāri-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel begin with a Brahmin proclaiming in front of the Buddha that the members of any class should serve those of a higher
class, with the Brahminical class being the one that should be served by all other classes. [175]
In reply to this proclamation, according to the Majjhima-nikāya version the Buddha
asked the Brahmin Esukārī if the whole world had authorized the Brahmins to establish

169 Fragment 6V1-2 Hartmann 2002b: 6: dharmmanidhyāna� k�a�at(i) ... (prāmodya�) [j]āyati, pramuditasya cchanda� jāyati, [[MN95]] at MN II 173,22, however, directly proceeds to the desire (to practise),
dhammanijjhānakkhantiyā sati chando jāyati. The Kāma�hika-sūtra fragment 327V6 in Hartmann
2002b: 15 proceeds differently, since from memorizing the teachings it continues via thinking and examining to investigating, dh�ta� dharma� cintayati, cintayitvā tulayati, tulayitvā upaparīk�ate.
170 E.g., [[AN10.2]] at AN V 2,25 indicates that the presence of joy, pāmojja, naturally leads to the arising of
happiness, concentration, and realization. [[SN12.23]] at SN II 32,3 compares this natural sequence to rain
that falls on a hill top and in due course fills the rivers and flows into the sea.
171 DĀ (Skt) fragment 328r4. This final part of the Kāma�hika-sūtra fragments is no longer part of the material published in Hartmann 2002b (I am indebted to Jens-Uwe Hartmann for kindly providing me
with a preliminary draft transliteration of this section of the fragment).
172 DĀ (Skt) fragment 328r7 reports that the Brahmin Cā�gī attained insight into the four noble truths,
saw the Dharma, and went beyond doubt, indications corresponding to the standard description of
stream-entry in the early discourses.
173 DĀ (Skt) fragment 328v8, which begins with a reference to agnihotramukhā yajñā; for a study of a
range of occurrences of this stanza cf. Skilling 2003; on a rendering of this stanza in the Chinese Dīrgha-āgama cf. Meisig 2010: 72.
174 The parallel is [[MA150]] at T I 660c-663b. While [[MN96]] takes place in Jeta’s Grove near Sāvatthī, [[MA150]] has the Bamboo Grove by Rājagaha as its location. The two versions agree on taking the name of
the Buddha’s visitor, Esukārī/, as their title.
175 Bucknell 2007: 21 note 59 points out that in [[MN96]] at MN II 177,22 (the same holds true for [[MA150]]
at T I 661a7) the listing of classes begins with the Brahmins, followed by the warrior class, whereas
elsewhere in the discourses such listings begin with the warrior class. This departure from the usual sequence reflects the circumstance that the listing is presented as being spoken by a Brahmin, who naturally puts his own class in first position.

who should serve whom. [176] According to the Madhyama-āgama version, however, the
Buddha asked if this proposition was based on personal knowledge of the Brahmins. [177]
In both versions, the Brahmin had to answer in the negative, which caused the Buddha
to compare the Brahminical prescription on the service to be rendered among the members of the four classes to forcing a poor person to eat meat and also ask him to pay for it. [178]

MN II 178  According to the Majjhima-nikāya version, the appropriateness of giving service
should be evaluated based on whether such service results in bettering or worsening the
server’s condition, in the sense of whether faith, virtue, learning, generosity, and wisdom will increase or decrease due to such service. The parallel version similarly reports that the Buddha made the Brahmin acknowledge that the point at stake was whether
these five qualities increase or decrease through rendering service, although in the Madhyama-āgama account this takes place through a series of questions and answers. [179]
The Majjhima-nikāya version also explores the need to avoid generalizations by pointing out that unwholesome conduct happens even when someone has a high social position or is endowed with great beauty and wealth. This line of reasoning, which is not
found in the Madhyama-āgama discourse, highlights that sweeping proposals, like the
declaration made by Esukārī, do not take into account individual differences.

MN II 180  The Esukāri-sutta and its parallel agree that the Brahmin Esukārī came out with another proposition, in which he described the type of wealth characteristic of each of the
four classes. The two versions agree on three of these types of wealth:

       - begging is a Brahmin’s wealth,

       - a bow is a warrior’s wealth,

       - farming is the wealth of a merchant. [180]


176 [[MN96]] at MN II 178,15: “how is it ... has the whole world agreed to the Brahmins setting forth these
four types of service”, ki� pana ... sabbo loko brāhma�āna� etad abbhanujānāti, imā catasso pāricariyā paññāpentū ti (C [e] -MN II 668,21: paññāpentī ti)?
177 [[MA150]] at T I 661a18: “do the Brahmins know by themselves these four types of class and what respectful behaviour to designate for these four classes”, ? When
evaluating the difference between the two versions, it seems that the issue at stake is social convention.
Thus, the suggestion in [[MN96]] that a general consensus would be needed to set up such conventions
seems quite appropriate. In contrast, the proposal in [[MA150]] that to determine the type of service to be
rendered among members of the different classes requires personal knowledge seems less straightforward, as one might wonder what kind of personal knowledge would enable setting out such conventions.
178 The instruction given to this man in [[MA150]] at T I 661a26 actually enjoins that “[you] can eat, [but
you] should give me ‘straight’”, . The Madhyama-āgama edition p. 1285 note 4
suggests the occurrence of to be an error for, “price”, facilitated by the fact that both characters
have the same pronunciation, in which case the reading found in the Indic original used for the translation of the Madhyama-āgama would have been similar in meaning to the Pāli version. Another differ- 諸梵志頗自知為四種姓, 施設四種奉事
ence is that [[MA150]] does not specify that the person who is given the meat is poor. The specification
that the man is poor recurs in another instance of this image in [[AN6.57]] at AN III 384,10.
179 [[MA150]] at T I 661c20. As its fourth quality, [[MA150]] lists . This should be the counterpart to cāga
in the Pāli version, although another discourse in the same collection, [[MA152]] at T I 669b18, has the
more straightforward as its counterpart to a reference to cāga in [[MN99]] at MN II 199,19.
180 While [[MN96]] at MN II 180,21 associates the merchant class to farming and cattle raising, kasigorak可食, 當與我直 佛光

Chapter 10 Brāhma�a-vagga                                   -  565


In regard to the fourth class, according to the Majjhima-nikāya version the sickle and
the carrying-pole are a worker’s characteristic type of wealth. [181] The Madhyama-āgama parallel instead speaks of “hemp” as the wealth of a worker. [182]
The Esukāri-sutta reports the Brahmin’s proclamation that those who despise their respective type of ‘wealth’ fail their duty, comparable to a watchman who commits theft. [183]
The commentary explains that a watchman does not do his duty if he steals the goods
he should be protecting. [184]
The Madhyama-āgama account instead illustrates this case with the example of a
cowherd who does not look after his cows, indicating that to spurn the traditional duties of one’s own class is comparable to a cowherd who does not fulfil the task for
which he has been employed. [185] In both versions, this proposition receives the same reply as the earlier proposition about service, followed by illustrating the vanity of such
proclamations with the same simile about forcing someone to eat meat and demanding
payment for it.
According to the Majjhima-nikāya discourse, in reply to Esukārī’s description of the
wealth of the four classes the Buddha declared the “noble supramundane Dharma” to
be a person’s own wealth, [186] while according to the Madhyama-āgama discourse he
proclaimed a person’s own wealth to be the “Dharma of appeasement”, the “Dharma of
complete cessation”, the “Dharma of the path to awakening” and the “well-gone Dharma”. [187] Although differing in formulation, both versions would have the same type of
‘wealth’ in mind.
The Majjhima-nikāya discourse explains class to be merely the conditioned outcome
of one’s place of birth, similar to different types of fire that are reckoned according to
the fuel in dependence on which they burn. The same version continues by declaring
that anyone who goes forth under the Tathāgata and refrains from the ten unwholesome
courses of action, to whatever class he may belong to, is “accomplished in the method

kha, [[MA150]] at T I 662b14 only mentions farming, . As Rhys Davids 1922: 203 points out, for
assessing the economic situation in ancient India it is significant that this passage sees the pursuit of
agriculture as unfit for Brahmins.

, thereby setting a contrast to the Brahminical proposition, which was not based on
personal knowledge.

of the wholesome Dharma”. [188] This indication is not made in the Madhyama-āgama
version.

MN II 182  The Esukāri-sutta and its parallel continue with various arguments against the Brahminical claim to class superiority, such as the ability of all four classes to practise loving kindness, to wash themselves, or to kindle a fire, similar to the arguments raised in
the Assalāyana-sutta and its parallel. [189] Both versions conclude with the Brahmin Esukārī taking refuge.


[[MN97]] Dhānañjāni-sutta [190]

The Dhānañjāni-sutta, the “discourse to Dhānañjāni”, records Sāriputta’s instructions to the Brahmin Dhānañjāni. This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama. [191]

MN II 185  The Dhānañjāni-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel begin by describing that a
monk, who had just come from Rājagaha, visited Sāriputta. [192] According to the Dhānañjāni-sutta, Sāriputta asked the monk about the welfare of the Buddha, of other monks
and of the Brahmin Dhānañjāni.
The Madhyama-āgama parallel reports that Sāriputta also inquired about the wellbeing of the nuns and the laity. He, moreover, not only wanted to know if they were
keeping well, but also if they were eager to see the Buddha and delighted in hearing the

188 [[MN96]] at MN II 181,34: ārādhako hoti ñāya� dhamma� kusala�. Although this part is not found in
[[MA150]] a counterpart to an occurrence of the same expression in [[MN99]] at MN II 197,6 can be found
in its parallel [[MA152]] at T I 667a19, which speaks of “reaching proper understanding and therefore
knowing in accordance with the Dharma”, . The “method”, ñāya, occurs also in the
standard recollection of the Sa�gha, which qualifies the noble disciple to be practising the “method”,
ñāya, e.g., in [[AN3.70]] at AN I 208,23, an expression that appears to have its counterpart in, “to
practice [what is] essential”, in its parallel [[MA202]] at T I 771c4. To attain this “method”, ñāya, is according to [[DN22]] at DN II 290,10 and [[MN10]] at MN I 56,2 one of the fruits of satipa��hāna practice. In
this case, the Chinese parallels speak in their corresponding sections of attaining “the right dharma”,
[[MA98]] at T I 582b10:, or of attaining “great wisdom”, [[EA12.1]] at T II 568a3: .
189 Cf. above p. 549. [[MA150]] at T I 662c13 begins this series of arguments by bringing up the question if
only Brahmins will not be obstructed by empty space, found also in [[MA151]] at T I 664b1.
190 Be-MN II 395,16, Ce-MN II 680,1, and Se-MN II 623,1: Dhanañjāni-sutta, a spelling of the name of the
protagonist found throughout in these three editions. 得善解, 則知如法
191 The parallel is [[MA27]] at T I 456a-458b and agrees with [[MN97]] on locating the discourse in the Squirrels’ Feeding Ground by Rājagaha. [[MA27]] agrees with [[MN97]] on using the name of its Brahmin pro- 行要
tagonist as its title, given in the form, with the additional specification that he was a Brahmin,
. Comments on [[MA27]] can be found in Minh Chau 1964/1991: 37, 73-74, 102, and 207.
192 While [[MN97]] at MN II 184,28 notes that Sāriputta was in the company of a great number of monks,
[[MA27]] at T I 456a25 reports the Buddha to have been in the company of a large group of monks. An- 得正法 得大智慧
other minor difference is that Sāriputta initiated the conversation by asking the monk where he came
from, [[MA27]] at T I 456b2. This seems a reasonable beginning of their conversation, as due to the presumably itinerant life style of the early generations of Buddhist monks it would have been difficult to
know where a newly arrived monk had just come from, making it only natural to begin a conversation
with such a question.

Dharma. [193] According to the Madhyama-āgama discourse, Sāriputta also indicated that
Dhānañjāni was an old friend of his from the time before he had gone forth. [194] This
would explain Sāriputta’s concern for Dhānañjāni, a concern evident in both discourses.
In the Madhyama-āgama version Sāriputta inquires after Dhānañjāni in the same manner as he had inquired after the monks, the nuns, and the laity. The Majjhima-nikāya
presentation, however, gives the impression that Sāriputta is already aware of the fact
that something might be going wrong, since in addition to inquiring if Dhānañjāni was
well, he also wants to know if Dhānañjāni is diligent. [195] Diligence in the present context seems to refer specifically to moral conduct, in fact both versions indicate that Dhānañjāni’s lack of diligence was that he engaged in larceny, due to the bad influence of
his new wife. [196]
Sāriputta eventually came to Rājagaha and visited Dhānañjāni. [197] When taken to task MN II 186
by Sāriputta, [198] Dhānañjāni excused himself by explaining that, being a householder, he
had to look after others. The two versions agree that Dhānañjāni mentioned the need to
look after:

193 [[MA27]] at T I 456b8: “the monk community and the nun community ... the community of male lay followers and the community of female lay followers ... do they wish to frequently see the Buddha and delight in hearing the Dharma”, ... ... ? According to [[MA27]] Sāriputta repeated the same question also in relation to recluses and Brahmins.
194 [[MA27]] at T I 456b25: “he is an old friend of mine [from the time] when I had not yet gone forth”,
.
195 [[MN97]] at MN II 185,14: kacci ... dhānañjāni brāhma�o appamatto ti? On hearing from the other monk
about Dhānañjāni’s conduct, according to [[MN97]] at MN II 185,21 Sāriputta voiced his disappointment
and reflected that he should meet Dhānañjāni, a reaction not described in [[MA27]]
196 While in [[MN97]] at MN II 185,19 the role played by the wife is mentioned in the other monk’s description of Dhānañjāni’s conduct, in [[MA27]] at T I 457b28 it is Dhānañjāni himself who, on being taken to
task by Sāriputta, attributes his unrighteous conduct to the influence of his wife.
197 [[MN97]] at MN II 186,2 narrates that, when Sāriputta arrived, Dhānañjāni was at his cowshed getting his 比丘眾, 比丘尼眾 優婆塞眾, 優婆夷眾 欲數見佛, 樂聞法耶
cows milked, gāvo go��he dohāpeti (B [e] -MN II 396,18 and S [e] -MN II 624,13: duhāpeti). [[MA27]] at T I
456c10 instead reports that he was “punishing residents”, . The idea of “punishing”, literally 是我
昔日未出家友 “inflicting pain”, could be due to mistaking √duh, “to milk”, for √dru, “to harm” or “to hurt”. The occurrence of “residents” is less easily explained, although perhaps the idea that someone is being harmed
or hurt might have led to a misinterpretation of go��ha or go��ha, “cow-pen”, for gotta or gotra, “clan”.
Alternatively, the reference to the “residents” could be a gloss introduced by the translator. A mistaking
of √duh for √dru could occur more easily in a Prākrit in which, like in Pāli, the two forms are not distinguishable by the occurrence of an r in the latter (cf. PED: 328 s.v. duhati “to milk”, s.v. duhana “one
who injures”), whereas such a mistaking would be less probable had the original been in Sanskrit.
198 While according to [[MN97]] at MN II 186,19 Sāriputta asked Dhānañjāni if he was diligent, according to
[[MA27]] at T I 456c21 Sāriputta right away accused him of his larceny. This stands to some extent in contrast to the standard procedure depicted in the discourse for investigating the misdoings of someone, 苦治居民
which is to ascertain first with the culprit if, what has been reported about his misdoings, is correct, cf.,
e.g., [[MN21]] at MN I 123,11 or [[MN22]] at MN I 132,9 and their parallels [[MA193]] at T I 744a23 and [[MA200]] at T I 763c5. The same is also a standard procedure in the Vinaya. This type of approach appears to
have been part of common etiquette and a generally approved way of going about a rumour or an allegation. In view of this, for Sāriputta to straightaway rebuke Dhānañjāni, without any inquiry, as reported
in [[MA27]] strikes an unfamiliar note.

The Majjhima-nikāya version points out that he also had to look after friends, relatives, and guests (see table 10.3). [199] Instead of friends, relatives and guests, the Madhyama-āgama mentions his need to support recluses and Brahmins. [200]


Table 10.3: Householder’s Cares in [[MN97]] and [[MA27]] [201]

|[[MN97]]|[[MA27]]|
|---|---|
|parents (1)<br>wife and children (2)<br>slaves (3)<br>friends (4)<br>relatives (5)<br>guests (6)<br>dead ancestors (7)<br>gods (8)<br>king (9)<br>oneself (10)|oneself (→ 10)<br>parents (→ 1)<br>wife and children (→ 2)<br>slaves (→ 3)<br>king (→ 9)<br>gods (→ 8)<br>dead ancestors (→ 7)<br>recluses and Brahmins<br> <br>(≠ 4-6)|



To look after one’s friends fits the present context just as well as the need to support
recluses, since in both versions Dhānañjāni had been quite eager to offer food to Sāriputta, [202] thereby showing his willingness to support a recluse, an action which at the
same time would also have been an act of looking after an old friend.
On being questioned by Sāriputta, in both versions Dhānañjāni had to admit that, on
being reborn in hell due to evil conduct, he would not stand a chance to get respite by
explaining that he had acted for the sake of others. The Dhānañjāni-sutta adds that not
only would he not be able to get away with such a request, but even those for whose
sake he undertook unwholesome deeds would not be able to intervene on his behalf. [203]


199 [[MN97]] at MN II 186,23.
200 [[MA27]] at T I 456c25: “giving gifts to recluses and Brahmins”, .
201 Particularly noteworthy is that [[MN97]] at MN II 186,27 puts the care to be given by Dhānañjāni to himself as the last in its list, while [[MA27]] at T I 456c23 has the same as the first in its presentation.
202 [[MA27]] at T I 456c11+16 depicts Dhānañjāni’s attempt to offer food in a particularly respectful manner,
relating that, on seeing Sāriputta, the Brahmin arranged his clothes so as to uncover one shoulder, held
his palms together in respect to welcome him and then took a golden vessel in an attempt to offer food
to Sāriputta, an attempt he repeated three times.
203 Except for the last case in [[MN97]] at MN II 188,10, which takes up the case of evil deeds undertaken for
one’s own sake. In this case, an intervention by those for whose sake the evil was done is evidently out
of question. The corresponding passage in [[MA27]] at T I 456c29 does not cover the case of doing evil

Chapter 10 Brāhma�a-vagga                                   -  569


According to both versions, Sāriputta explained that it was possible for Dhānañjāni
to fulfil his responsibilities by earning his livelihood in a righteous manner. [204] Dhānañjāni was delighted by Sāriputta’s exposition, according to the Madhyama-āgama version this was the case to such an extent that he formerly took refuge and declared himself a lay disciple. [205]
The Dhānañjāni-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel record that on a later occasion Dhānañjāni fell sick. [206] When Sāriputta came to visit him, [207] Dhānañjāni illustrated
his headache with the image of his head being split by a strong man with a sword, or a
strap being tightened around his head, followed by comparing his stomach pains to the
belly of an ox that is carved up by a butcher, and his fever to a man who is being roasted
by two other men over hot coals or a fire. [208]
According to the Dhānañjāni-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel, Sāriputta described to Dhānañjāni an ascending series of prospective rebirths, ranging from hell to


for one’s own sake at all, which fits the context well, since to do evil for one’s own sake would be a
rather lame excuse when confronted with the wardens of hell.
204 [[MN97]] at MN II 188,21 precedes this with a question and answer exchange, during which Sāriputta
questions Dhānañjāni if it were better to support his parents, etc., in a righteous or in an unrighteous
manner, a catechism not found in [[MA27]] A quotation in the Karmavibha�ga in Kudo 2004: 108,4 or in
Lévi 1932a: 55,19 on properly supporting one’s parents without doing evil appears to be taken from the
present context. The Karmavibha�ga refers to its source as the Dhana�jaya-sūtra.
205 According to [[MA27]] at T I 457c1, Dhānañjāni wanted to take refuge with Sāriputta, who told him that
he should rather take refuge with the Buddha.
206 While according to [[MN97]] at MN II 191,34 Dhānañjāni sent a messenger to inform Sāriputta of his condition, according to the [[MA27]] at T I 457c20 Sāriputta was told by another monk who had just come
from Rājagaha that, although Dhānañjāni was now eager to see the Buddha and delighted in hearing the
Dharma, he was not well. This passage thus comes as a counterpart to the earlier instance in [[MA27]]
when a monk from Rājagaha had informed Sāriputta that Dhānañjāni was well, but was not eager to see
the Buddha and did not delight in hearing the Dharma.
207 According to [[MA27]] at T I 457c27, on seeing Sāriputta approach, Dhānañjāni tried to get up from his
bed, but was told by Sāriputta to remain where he was.
208 A minor difference is that, according to [[MN97]] at MN II 193,2+14, the first three similes illustrate the
action of violent winds, adhimattā vātā, in Dhānañjāni’s head and belly. In [[MA27]] however, they illustrate his pain, as instead of winds [[MA27]] at T I 458a6 simply speaks of his “headache”,, and
[[MA27]] at T I 458a9 of his “abdominal pain”, . According to ancient India medicine, particular
‘winds’ are responsible for the different motions that take place within the body. [[MN62]] at MN I
422,30 refers to such winds as “up-going winds”, uddha�gamā vātā, and “down-going winds”, adhogamā vātā, which according to an explanation given in Vism 350,22 are responsible for upwards motions such as vomiting and belching, and for downward motions such as the expelling of excrements
and urine. Ñā�amoli 1987: 98 note 24 explains that such winds refer to “motion or driving force rather
than what moves or is moved”. From the perspective of ancient Indian medicine, an imbalance in these
winds causes disease. An example of this can be found in Vin I 205,1, which reports that the monk Pilindavaccha was afflicted by wind, vātābādho hoti. He was given an oil decoction as remedy, which
suggests his disease to have been a problem related to the stomach and/or digestion. Vin I 205, 頭痛 17+24
records that Pilindavaccha also had winds in his limbs and joints, 腹痛 a�gavāta and pabbavāta, which according to Horner 1951/1982: 278-279 could refer to rheumatism. On these cases of affliction by “wind”
cf. also Zysk 1991: 92-96.

the Brahmā world. On hearing Sāriputta speak of rebirth in the Brahmā world, in both
versions Dhānañjāni expressed his enthusiasm for such a prospect. [209] According to the
Majjhima-nikāya version, on seeing Dhānañjāni’s reaction, Sāriputta reflected that he
would show Dhānañjāni the way to rebirth in the Brahmā world, a reflection not recorded in the Madhyama-āgama version.

MN II 195  Both versions report that Sāriputta taught Dhānañjāni the practice of the four brahmavihāras as a boundless radiation in all directions. The Madhyama-āgama version
makes explicit what is only implicit in the Majjhima-nikāya version, as it states that
Dhānañjāni put Sāriputta’s instructions into practice and developed the four brahmavihāras. [210] The two versions agree that, after Sāriputta had left, Dhānañjāni passed away
and was reborn in the Brahmā world. [211]
The Dhānañjāni-sutta and its parallel continue with a somewhat different evaluation
of the teachings given by Sāriputta to Dhānañjāni. In the Majjhima-nikāya version, the
reciters themselves voice their disapproval of Sāriputta’s act as part of their narrative
presentation. They indicate that Sāriputta had left after establishing Dhānañjāni in the
“inferior Brahmā world”, even though “there still was more to be done by him”. [212]
The Majjhima-nikāya account continues by reporting that the Buddha expressed the
same disapproval in front of other monks as soon as he saw Sāriputta approaching from
afar. [213]
Once Sāriputta had arrived, according to the Majjhima-nikāya version the Buddha
asked him directly why he had only established Dhānañjāni in the inferior Brahmā
world and left when there was still more to be done, a question implying a reproach. [214]
In this way, the Majjhima-nikāya version expresses disapproval of Sāriputta’s action
three times.
According to the Madhyama-āgama account, when the Buddha saw Sāriputta from
afar he rather praised Sāriputta’s wisdom. [215] After praising Sāriputta’s wisdom, the

209 While in [[MN97]] at MN II 194,24 Dhānañjāni twice exclaims that Sāriputta had mentioned the “Brahmā
world”, brahmaloko ti, in [[MA27]] at T I 458a26 he twice proclaims “the Brahmā world is supreme”,
.
210 [[MA27]] at T I 458b12: “he practised the four divine abodes, abandoned sensuality and cast aside thoughts
of sensuality, and on the breaking up of the body with the ending of life he was born in the Brahmā
heaven”,
211 According to [[MN97]] at MN II 195,16, Dhānañjāni asked Sāriputta to pay homage to the Buddha on his
behalf, a detail not found in [[MA27]]
212 [[MN97]] at MN II 195,20: sati uttarikara�īye, hīne brahmaloke pati��hāpetvā (Ce-MN II 698,9: uttari�
kara�īye).
213 [[MN97]] at MN II 195,25.
214 [[MN97]] at MN II 196,1. While [[MN97]] ends after Sāriputta’s reply without the standard conclusion to a 梵天
最勝 discourse, [[MA27]] at T I 458b26 indicates that Sāriputta delighted in what the Buddha had said, adding
to this the delight experienced by innumerable hundreds of thousands of beings, . Minh
Chau 1964/1991: 37 cites this conclusion as an example for Madhyama-āgama passages that “strike a
rather exaggerated note, unknown to the moderate attitude of early Buddhism 修習四梵室, 斷欲捨欲念, 身壞命終生梵天中. ”.
215 [[MA27]] at T I 458b16 attributes to Sāriputta a series of different types of wisdom, similar to [[MN111]] at
MN III 25,5.
無量百千眾


Chapter 10 Brāhma�a-vagga                                   -  571


Buddha explained to the other assembled monks that Sāriputta had successfully taught
Dhānañjāni the path to the Brahmā world, adding that if Sāriputta had continued to
teach the Brahmin further, Dhānañjāni would have understood the Dharma. [216]
Similar to the Majjhima-nikāya version, the Buddha then asked Sāriputta why he had
not taught Dhānañjāni something higher than rebirth in the Brahmā world. As in the
Majjhima-nikāya version, Sāriputta explained that he had adapted his teaching to the
natural inclination of Dhānañjāni.
Hence both versions make essentially the same point, in the sense that it would have
been possible to lead Dhānañjāni to a higher attainment. Yet, the way they go about
making this point is markedly different. The Buddha’s remark and subsequent question
in the Majjhima-nikāya version imply a reproach, as Sāriputta is presented as someone
who has failed to do his duty. In the Madhyama-āgama version, however, instead of
reproaching Sāriputta for not having done his duty, the Buddha much rather praises
Sāriputta’s wisdom.
Thus, while the Madhyama-āgama version even gives praise to Sāriputta, the reciters
of the Majjhima-nikāya version consider his teachings to Dhānañjāni blameworthy to
such an extent that, in addition to recording how the Buddha expressed his disapproval
to the other monks and also directly reproached Sāriputta, they present the same criticism as part of their narrative description. This occurs only rarely in the discourses,
where the sections spoken by the narrator usually serve to introduce or conclude events
by relating circumstances or supplying additional information, but normally do not
present explicit evaluations in the way this is done in the present instance.
This is noteworthy, since in the Theravāda tradition Sāriputta is usually held in high
regard. [217] His teaching of the path to rebirth in the Brahmā world also does not seem to
be particularly objectionable, since the next but one discourse in the Majjhima-nikāya,
the Subha-sutta, reports that the Buddha did exactly the same. [218]
In this way, the present difference between the Dhānañjāni-sutta and its Madhyamaāgama parallel confirms a point made already earlier, in that differences and variations
between Pāli and Chinese versions of the same discourse need not be expressions of sectarian bias. [219] If the school affiliation of the Dhānañjāni-sutta had influenced the pre

216 [[MA27]] at T I 458b19: “if [Sāriputta] had continued to teach him higher, he would have quickly known
the Dharma”, .
217 Minh Chau 1964/1991: 21 contrasts the eminent position held by Sāriputta in the Theravāda tradition
with the high esteem of Mahākassapa prevalent in the Sarvāstivāda tradition.
218 [[MN99]] at MN II 207,14 and its parallel [[MA152]] at T I 669c5. The circumstance that the Buddha did not
teach Subha something higher suggests that, unlike Dhānañjāni, Subha may not have had the potential
to understand higher teachings. Moreover, Subha was still young and not on his deathbed, which would
leave open the possibility that on a later occasion he might be given further instructions. Nevertheless,
the fact that the Buddha only taught Subha the path to rebirth in the Brahmā world shows that to teach
this path is not necessarily seen as objectionable in itself.
219 Cf. above p. 381 note 211, Anālayo 2007i: 37, and id. 2008a: 16. With this I do not intend to rule out
sectarian influence, in fact a probable instance of such influence can be seen right away in my next 若復上化者, 速知法
study of [[MN99]] cf. below p. 573 the discussion regarding the reference to vibhajjavāda. My point is


572   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


sent passage, the Theravāda version should have avoided putting any blame on him.
Thus, when evaluating such differences, it needs to be taken into consideration that
variations need not invariably reflect sectarian concerns.


[[MN98]] Vāse��ha-sutta

The Vāse��ha-sutta, the “discourse to Vāse��ha”, expounds the qualities of a true
Brahmin. This discourse recurs in the Sutta-nipāta. [220] Otherwise, so far no parallel to
this discourse appears to have been identified.


[[MN99]] Subha-sutta

The Subha-sutta, the “discourse to Subha”, reports a discussion between the Buddha
and the Brahmin Subha during which the Buddha taught his visitor the path to the Brahmā world. This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama. [221] In addition to this
parallel, a few parts of a version of the present discourse have been preserved in a Sanskrit fragment. [222]

MN II 197  The Subha-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel begin by describing that the Brahmin Subha, being recommended to do so, went to visit the Buddha. [223] According to the
Majjhima-nikāya version, Subha asked the Buddha’s opinion about the Brahminical
view that a householder accomplishes the proper way, while someone gone forth fails
to do so. [224]


only that sectarian influence is not the sole way how differences between orally transmitted texts can
come about.
220 [[SN22.3]] at Sn p. 115-123 (comprising stanzas [[SNP594-656]]); for parallels in the Jain Uttarājjhaya�a to
some of the verses found in [[SN22.3]] cf. Charpentier 1910b: 65-68.
221 The parallel is [[MA152]] at T I 666c-670a and has the title “discourse to Suka”,, thereby employing the name of the Brahmin protagonist of several parallels to [[MN135]] a discourse whose Pāli version
speaks instead of the Brahmin Subha, just as [[MN99]] Although [[MN99]] and [[MA152]] thus adopt a different name, they agree on taking the respective name of their Brahmin protagonist as the title of the discourse. While [[MN99]] takes place in Jeta’s Grove by Sāvatthī, [[MA152]] has the Bamboo Grove by Rājagaha as its location. For a remark on [[MA152]] cf. Minh Chau 1964/1991: 61. Akanuma 1929/1990: 168
lists also T 79 as a parallel, which, however, is rather a parallel to [[MN135]]
222 This is the so far unpublished fragment no. 2375/37 of the Schøyen collection, identified by Peter Skilling (I am indebted to Jens-Uwe Hartmann for kindly providing me with a preliminary draft transliteration of this fragment). Fragment 2375/37A1 sets in with a reference to celibacy as the second quality
listed by the young Brahmin, corresponding to the third quality listed in MN II 199, 鸚鵡經 15, fragment 2375/
37Bz refers to the protagonist of the discourse as śubho mā�avo.
223 While according to [[MN99]] at MN II 196,16 Subha had inquired if there were arahants in Sāvatthī and
was thereon told to visit the Buddha, according to [[MA152]] at T I 667a2 he had asked after a renowned
teacher with a substantial following. [[MA152]] at T I 667a13 also differs from [[MN99]] in as much as it
describes the splendid sight of the Buddha, who was emanating a bright light like a golden mountain.
This is a frequent pericope in the Madhyama-āgama, cf. above p. 408 note 94.
224 [[MN99]] at MN II 197,6. A comparable Brahminical disdain for going forth, although phrased differently,


Chapter 10 Brāhma�a-vagga                                   -  573


In the Madhyama-āgama version, the view presented by the Brahmin visitor was that
a householder is superior to someone gone forth in regard to being able to reach understanding and knowledge. [225]
According to the Subha-sutta, the Buddha explained that he was one who would make
a declaration on such a matter after carrying out an analysis, using the term vibhajjavāda in this explanation. [226] The parallel version in the Madhyama-āgama similarly indicates that the Buddha would answer Subha’s question with the help of an analytical
explanation, with the difference that, according to its presentation, Subha had requested
such an analytical explanation. [227]
This minor difference introduces a slight shift of emphasis, as in the Madhyama-āgama version the Buddha’s reply simply takes up something suggested by his visitor. In
the Majjhima-nikāya discourse, in contrast, the Buddha’s reference to carrying out an
analysis comes without any external prompting, so that here the analytical approach
stands out as a qualification the Buddha himself attributes to his way of replying to questions.
This slight shift of emphasis probably reflects the respective textual affiliation, as
during later stages of the history of Buddhism the term vibhajjavāda came to be closely
associated with the Theravāda tradition. [228]


can be found in the Mahāvastu in Basak 1968/2004: 133,8 or in Senart 1897: 221,2: “going forth ... is
of little worth, of little profit, of little power, [deserving] little praise”, pravrajyā ... alpārthikā ca alpabhogā ca alpeśākyā ca alpānuśa�sā ca.
225 [[MA152]] at T I 667a19 reports the proposal that a householder “will reach proper understanding and
therefore knowledge in accordance with the Dharma”,, unlike someone who goes
forth. [[MA152]] also differs from [[MN99]] in as much as Subha does not present this as a Brahminical view,
but only indicates that he had heard this, .
226 [[MN99]] at MN II 197,10: “in this matter, I am one who speaks [after carrying out] an analysis”, vibhajjavādo kho aham ettha (S [e] -MN II 650,18: vibhajavādo). The term vibhajjavādin recurs in [[AN10.94]] at
AN V 190,18, where it similarly qualifies the analytical approach of the Buddha. Cousins 2001: 133
comments that in these instances the Buddha “is never simply described as a vibhajja-vāda or vibhajjavādin; it is always a question of being one who responds critically in a particular manner, as indicated
by the pronoun ettha. In fact, elsewhere and on other issues, the Buddha’s position is represented as unequivocal ... there would in fact be some support in the Nikāyas for calling him [also] an eka�sa-vādin
... in the Po��hapāda-sutta (D I 191) we find the Buddha declaring that he has made known 便得善解, 則知如法 eka�sikā
teachings, namely the Four Noble Truths”, cf. also Abeynayake 2009b: 95, Karunadasa 2000: 27 or id.
2010: 286, Jain 1985: 62, Prasad 1972b: 106, Rhys Davids 1938/1978: 99, and Sujāto 2006: 137. 我所聞
227 [[MA152]] at T I 667a23: “I shall provide you with an analytical explanation”,, in reply to the Brahmin’s requests for an analytical explanation in [[MA152]] at T I 667a21: “may you now
analyse this matter for me”, . Hirakawa 1997: 184 indicates to stand for
vibhajavādin, cf. also Soothill 1937/2000: 140. In other contexts, can simply stand for explaining something in detail.
228 According to the Mahāva�[[SA5]].271-272 in Be-Mhv 40, at the council of Pā�aliputta the Theravādins
claimed to be Vibhajjavādins, cf. also Bareau 1955: 206 and Oldenberg 1879/1997: xlii. Similarly,
Vism 711,23 uses the term Vibhajjavādin as an epithet expressing praiseworthiness in its eulogy of a
Mahāvihāra monk. In contrast, the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya reckons those who were at odds with the
Sarvāstivāda doctrine on the existence of past and future phenomena to be vibhajyavādina�/ /

574   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


Another minor difference is that according to the Madhyama-āgama account the
Buddha began each of his replies by telling Subha to listen carefully to what he was
going to say. [229] This turn of speech is not found in the Subha-sutta, although a similar
injunction occurs frequently in other Majjhima-nikāya discourses. [230]
At a later point, the Madhyama-āgama parallel to the Subha-sutta employs this injunction in quite a unique manner, as it describes that Subha also told the Buddha to
listen carefully. [231] Although several Pāli discourses depict how a monk tells another
monk to listen well and in one instance even record that a householder told a monk to
listen well, [232] there does not seem to be a single Pāli discourse in which anyone tells
the Buddha to listen well.
The Madhyama-āgama version’s presentation clearly is the more unusual reading,
the lectio difficilior. When evaluating this more unusual reading, it could be noted that,
according to both versions, the Buddha had just invited Subha in a very polite manner
to explain what the Brahmins reckoned as the five bases for merit. [233] The commentary
does not give further details as to why the Buddha extended this invitation in such a
polite manner. In both versions, Subha replied that he was willing to speak on such a subject when being in a company like the Buddha and his monks. This gives the impression that for him to speak on this subject possibly depended on the audience, in the
sense that perhaps Brahmins would not easily proclaim such teachings in public.
If Subha was about to deliver Brahminical teachings that were considered to some
extent esoteric, it would be less surprising if he were to tell the Buddha to listen well,
perhaps slipping into a turn of speech normally used when instructing other Brahmins
on this matter.


, cf. Abhidh-k 5:25 in Pradhan 1967: 296,6, with its Chinese parallels in T 1558 at T XXIX
104b27 and T 1559 at T XXIX 257c27. Thus, for the compilers of the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya this term
carried negative connotations. On the term vibhajjavāda as representative of the Theravāda tradition cf.
also, e.g., Anālayo 2009m, Cousins 2001, Karunadasa 2000 or id. 2010: 282-293, Prasad 1972b: 105113, and Shwe Zan Aung 1915/1979: xl; on the same term in other Buddhist schools cf. Dutt 1978:
208-210. Cox 2004b: 506 explains that “the name Vibhajyavāda might be best characterized as a loose
umbrella term for those, excluding the Sarvāstivādins, who belonged to the original Sthavira branch”.
229 E.g., [[MA152]] at T I 667a22: “listen, pay careful attention”, .
230 E.g., in [[MN54]] at MN I 360,17: su�āhi sādhuka� manasi karohi, an injunction that in this case is absent from the corresponding Madhyama-āgama parallel, [[MA203]] at T I 773b2. At times, the same in分別部 junction occurs in both versions, cf., e.g., [[MN27]] at MN I 178,11: su�āhi sādhuka� manasi karohi and
its parallel [[MA146]] at T I 656c11: . Thus, both collections make use of this pericope, although
not always in the same discourses.
231 [[MA152]] at T I 667c10: “Gotama, listen well, Gotama”, .

If this turn of speech should indeed have been part of the original discourse, it could
easily be imagined how during the process of oral tradition it could have been lost, as
for a layman to tell the Buddha to listen carefully must have appeared odd to the reciters and runs counter to their natural tendency, evident in the discourses, to enhance the
status of the Buddha.
Returning to the discussion described in the Subha-sutta, in reply to Subha’s proposal about the superiority of the householder’s way of life, according to both versions
the Buddha explained that he did not approve of householders or recluses who practise
wrongly, but commended both if they practised rightly. [234]
Subha then presented the Buddha with the view that the activity of a householder is
of greater fruit than the activity of someone who goes forth. [235] In both versions, the
Buddha explained that the activity of a householder could yield great or small fruit, just
as the activity of a recluse may yield great or small fruit. Both versions illustrate the
activity of a householder with the example of agriculture and the life of someone gone
forth with the example of engaging in trade, an activity that involves comparatively
less effort.
The Subha-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel next turn to the five bases for
merit proclaimed by the Brahmins, which they list with some variation in sequence
(see table 10.4).
In both versions, the Buddha highlights that the Brahmins’ proclamation of these five
bases for merit was not based on personal realization, a situation comparable to a file
of blind men leading each other. [236] According to both versions, Subha was displeased
with this comparison and reacted by quoting a saying by the Brahmin Pokkharasāti, [237]
in which Pokkharasāti derided recluses and Brahmins who claim to have reached a superhuman state.


234 [[AN2.9]] at AN I 69,14 records the Buddha making a similar point, also in relation to accomplishing the
proper way. Bluck 2002: 7 notes that such passages indicate some degree of “‘complementariness’ between monastics and lay disciples”, in that what really counts is proper practice in both cases. Shiraishi
1996: 188 observes that, according to the position taken by the Buddha, “whether one is a householder
or whether one leaves the home, one is still required to abandon the wrong course of action”.
235 According to [[MN99]] at MN II 197,19, Subha also suggested that the activity of a householder requires
greater effort, whereas according to [[MA152]] at T I 667b12 it was the Buddha in his reply to Subha who
brought up the issue of which activity requires greater effort.
236 [[MA152]] at T I 668a15 differs in so far as, instead of blind men, the simile is concerned with blind children, . [[MA152]] at T I 667c29 also reports that Subha tried to defend his position by explaining that
the Brahmins base their faith on their oral tradition: “but the Brahmins base their faith on [what they
have] memorized”,, which brings to mind an argument raised by the Brahmin
Kāpa�hika in a similar discussion in [[MN95]] at MN II 170,24: “the Brahmins honour this as oral tradition”, anussavā p’ ettha brāhma�a payirūpāsantī ti.
237 Ps III 446,25 offers alternative explanations of the name Pokkharasāti, one of which is that he got this
name because of resembling a lotus, pokkharasadisattā. Lévi 1912: 501 explains that this commentarial
gloss points to an earlier stage when this name still had a d instead of a t, such as in its Sanskrit form
Pau�karasādi, as otherwise the word play on sadisa would not work, in fact the commentary mentions
both Pokkharasāti as well as Pokkharasādi.

Table 10.4: Five Bases for Merit in [[MN99]] and [[MA152]] [238]

MN II 201  The Subha-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel report in similar terms how, by
way of a question and answer exchange, the Buddha got Subha to admit that the proclamation made by Pokkharasāti was not appropriate. [239]

MN II 203   According to the Subha-sutta, the Buddha pointed out that Pokkharasāti was not able
to realize a superhuman state due to being obstructed by the five hindrances of sensual
desire, ill will, sloth-and-torpor, restlessness-and-worry, and doubt. The Madhyamaāgama version    - where the point at stake is knowing one’s own benefit, the benefit of another, and the mind of other recluses and Brahmins     - instead lists sensual desire, ill
will, personality view, clinging to rules, and doubt (see table 10.5).
Thus, instead of the two hindrances sloth-and-torpor and restlessness-and-worry, this
listing mentions personality view and clinging to rules, so that in the Madhyama-āgama version what obstructs clear vision are the five lower fetters, instead of the five hindrances. [240] This suggestion is unusual, since in other discourses the precondition for clear
vision is the removal of the five hindrances, [241] not an eradication of the five lower fetters. [242]


238 My survey is based on [[MA152]] at T I 669b16+27. This is, however, only a recapitulation of the original
listing in [[MA152]] at T I 667c10, which omits generosity and mentions asceticism twice, under two different headings, namely and . Note 13 in the Taishō edition suggests to take to stand for
cāga, generosity, but in view of the fact that [[MA152]] at T I 669b18 no longer mentions and instead has, “practise generosity”, it may be preferable to take at its usual meaning of “ascetic
practice” and consider the earlier occurrence of to have accidentally replaced .
239 [[MN99]] at MN II 201,13 compares the proclamation made by Pokkharasāti to a blind man who claims
that coloured forms, even and uneven, stars, the moon, and the sun do not exist because he cannot see
them. [[MA152]] at T I 668b17 illustrates the same only with the example of various types of visible form
(white or black, beautiful or ugly, long or short, far or near, gross or subtle), without bringing in stars,
the moon, or the sun.
240 [[MA152]] at T I 668c18: and, which correspond to sakkāyadi��hi and sīlabbataparāmāsa. [[MA152]] precedes these two with sensual desire and ill will, 熱行 苦行 and, and concludes its listing with doubt, 苦行
. As all five are introduced as “obstructions”,, “obstacles”,, and as causing 熱行 “blindness”,
, standard qualifications for the effect of the five hindrances, it would have been more natural to find 行施 苦行
a listing of the five hindrances instead of the five lower fetters. 熱行 行施
241 Cf., e.g., [[SN46.55]] at SN V 121,17 or [[AN5.51]] at AN III 63,22.
242 Perhaps the presentation in [[MA152]] is the outcome of a confusion of the five hindrances with the five
lower fetters. Such a confusion could easily occur, as Madhyama-āgama discourses usually list the five
fetters in a sequence where sensual desire and ill will stand at the beginning and doubt comes as the last
term, cf. [[MA4]] at T I 424c21, [[MA38]] at T I 481a26, and [[MA205]] at T I 778c20, a sequence also found

The Subha-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel agree in next taking up the five
types of sensual pleasure, explaining that Pokkharasāti was incapable of vision because
he indulged in sensual pleasures without seeing any danger in such indulgence. [243] Both
versions illustrate the difference between sensual pleasures and non-sensual pleasures
by comparing fire that burns in dependence on fuel to the much brighter fire that due to
an act of supernormal power would burn without any fuel. [244]
The Subha-sutta next illustrates non-sensual pleasure that is free from sensuality with
the example of the first and the second jhāna, an illustration not found in its Madhyama-āgama counterpart. The Majjhima-nikāya version continues by reporting that the
Buddha asked Subha what the Brahmins consider most fruitful among the five bases
for merit declared by them. Subha replied that generosity was considered the most
meritorious among the five. This exchange is also absent from the Madhyama-āgama
version. [245]
Both versions bring up the hypothetical case of visitors to a Brahminical sacrifice
who, having the wish to get the best seat and food, are annoyed when this does not
happen. [246] When Subha explains that the generosity of the Brahmins is motivated by

in the Sa�gītiparyāya, T 1536 at T XXVI 419c7. The sequence for listing the fetters adopted in the
Madhyama-āgama is thus similar to the standard listing of the hindrances, with the first two and the
last items corresponding, a similarity which more easily can lead to confusing the two schemes. The
Pāli discourses adopt a different sequence for the five fetters, as they list first the three fetters related to
stream-entry, and then the fetters of sensual desire and ill will, cf., e.g., [[MN64]] at MN I 432,15, a pattern also adopted in the Dīrgha-āgama, cf. [[DA9]] at T II 51b10, in the Sa�yukta-āgama, cf. [[SA490]] at T
II 127c17, [[SA820]] at T II 210c4, [[SA821]]at T II 211a1, [[SA822]] at T II 211a26, [[SA823]] at T II 211b20,
[[SA918]] at T II 233a12, [[SA928]] at T II 236c24, [[SA934]] at T II 239a23, and in the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya, Abhidh-k 5:43 in Pradhan 1967: 310,2, T 1558 at T XXIX 108c29, and T 1559 at T XXIX 262b1.
243 The two versions differ in the sequence of their presentation, as [[MN99]] at MN II 203,10 first takes up
the five types of sensual pleasure and then turns to Pokkharasāti’s infatuation with them, while [[MA152]]
at T I 668c23 first examines Pokkharasāti’s infatuation with sensuality and then takes up the five types
of sensual pleasure.
244 According to [[MA152]] at T I 669a7, Subha replied that such a fire without fuel does not exist and would
be possible only through an act of supernormal power, to which the Buddha agreed. According to [[MN99]] at MN II 203,27, however, it was the Buddha who made this point.
245 As in both versions the Buddha next takes up the topic of generosity, the question and answer recorded
in [[MN99]] seem to be required to introduce this change of topic.
246 The otherwise similar exposition in [[MA152]] at T I 669a17 differs in so far as, instead of describing two



MN II 204


578   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


compassion and not by the wish to vex their visitors, the Buddha concludes that compassion should be reckoned as a sixth basis for merit, a proposal to which Subha has to
agree. In both versions, Subha also has to admit that he sees the five bases for merit
more often among those who have gone forth than among householders.

MN II 205  According to the Majjhima-nikāya account, the Buddha reckoned the five bases of
merit proposed by the Brahmins as mere “equipment of the mind”, [247] in the sense that
they support the development of a mind free from ill will. The Madhyama-āgama version instead explains that the five bases of merit originate from a mind free from ill
will, without qualifying them as an equipment of the mind. [248]

MN II 206  The Majjhima-nikāya version reports that Subha asked if the Buddha knew and was
willing to teach him the path to union with Brahmā, in reply to which the Buddha described the practice of the brahmavihāras, illustrating their radiation with the example
of a vigorous trumpeter. The Madhyama-āgama version also records that the Buddha
taught Subha the practice of the brahmavihāras as a way to rebirth in the Brahmā world,
a practice similarly illustrated with the image of a trumpeter. [249] The Majjhima-nikāya
version concludes this description by proclaiming that, by developing the brahmavihāras in this way, no limiting action can remain, a statement not found in its Madhyamaāgama counterpart. [250]
In both versions, the Buddha illustrated his knowledge of the path to Brahmā with
the example of a man who has just come from a particular village and will therefore be
able to describe the way to that village without any hesitation. [251]


Brahmin visitors to a Brahminical sacrifice, it speaks of a young warrior, a young Brahmin, a young
merchant, and a young worker, each of which comes from one of the four directions to a food offering
by Brahmins.
247 [[MN99]] at MN II 205,32: cittassāha� ete parikkhāre vadāmi. The term cittaparikkhāra recurs in [[AN7.49]] at AN IV 62,5 as a motivation for giving gifts.
248 [[MA152]] at T I 669b24.
249 [[MA152]] differs from [[MN99]] in the sequence of its presentation, as it reports that, after describing the
practice of the brahmavihāras, the Buddha asked Subha if he thought such practice to lead to Brahmā’s
heaven, which Subha affirmed. After this, according to [[MA152]] at T I 670a7 Subha asked if the Buddha knew the path to Brahmā. This seems out of sequence, since it would make little sense for Subha to
ask if the Buddha knew this path after the Buddha had already described it.
250 [[MN99]] at MN II 208,2+6: “no limiting action remains or persists there”, ya� pamā�akata� kamma�,
na ta� tatrāvasissati, na ta� tatrāvati��hati, a statement the commentary Ps III 450,10 explains to imply that the powerful karmic effect of the brahmavihāra practice will be stronger than other karmas of
the sensual sphere and thus have a determining effect on the next rebirth. Although this statement is not
found in [[MA152]] a similar statement occurs in [[MA15]] at T I 438a14 (translated in Anālayo 2009f: 9),
parallel to an occurrence of such a statement in [[AN10.208]] at AN V 299,25. Aronson 1979: 31 relates
this notion to the image of the trumpeter who makes himself heard in all direction, explaining that the
trumpet blast “is not a measured performance. Similarly, when one cultivates love and the other attitudes according to the method given ... no measured intentions remain”.
251 A minor difference is that, while according to [[MN99]] at MN II 206,24 this person is a native of the particular village, [[MA152]] at T I 670a11 speaks of someone who has just gone to this village and come
back.


Chapter 10 Brāhma�a-vagga                                   -  579


According to both versions, Subha took refuge. [252] The Majjhima-nikāya discourse MN II 208
continues by describing how, after having left the Buddha, Subha met the Brahmin Jā�usso�i. This aftermath to the meeting between Subha and the Buddha is not found in
the Madhyama-āgama version.
Precisely the same meeting between a visitor who comes from the Buddha’s presence
and the Brahmin Jā�usso�i recurs as the introduction to the Cū�ahatthipadopama-sutta
and its Madhyama-āgama parallel, with the only difference that the person who met
Jā�usso�i was the wanderer Pilotika instead of the Brahmin Subha. [253] In the case of the
Cū�ahatthipadopama-sutta and its parallel, it was due to this meeting that Jā�usso�i
felt inspired to visit the Buddha. The Cū�ahatthipadopama-sutta and its Madhyamaāgama parallel agree that the ensuing discourse inspired Jā�usso�i to take refuge and
become a lay disciple of the Buddha. [254] This makes it less probable that on another occasion he would again inquire of someone coming from the Buddha’s presence about
the Buddha’s wisdom, as if he had no personal knowledge of the Buddha and his way
of teaching.
Whereas in the Cū�ahatthipadopama-sutta Jā�usso�i’s inquiry is an important step
leading up to the ensuing discourse, in the Subha-sutta the same inquiry does not have
such a function. As in the case of the Subha-sutta this inquiry by Jā�usso�i is absent
from the parallel version, it is quite possible that during the course of the transmission of
the Majjhima-nikāya discourses Jā�usso�i’s inquiry, which originally belonged only to
the Cū�ahatthipadopama-sutta, was, perhaps even accidentally, added to the conclusion of the Subha-sutta.


[[MN100]] Sa�gārava-sutta [255]

The Sa�gārava-sutta, the “discourse to Sa�gārava”, records a discussion between the
Buddha and the Brahmin Sa�gārava during which the Buddha declared that his teaching was based on personal realization. This discourse does not have a parallel in the
Chinese Āgamas. [256] A version of this discourse has, however, been preserved in Sanskrit fragments. [257]


252 [[DN10]] at DN I 210,11 reports that Subha took refuge again in the presence of Ānanda after the Buddha
had passed away, perhaps by way of confirming his decision taken in the present discourse.
253 [[MN27]] at MN I 175,14 and [[MA146]] at T I 656a22.
254 [[MN27]] at MN I 184,16 and [[MA146]] at T I 658a24; on Jā�usso�i taking refuge cf. also above p. 41.
255 Se-MN II 667,1 reads Sagārava-sutta, a spelling of the Brahmin’s name employed throughout the Siamese edition of the present discourse.
256 The narration given in the introductory section of [[MN100]] recurs in similar form in [[SN7.1]] at SN I 160,6
(or SN [2] 187 at SN [2] I 344,5) and in its parallels [[SA1158]] at T II 308b21 and SĀ [2] 81 at T II 401c21, which
relate how the Brahmin woman Dhanañjānī’s praises of the Buddha angered her husband, who thereon
decided to confront the Buddha himself. During the ensuing meeting he was converted, after which he
decided to go forth and eventually became an arahant.
257 A full version of the discourse is part of the recently discovered Dīrgha-āgama manuscript and has been
edited and translated by Zhang 2004. Judging from the uddāna in Hartmann 2004b: 123, the Sanskrit


580   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


MN II 209   The Sa�gārava-sutta and its Sanskrit parallel begin by reporting a young Brahmin’s
irritation at witnessing a Brahmin woman proclaiming her devotion to the Buddha. [258]
On being told about the Buddha’s qualities, however, the young Brahmin expressed his
interest to meet the Buddha.

MN II 210   Once the Buddha had arrived in the vicinity, the Brahmin woman informed Sa�gārava − or Śa�karaka in the Sanskrit version − who thereupon approached the Buddha.

MN II 211  According to the Pāli account, Sa�gārava inquired about the grounds on which the
Buddha based his claim to knowledge. In reply, the Buddha differentiated between those
who claim knowledge based on:

       - oral tradition,

       - reasoning,

       - direct knowledge.
The Sa�gārava-sutta reports the Buddha explaining that direct knowledge was the
basis for what he taught. The Sanskrit version differs from the Pāli account in as much
as its listing of various claims to knowledge also mentions the denial of causality by
the Ajīvikas and the affirmation that everything is the outcome of former deeds by the
Jains (see table 10.6). [259]


discourse would agree with [[MN100]] in taking for its title the name of its Brahmin protagonist, which in
most occurrences in the fragment reads Śa�karaka (though two instances and the uddāna only read
Śa�kara), cf. also Zhang 2004: 5. While [[MN100]] at MN II 209,20 locates the discourse at Ca��alakappa in the Kosala country, the Sanskrit version speaks of Calakalpā in the Videha country, cf. fragment
344v5-6 in Zhang 2004: 9. In addition to this full parallel, sections of [[MN100]] have counterparts in SHT
IV 33 folios 28-29+33 (pp. 171-174, the last identified in SHT IX p. 369, cf. also SHT VII p. 233, SHT
VIII p. 162, and SHT IX p. 369), SHT IV 165 folios 24-26+42+58 (pp. 198-200 and 208, on folio 42
cf. also SHT IX p. 379, on folio 58 cf. also SHT X p. 403), SHT IV 180 folios 3-4+6 (pp. 214-215, the
last identified in SHT IX p. 392), SHT IX 2063e (p. 80), and Hoernle fragment 149/Add.32, no. 147 in
Hartmann 1991: 259-260. SHT IV 33 folios 28-29, SHT IV 165 folios 24-25, and Hoernle fragment
149/Add.32 parallel the introductory narration of the discourse at MN II 209-210. SHT IV 165 folio 26
and SHT IV 180 folios 3-4 parallel the examination of different sources for knowledge found at MN II
211. Hoernle fragment 149/Add.32 parallels part of the discussion on devas found at MN II 212,26.
SHT IV folio 28R4 and SHT IV 165 folio 25Vc locate the discourse at Ca�calakalpa or Cañcalakalpa.
SHT IV 165 folio 24R4, SHT IV 180 folio 4Ab+e, and Hoernle fragment 149/Add.32Vc, give the name
of the Brahmin as Śa�karaka or Śa�karaka.
258 The Sanskrit version indicates that this happened when she was serving the young Brahmin, who apparently was her husband (similar to [[SN7.1]] mentioned above in note 256), fragment 344v8 in Zhang
2004: 9: sā svasvāmina� śa�karaka� mā�avakam upati��ha�tī, a reading which, as noted by Zhang
2004: 53, appears to have a counterpart in SHT IV 33 folio 28R6: pati��a�tī.
259 Fragment 347 in Zhang 2004: 11-12, cf. also SHT IV 165 folio 26Va+c, which has preserved traivi(dyā�) and (a)nanuśrute�u dha[rm]e(�u svaya)[m]-anuprāpta�. Regarding the reference in [[MN100]] at
MN II 211,14 to those who are “entirely based on mere faith ... namely thinkers and investigators”, kevala� saddhāmattakena ... seyyathāpi takkī vīma�sī, Bodhi in Ñā�amoli 1995/2005: 1304 note 919
comments that “it is puzzling that the reasoners and investigators (takkī, vīma�sī) are here said to rely
on the basis of mere faith (saddhāmattakena). Elsewhere faith and reasoning are contrasted as two different grounds of conviction ... and ‘mere faith’ seems more closely allied with reliance on oral tradition than with reasoning and investigation”. In fact, “faith”, saddhā, and “examination-and-reasoning”,

By way of illustrating how such direct knowledge is acquired, the Sa�gārava-sutta
presents an autobiographical account of the Buddha’s awakening. [260] At the conclusion
of this account, Sa�gārava asked the Buddha about the existence of devas. [261]
The Sanskrit version agrees with the Pāli discourse that the Buddha laid claim to direct knowledge and illustrated this with an autobiographical account of his awakening.
The relation between these two sections is particularly evident in the Sanskrit version,
as here the young Brahmin inquires in what way the Buddha lays claim to direct knowledge, which then forms the occasion for the autobiographical account. [262]
A significant difference in the Sanskrit version is that the discussion on devas occurs
at the outset of the exchange between the Buddha and the young Brahmin, [263] followed
by the sources of knowledge and the autobiographical account (see table 10.7). [264]

ākāraparivitakka, are listed in [[MN95]] at MN II 170,27, [[MN101]] at MN II 218,16, and [[MN102]] at MN I
234,7 as two out of five sources of knowledge, a way of presentation that suggests them to differ from
each other. A reference to faith occurs also in the Sanskrit version, where this forms part of a proclamation made by each of the claimants to knowledge, cf., e.g., fragment 347r5 in Zhang 2004: 12 for the
case of the reasoners: śraddhāvādina smā iti pratijānate śīlavādina� tyāgavādina� śrutavādina� prajñāvādina sma iti pratijānate.
260 Ee-MN II 212,14 mentions only the first three jhānas in its account of the Buddha’s awakening, so that,
on following its presentation, he would not have developed the fourth jhāna before attaining the three
higher knowledges. This is quite obviously a mistake in this edition, in fact the corresponding passage
in B [e] -MN II 437,1, C [e] -MN II 756,11, and S [e] -MN II 686,8 mentions the fourth jhāna, and other discourses in the Nikāya and Āgamas regularly present the three higher knowledges as something to be
developed based on mastery of the fourth jhāna.
261 [[MN100]] at MN II 212,25: atthi devā ti? The emendation suggested by Norman 1977: 333 to atthi adhideva does not receive support from what has been preserved in the corresponding Sanskrit fragments,
cf. fragment 346v1-3 in Zhang 2004: 11 and Hoernle fragment 149/Add. 32 Re-f, no. 147 in Hartmann
1991: 260. Zhang 2004: 63 comments that such an emendation would in fact not fit the context too
well. Norman 1985: 150 suggests a similar emendation of the question atthi deva in [[MN90]] at MN II

Thus the Sanskrit version presents the following pattern:

 - the young Brahmin begins his discussion with the Buddha by broaching the topic
of the existence of devas,

 - in reply to the inquiry about devas, the Buddha affirms his knowledge of their
existence,

 - this affirmation leads to an inquiry on what sources of knowledge the Buddha
bases his response,

 - in reply, the Buddha distinguishes different claims to knowledge and then gives
an autobiographical account of his awakening as an exemplification of the fact
that his knowledge (about such things as the existence of devas) is based on personal realization.
Regarding the young Brahmin’s inquiry about devas, other discourses present Sa�gārava as someone who would have believed in their existence. [265] Hence, there seems to
be no reason to assume that Sa�gārava wanted to put into question what according to
the Sa�gārava-sutta was in fact a generally held belief in ancient India, [266] namely the
existence of devas. That is, the reason for Sa�gārava to ask after the existence of devas
would rather have been to find out the Buddha’s position on this topic.
The autobiographical account of the Buddha’s awakening mentions the intervention
of devas when he had considered completely desisting from food, and describes how
Brahmā invited the Buddha to teach. For Sa�gārava to ask his question about the existence of devas only after this account, as it the case in the Sa�gārava-sutta, is puzzling,
since one might wonder why Sa�gārava should ask if the Buddha accepted the existence of devas when their role in relation to the Buddha’s awakening had just been described. [267]


265 According to [[AN3.60]] at AN I 168,13 and its parallel [[MA143]] at T I 650b16, Sa�gārava declared that
he was a performer of sacrifices, which presupposes that he believed in the existence of recipients of
sacrificial offerings. According to [[SN7.21]] at SN I 182,28 (or SN [2] 207 at SN [2] I 393,8), Sa�gārava undertook ritual purification through bathing in water; [[SN46.55]] at SN V 121,14 = [[AN5.193]] at AN III
230,14 testify to his interest in memorizing Brahminical mantras. These passages indicate that he was
involved in traditional Brahminical beliefs and practices, making it improbable that he would doubt the
existence of devas.
266 [[MN100]] at MN II 213,6: “it is generally agreed in the world that there are devas”, ucce sammata� ...

with a probable counterpart in fragment 346v2 in Zhang 2004: 11: [u]ccai sa�matā ete.

to find Sa�gārava, at the end of this tremendous dissertation [i.e. the autobiographical account of the

In contrast, to inquire about what the Buddha had to say regarding the existence of
devas would fit as a first question to start the discussion. Other discourses report that
some contemporary recluses in ancient Indian – and Sa�garāva would presumably have
been aware of this - denied the existence of supernatural beings and heavenly worlds. [268]
Thus, it would be quite natural for Sa�garāva to start a discussion with a member of the
ancient Indian recluse tradition by at first finding out to what extent the Buddha agreed
to central aspects of the world view of Brahmins, such as belief in the existence of devas. By inquiring after the existence of devas, Sa�gārava would have been able to ascertain if there was at least this much of common ground between him and the Buddha.
From the Pāli account of the ensuing discussion, it seems as if the Buddha replied to
this question in such a way as to make it clear to Sa�gārava that for the Buddha the existence of devas was a matter of personal experience, not a mere belief. [269] Sa�gārava
apparently misunderstood this reply and even wondered if the Buddha was speaking a
falsehood. [270] The Buddha then clarified this misunderstanding by explaining that his reply was meant as an affirmation of the existence of devas. [271]

Buddha’s awakening] ... hurrying on to ask ... if there were devas ... I find the sudden introduction of
this question about devas rather perplexing”.
268 Cf., e.g., the view that in [[DN1]] at DN I 55,18 is attributed to Ajita Kesakambalī.

there were gods”, Horner 1957/1970: 401 as “certainly ... it is known to me that there are devas”, and
Ñā�amoli 1995/2005: 821 as “it is known to me to be the case ... that there are gods”, cf. also Ñā�ajivako 1970: 140: “the statement that there are goods ... is for me established by experience”. Harvey
1995a: 82 explains this passage to imply that the Buddha on this occasion “clearly distinguished between his ‘certain knowledge’ that gods existed and the commonly held belief that they did”. Marasinghe 1974: 127 discusses this passage and suggests it to mean that “in the above context ... I have
found that there are gods”; cf. also Saibaba 2005: 3-4, who reasons that the way the answer is formulated suggests that the Buddha “agreed upon the existence of [the] Buddhist conception of the devas
only”, which “differs from the Vedic conception of gods”. The implications of the ablative �hānaso in
the present passage are not entirely clear, as in other contexts �hānaso indicates that something happens
“immediately” or “on the spot”, cf., e.g., Vin III 70,23, [[SN8.8]] at SN I 193,6 (or SN [2] 216 at SN [2] I 416,2),
[[SN45.156]] at SN V 50,7, [[SN54.9]] at SN V 321,25, [[SN55.26]] at SN V 381,29, [[AN5.194]] at AN III 238,6,
[[AN7.16]] at AN III 298,2, [[AN8.46]] at AN IV 263,4, and [[AN10.60]] at AN V 108,29. Such a meaning
does not fit the present context, as it would make little sense for the Buddha to answer that he “immediately” or “on the spot” knew that there are devas. Perhaps �hānaso intends to underline the expression
vidita as a pointer to the Buddha’s personal realization, in the sense of “according to fact”. The use of
�hānaso (or whatever equivalent may have been found in the earliest Indic version of this passage) in a
somewhat unusual manner could then have caused Sa�gārava’s misunderstanding, for he might have
understood �hānaso to have a meaning related to �hāna as “possibility” or “occasion”, which would give
a sense of ambiguity or evasiveness to the Buddha’s reply. Fragment 346v2 in Zhang 2004: 11 reads
yenam ekā�śena vyākaro�i santi de[v]ā iti, and Hoernle fragment 149/Add. 32 Rb+d, no. 147 in Hartmann 1991: 260, has preserved: [tr]e[dā]nī� naikā�śena vyā and yena na ekā�śe[na] vyākaro�i sa�t(i), suggesting that in these versions a similar misunderstanding would have taken place.

The first part of this exchange is unfortunately not preserved too well in the Sanskrit
version. Nevertheless, from what has been preserved it becomes evident that, unlike
the Pāli version, the Sanskrit discourse continues with a simile. This simile contrasts
those who recognize a woman as a woman and a man as man with those who confuse
these two. [272] Although the context remains unclear, the simile might be another way of
underlining the Buddha’s affirmation of the existence of devas.

MN II 213  According to the Pāli version, at the end of the discourse Sa�gārava took refuge, [273]
whereas according to the Sanskrit version he rejoiced in the discourse and left. [274]


explanation does not fit the present version of [[MN100]] too well, as the Buddha had already described
his knowledge of the existence of devas in his autobiographical account. On the hypothesis that an earlier version of the discourse may have followed the sequence of events suggested by the Sanskrit fragments, it could be assumed that the Pāli commentarial explanation was taken over unchanged from an
ancient Indian commentary on this earlier version of the discourse, in which case the commentarial
gloss would fit quite well.
271 According to [[MN100]] at MN II 213,2, the Buddha clarified that, on hearing his earlier statement, “a
wise man should draw the definite conclusion that there are devas”, atha khv’ ettha viññūpurisena

wisdom that had caused him to misunderstand the Buddha’s reply.

## Chapter 11 Devadaha-vagga

[[MN101]] Devadaha-sutta

The Devadaha-sutta, the “discourse at Devadaha”, examines the fruitlessness of the
asceticism undertaken by the Jains. This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama. [1]
The Devadaha-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel begin by depicting the view
of the Jains that one’s present experience is determined by former deeds, whose effect
can be annihilated by ascetic practices. According to the Majjhima-nikāya account, the
view held by the Jains was that the destruction of deeds, achieved by annihilating former deeds through asceticism and by avoiding new deeds, leads to the destruction of
dukkha; the destruction of dukkha then leads to the destruction of feelings, whereby all
dukkha will be overcome. [2] The Madhyama-āgama account of the same view does not
mention the destruction of feeling, so that its description simply indicates that the destruction of former deeds leads to the destruction of dukkha, whereby all dukkha will
be transcended. [3]
The Devadaha-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel describe in similar terms how
the Buddha examined the position of the Jains. A minor difference is that, according to
the Majjhima-nikāya account, the Buddha also inquired if the Jains knew what kind of
evil deed they had done in the past. [4]


1 The parallel is [[MA19]] at T I 442b-445a and agrees with [[MN101]] on locating the discourse at Devadaha
in the Sakyan country. While [[MN101]] takes this location as its title, [[MA19]] has the title “discourse on
the Niga��has”, .
2 [[MN101]] at MN II 214,10: “from the destruction of action [results] the destruction of dukkha, from the destruction of dukkha [results] the destruction of feelings, from the destruction of feelings [it results that]
all dukkha will be exhausted”, kammakkhayā dukkhakkhayo, dukkhakkhayā vedanākkhayo, vedanākkhayā sabba� dukkha� nijji��a� bhavissatī ti.
3 [[MA19]] at T I 442c4: “having destroyed [former] deeds, the destruction of dukkha is attained; having attained the destruction of dukkha, the transcendence of dukkha is attained”,
. To propose that with the destruction of former deeds all dukkha will be destroyed seems
straightforward enough and there would perhaps be no need for additionally bringing in the destruction
of feelings. Nevertheless, the presentation found in [[MN101]] recurs in [[MN14]] at MN I 93,8 and [[AN3.74]]
at AN I 221,1. Counterparts to these two Pāli discourses agree with [[MA19]] in that they do not mention 尼乾經
the destruction of feelings; cf. [[MA100]] at T I 587b20, [[EA41.4]] at T II 744b5, T 54 at T I 849a18, and T
55 at T I 850c7 (these four being counterparts to [[MN14]]), and [[SA563]] at T II 147c10 (counterpart to [[AN3.74]]). Thus, a reference to the destruction of feelings in the context of a description of the rationale for
the ascetic practices of the Jains appears to be a trait of the Theravāda tradition. The basic principle that
karmic retribution has to be expiated in order to be able to reach liberation is indeed a central tenet of
Jain thought, cf., e.g., Bronkhorst 2000a: 119, Dundas 1992/2002: 97-102, Halbfass 2000: 75-85, Jain 諸業盡已, 則得苦盡, 得苦盡

MN II 214


586   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


MN II 216  The two versions illustrate the need to know how to overcome dukkha with the example of a man struck by a poisoned arrow, who on being properly treated by a physician
would in due time become healthy and be able to recollect how the pain experienced
during the medical treatment led to his present freedom from pain. The point of this
simile appears to be that to undergo pain is reasonable as long as it is part of a verifiable cure that eventually leads to freedom from pain.

MN II 218  According to the Majjhima-nikāya account, the Jains explained that their practice was
based on their teacher’s instruction. The Madhyama-āgama discourse reports the same
at a later point, after the Buddha had further examined the premises of the asceticism of
the Jains. [5]
In reply to the reliance of the Jains on the indications given by their teacher, according to both versions the Buddha pointed out that the following should not be taken as
sufficient bases for knowledge:

       - faith,

       - liking,

       - oral tradition,

       - reasoning,

       - acceptance of a view. [6]

MN II 219   The two parallel versions disclose the conditional relationship between the intensity
of the pain experienced by the Jains and the intensity of their striving, concluding that
the Jains were themselves responsible for the pain they experienced. According to the
report given in both versions, the Jains had to admit that it was not possible to achieve
the following:

       - change the time when the fruit of one’s former deeds ripen,

       - change karmic retribution to be experienced as either pleasant or unpleasant into
its opposite,

       - change a deed about to ripen, or not about to ripen, into its opposite.
The Devadaha-sutta stands alone in also examining the following impossibilities:

       - change the intensity with which a deed will be experienced,

       - avoid the fruition of a deed completely (see table 11.1). [7]
The present passage thus depicts Jain ascetics as accepting a wholesale refutation of
their doctrine by the Buddha, since it is precisely the idea that karmic retribution can be
influenced that underlies the undertaking of asceticism in the Jain tradition.

5 Unlike [[MN101]] at MN II 218,1, [[MA19]] at T I 443c5 does not record that the Jains claimed their teacher
to be omniscient.

With some variations in the sequence of their presentation, the Devadaha-sutta and
its Madhyama-āgama parallel list five grounds for criticizing the Jains (see table 11.2). [8]
According to these five grounds, the experience of pleasure and pain could be attributed to:

 - one’s former deeds,

 - a creator god,

 - the company one kept,

 - the type of one’s life-form,

 - one’s present practice. [9]
In all these cases the Jains are to be blamed, as their present painful experiences will
consequently have to be attributed to their former evil deeds, to an evil creator god, to
an evil company they kept, to an evil type of life-form, or to an evil type of practice. [10]

8 The differences between the two versions in this respect have already been surveyed by Kalupahana
1975: 34-35.
9 In relation to the last of these five, while [[MN101]] at MN II 222,16 speaks of the “present exertion” of
the Jains, di��hadhammupakkama (B [e] -MN III 8,24, C [e] -MN III 14,30, and S [e] -MN III 12,16: di��hadhammūpakkama), the corresponding fourth ground for censure in [[MA19]] at T I 443c28 refers to their “view”,
. Although the formulation differs, the implications appear to be the same, as the pain experienced by
the Jains is due to their present “exertion”, which is at the same time the outcome of their “view” that in
this way dukkha will be eradicated, hence I consider both versions to intend one’s present “practice”.
10 The assumption that the experience of pleasure and pain is due to one’s former deeds, to a creator god,
or to chance comes up again for discussion in [[AN3.61]] at AN I 173,16 and its parallel [[MA13]] at T I 435a28.
The rejection in [[MN101]] and [[MA19]] of the karmic fatalism of the Jains reflects the character of the early
Buddhist conception of causality, which is not fatalist or pre-deterministic, a characteristic highlighted
by several scholars, cf., e.g., de Silva 1991: 273, Federman 2010, Fujita 1982: 151, Gómez 1975: 82,
Halbfass 2000: 102, Harvey 2007: 59, Hershock 2005: 6-7, Jayatilleke 1968, id. 1973: 10, Jayawardhana 1988: 408, Ñā�aponika 1975: 91, Nelson 2005: 4, Pāsādika 2007: 319, Premasiri 2009: 69, Siderits
見 1987: 153, and Story 1975: 74. The reference to an evil creator god in the present passage exemplifies a
tendency in the early discourses, noted by Steinkellner 2006: 24, where “the idea of a creator-god was
mainly mocked and ridiculed”; cf. also Bohn 1921: 25-32 for the present and other instances of mockery
or criticism aimed at the Jains in particular. On the different premises on which the Jain tradition and early
Buddhism based their conceptions of karma and rebirth cf. also de Silva 1990b: 185.



MN II 222


588   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


While the Madhyama-āgama version presents this treatment as a five-fold criticism, [11]
the Majjhima-nikāya version reckons the same to be a criticism in ten points. [12]

Table 11.2: Grounds for Censure in [[MN101]] and [[MA19]]

|[[MN101]]|[[MA19]]|
|---|---|
|former deeds (1)<br>creator god (2)<br>company (3)<br>type of life-form (4)<br>present practice (5)|former deeds (→ 1)<br>company (→ 3)<br>type of life-form (→ 4)<br>present practice (→ 5)<br>creator god (→ 2)|



Yet, the actual criticism in both versions covers only five points. After explaining
these five one by one, the Majjhima-nikāya version recapitulates them and indicates
that even in the absence of each of these points the Jains are to be censured. [13] This recapitulation does not yield five additional reasons for criticism, but only a sixth, namely that the Jains are to be censured even in the absence of the five reasons given earlier.
Here the Madhyama-āgama version seems to offer a more coherent presentation, as it
announces and then gives five reasons for censure, while the Majjhima-nikāya version
announces ten but then does not really provide ten reasons.

MN II 223  According to the Devadaha-sutta, after criticizing the fruitless striving of the Jains,
the Buddha explained how striving can be undertaken so as to be fruitful. Fruitful striving, according to the Majjhima-nikāya version, is to exert oneself on occasions that require exertion, but to exercise equanimity on occasions that require equanimity, and
not to give up pleasure that is in accordance with the Dharma.
The Madhyama-āgama discourse instead highlights that the Buddha’s personal knowledge cannot be shaken by anyone in the world. [14] It then indicates that the way to avoid
future dukkha is to give up unwholesome bodily, verbal, and mental deeds, and to undertake their wholesome counterparts. Like the Majjhima-nikāya version, the Madhyama-āgama discourse enjoins not to give up the pleasure that accords with the Dharma.
While the Majjhima-nikāya version recommends exertion or equanimity, depending on
what the situation requires, the Madhyama-āgama version instead enjoins developing
(wholesome) desire or equanimity, [15] a choice that similarly depends on whichever of
these two modes of practice will lead to the eradication of dukkha.

Jains.

To illustrate fruitful exertion followed by equanimity, the Majjhima-nikāya discourse
takes up the example of a man who suffers on seeing the woman he loves conversing
and laughing with another man. Once this man overcomes his affection for the woman,
her behaviour will no longer affect him. The Madhyama-āgama version further develops this image by suggesting that the woman even spent the night with the other man,
something that would indeed further aggravate the suffering of the man who is in love
with her. [16]
The Madhyama-āgama version agrees with the Majjhima-nikāya discourse on describing how a monk strives in such a way as to diminish what is unwholesome and
increase what is wholesome. Once this has been achieved, he will no longer strive, as
his goal has been accomplished. The two versions illustrate this with the example of a
fletcher who no longer works on an arrow that has already been straightened.
The Majjhima-nikāya version next comes out with a full account of the gradual path,
from the arising of a Tathāgata to the attainment of the three higher knowledges. The
Madhyama-āgama version does not have such a full account of the gradual path. Instead, it only depicts how a monk approaches a secluded place, overcomes the five hindrances, develops the four jhānas, and reaches the destruction of the influxes through
knowledge of the four noble truths. [17]
The two versions agree that, if the experience of pleasure and pain were to be attributed to one’s former deeds, to a creator god, to the company one kept, to the type of
one’s life-form, or to one’s present practice, in all cases the Tathāgata should be praised
because of his present experience of influx-free happiness. [18]
While the Majjhima-nikāya discourse concludes at this point, according to the Madhyama-āgama account the Buddha continued by taking up the five hindrances as the five
conditions for the arising of dukkha and their eradication as the condition for freedom

type of desire. An example for in a wholesome sense can be found, e.g., in Xuánzàng’s ( ) rendering of the “desire for wholesome things”, kuśaladharmacchanda� (Abhidh-k 5:16 in Pradhan 1967:
289,1) as, cf. T 1558 at T XXIX 102b8, a rendering similarly employed in T 1579 at T XXX
397a7, the Chinese counterpart to an occurrence of kuśalo dharmacchanda� in the Śrāvakabhūmi in
Shukla 1973: 8,15 or ŚSG 1998: 16,3. On the assumption that in the present context similarly stands
for a wholesome type of desire, the implication of the proposition in [[MA19]] could be to contrast “developing desire [for wholesome things]”,, with “developing equanimity [in regard] to that desire [for
wholesome things]”, .

590   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


[[MN102]] Pañcattaya-sutta [20]

The Pañcattaya-sutta, the “discourse on five and three”, presents a systematic survey
of various views. Parts of this discourse have been preserved in Sanskrit fragments, [21]
while a full parallel is extant in Tibetan. [22] A to a considerable extent comparable examination of various views can also be found in the Brahmajāla-sutta and its counterparts. [23]

MN II 228  The Pañcattaya-sutta and its parallels begin by distinguishing between five and three
types of view. The five types of view cover the assertions:

       - after death the self will be percipient,

       - after death the self will be non-percipient,

       - after death the self will be neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient,

       - at death the self will be annihilated,

       - Nirvā�a in the present life.

20 Be-MN III 17,29 notes Pañcāyatana-sutta as a variant reading for the title, for other title variations cf.
Schlingloff 1961: 34 notes 19 and 20.
21 The fragment parallels are SHT IV 32 folios 1-6 (pp. 109-110), SHT IV 33 folios 1-7 (pp. 155-158, cf.
also SHT VII p. 233), Hoernle fragments 149/187, 149/Add.49, 149/Add.154, and two Hoernle fragments without numbering, edited as no. 125, 126, 127, 128, and 131 in Hartmann 1991: 221-227 and
233-234 (no. 125 corresponds to Or. 15009/321 in Fukita 2009: 306, no. 127 corresponds to Or. 15009/
148 in Kudo 2009: 196). A detailed correlation of these fragments with the Pañcattaya-sutta can be
found in Skilling 1997a: 500-504. Another as yet unpublished parallel to [[MN102]] is fragment 299v3306r5 of the newly discovered Dīrgha-āgama manuscript (I am indebted to Jens-Uwe Hartmann for
kindly providing me with a preliminary draft transliteration of this fragment). Wille 2005: 8 lists SHT
III 882b as another possible parallel (on which cf. also SHT IX p. 403 and SHT X p. 416). The (Mūla-)
Sarvāstivādins allocated their version of the present discourse to their Dīrgha-āgama collection, cf.
Hartmann 1994: 327 and id. 2000: 367. SHT IV 32 folio 1V1 locates the discourse at Śrāvastī, as does
the Tibetan version in Skilling 1994a: 310,4.
22 The parallel is the mdo chen po lnga gsum pa zhes bya ba, translated by Jinamitra, Prajñāvarman, and
Ye shes sde, edited in Skilling 1994a: 310-382, with a detailed study in Skilling 1997a: 469-511. As
noted by Skilling 1997a: 14, the Tibetan parallel to the Pañcattaya-sutta stems from the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda tradition. In what follows, I have greatly benefited from Skilling’s exemplary comparative
study of the Pañcattaya-sutta. Although in a few instances I hope to be able to offer an additional perspective, nevertheless, readers would be well advised if they were to turn to Skilling’s original study for
a more detailed and complete treatment than I am able to give to the Pañcattaya-sutta and its Tibetan
parallel within the context of my study of the Majjhima-nikāya collection as a whole. The same also
holds for my studies of the Cū�a- and Mahāsuññata-suttas ([[MN121]] and [[MN122]]), where a detailed
comparative study can be found in Skilling 1997a: 335-400. For a discourse quotation in Abhidh-k-� cf.
below note 40.
23 [[DN1]] at DN I 12-46, [[DA21]] at T I 89c-94a, T 21 at T I 266a-270c, and the Tibetan discourse (together
with a Mongolian translation) in Weller 1934, translations of the Dīrgha-āgama and Tibetan discourses
can be found in Weller 1971 and Weller 1935. Further parallels, not taken into account in the present
context, are a discourse quotation of the exposition on views found in the Śāriputrābhidharma, T 1548
at T XXVIII 656b-661a, and a quotation of the entire discourse in Śamathadeva’s commentary on the
Abhidharmakośabhā�ya, D (4094) mnong pa, ju 141b-153b or Q (5595) tu 162b-177b, cf. also Anālayo
2009o. Notably, while the treatment of [[DA21]] at T I 89c24 speaks of “views”,, [[DN1]] at DN I 39,14
and the Tibetan version in Weller 1934: 14,33 instead speak of “grounds [for views]”, vatthu or gzhi.

These five types of view are then subsumed under three main categories by speaking
of views that propose:

 - a self that survives after death, [24]

 - a self that is annihilated,

 - Nirvā�a in the present life. [25]
The analysis in terms of “five and three” thus provides two complementary perspectives on these views. The first of these perspectives singles out five main modes of asserting a self. The second perspective then takes up the same five types from the viewpoint of three different future time periods, distinguishing between views concerned
with what will happen after death, at death, or before death (see table 11.3). [26]


Table 11.3: Analysis of Views in [[MN102]] and its Parallels

|survival of percipient self<br>survival of non-percipient self<br>survival of neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient self|after death<br>after death<br>after death|
|---|---|
|annihilation of self|at death|
|Nirvā1a here and now|before death|



The Pañcattaya-sutta takes up the first of the five types of view, concerned with a
self that is percipient after death, by listing altogether eight variations of such a self. Its
Tibetan counterpart does not have two out of these eight variations, as it does not mention the material-and-immaterial self and the neither-material-nor-immaterial self. [27]
The Brahmajāla-sutta and its Chinese and Tibetan counterparts agree in this respect
with the Pañcattaya-sutta, as they include a percipient self that is material-and-immaterial and a percipient self that is neither-material-nor-immaterial in their examination
of various types of self that are percipient after death. [28]


24 Skilling 1997a: 480 highlights a principal difference between the Pāli and Tibetan versions in regard to
the various types of self that survive after death, which [[MN102]] at MN II 228,14 qualifies as “unimpaired”, aroga (literally “healthy”), a qualification not found in its Tibetan counterpart. Schrader 1902:
9 note 2 draws attention to a similar qualification used in the Jain Sūyaga�[[AN1.1]].3.15 cf. Vaidya 1928:

also absent from the Sanskrit version, as, after listing material and immaterial types of self, DĀ (Skt)
fragments 299v8 and 300v3 continue with a type of self that has a unitary perception, a category that in
[[MN102]] comes after the neither-material-nor-immaterial type of self, cf. MN II 229,8.

592   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


The Pañcattaya-sutta and its Sanskrit and Tibetan parallels agree in mentioning selves
that have “limited” or “immeasurable” perceptions. [29] To this the Tibetan version adds a
self whose perceptions have “become great”. [30]
The Pāli version’s list of percipient selves next mentions the consciousness kasi�a. [31]
The Tibetan version speaks instead of the “sphere” of infinite consciousness. [32] According to the Pāli commentary, the reference to the consciousness kasi�a in the present context indeed intends the sphere of infinite consciousness. [33]

30 Skilling 1994a: 314,17: ’du shes chen por gyur pa which, as Skilling 1997a: 484 notes, would correspond
to mahāggatasaññī or mahadgatasa�jñī. In the discourses, the qualifications “immeasurable” and “become great” often function as near synonyms, cf., e.g., the standard description of the meditative radiation of the brahmavihāras, e.g., in [[MN7]] at MN I 38,23: mahaggatena appamā�ena and in its parallel
[[MA93]] at T I 575c13: “very great, boundless”, ; cf. also a description of such radiation in the
Mahāparinirvā�a-sūtra, fragment 362 folio 167V5 in Waldschmidt 1950: 59: mahadgaten-āpra(mā�ena). For an examination of how these two terms differ when applied to “liberation of the mind”, cetovimutti, cf. [[MN127]] at MN III 146,13 and its parallel [[MA79]] at T I 550a9. As [[MN102]] and its Tibetan
parallel describe views on a percipient self by working through pairs of opposites, once a contrast to
“limited” has been provided by “immeasurable”, it seems redundant to bring in additionally a self whose
perceptions have “become great”. The reference to mahāggatasaññī or mahadgatasa�jñī precedes appamā�asaññī or apramā�asa�jñī and thus conforms to the sequence found when these two terms are
listed together in contexts like the brahmavihāra meditation. Perhaps mahāggatasaññī or mahadgatasa�jñī originally stood merely in apposition to appamā�asaññī or apramā�asa�jñī and only later came
to be a separate item. 甚大, 無量

33 Ps IV 18,7. Mp II 77,4 explains that the expression viññā�akasi�a is used in relation to the object, not in
relation to the attainment itself, since the development of the consciousness kasi�a takes infinite consciousness as the object and thereby reaches the sphere of infinite consciousness. It is perhaps noteworthy that
the detailed treatment of the kasi�as in Vism 118-177 does not cover the consciousness kasi�a, although
the same term occurs at Vism 609,15 as part of a list of objects for insight, abhiññā (being a quote from
Pa�is I 6,30). [[BU-AS186.16]] explains that the consciousness kasi�a is not included in the exposition of kasi�as because it belongs to the development of the immaterial attainments. Nett 89,26 associates the space
kasi�a and the consciousness kasi�a with the realm of insight, vipassanā, while the other eight kasi�as
are samatha meditation objects. Yet, the reason for the absence of the consciousness kasi�a in the Visuddhimagga’s treatment may rather be that, once the expression kasi�a is taken to stand for a particular
meditation device, it becomes difficult to imagine what a consciousness kasi�a might be. The consciousness kasi�a occurs regularly in the Pāli discourses in a list of ten “kasi�a spheres”, kasi�āyata�as, cf.,
e.g., [[DN33]] at DN III 268,25, [[DN34]] at DN III 290,16, [[MN77]] at MN II 15,1, [[AN10.25]] at AN V 46,8,
and [[AN10.29]] at AN V 60,21. [[AN1.150]] at AN I 41,23 also lists the consciousness kasi�a, without, however, introducing it as a kasi�āyata�a. [[AN10.26]] at AN V 47,15 speaks of the viññā�akasi�asamāpatti.
[[SA549]] at T II 143a25 (parallel to [[AN10.26]]) speaks of the “consciousness kasi�a sphere”,,
corresponding to the expression vijñānak�tsnāyatana mentioned in the Mahāvyutpatti no. 1538 in Sakaki

Both versions next turn to the “sphere” of nothingness, [34] which they qualify as supreme among perceptions. The Pañcattaya-sutta and its parallels agree that the Tathāgata has understood the conditioned nature of these postulations of a percipient self
after death and gone beyond them.
The Tibetan version presents the next type of view on a self that is not percipient after death as a single view. [35] The Pāli version takes up the same view in a fourfold mode
by distinguishing between material, immaterial, material-and-immaterial, and neithermaterial-nor-immaterial manifestations of such a self. [36]
The Brahmajāla-sutta and its Chinese and Tibetan counterparts take their analysis
even further, as they present views about a non-percipient self in altogether eight variations, by additionally taking up the four possibilities that such a self could be limited,
unlimited, both, or neither. [37]
The same difference recurs in the examination of a self that is neither-percipient-nornon-percipient, which the Tibetan parallel to the Pañcattaya-sutta presents as a single
proposal, while the Pañcattaya-sutta offers a fourfold presentation. [38] The Brahmājalasutta and its parallels explore eight variations of this type of self. [39]


1926: 123. [[MA215]] at T I 800b7 (parallel to [[AN10.29]]) and the Sa�gītiparyāya, T 1536 at T XXVI
447b9, present the “consciousness kasi�a”,, as the tenth of the “kasi�a spheres”, or .
The alternative expression “consciousness sphere k�tsna”, vijñānā(na�tyāyatanak�tsna), occurs, e.g., in
SHT III 915R3 (p. 171, the restoration is corroborated by the immediately preceding (ākāśāna�)[t]yāyatanak�tsna�), cf. also fragment X 679V4 in Stache-Rosen 1968: 34 and fragment 689R3 in Schlingloff 1962a: 14. Ān Shìgāo’s ( ) translation of the Daśottara-sūtra speaks merely of the “consciousness kasi�a”, T 13 at T I 241b7:, further qualified as “pervasive above and below, non-dual,
and immeasurable”, . These different renderings throw into relief the close relationship between the all-pervasive nature of the attainment of the sphere of infinite consciousness and the
expression kasi�a or k�tsna in the sense of a “totality”; cf. also Barnes 1981: 248, who highlights the
basic meaning of kasi�a or k�tsna as “‘whole’ or ‘entire’”. This not only corroborates the similarity in
meaning between the expressions “consciousness 識遍 kasi�a” and “sphere of infinite consciousness 一切處 ” 遍處, but
also indicates that in the early discourses kasi�a or k�tsna stood for the all-pervasive totality that characterizes such experiences, for developing of which the meditation devices described in the commentaries are merely the tools. Vetter 1988: 66-67 comments that “in the Visuddhimagga we no longer find
that a Kasina sphere is considered as being immeasurable. It is even characteristic of the technique that 安世高
one first concentrates on a limited” object, wherefore 識普 “the Visuddhimagga is consistent in substituting
the last two instances of the old Kasina series ... by concentration on (a limited amount of) light and a 上下 遍不二無有量
limited space”; cf. also Anālayo 2009t and Wynne 2007: 31-34.

In view of the use of “sphere” at this point in all versions, the Tibetan version’s earlier usage of “sphere” in relation to consciousness seems more in conformity with the remainder of the discourse than the Pāli version’s reference to the consciousness “kasi�a”,
cf. above notes 31 and 32.

594   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


The Pañcattaya-sutta and its Tibetan parallel indicate that those who advocate a nonpercipient self after death confront those who propose a percipient self after death with
the criticism that perception is a disease. [40] Those who advocate a self that is neitherpercipient-nor-non-percipient challenge the proponents of a non-percipient self after
death with the criticism that the absence of perception is a state of delusion. [41] The two
versions agree with the Sanskrit fragments that it is impossible for consciousness to arise
apart from the other aggregates. [42]
The Pāli version rejects the belief that the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception can be attained through what is seen, heard, sensed, and cognised, as this sphere
can only be attained with a mere residue of formations. [43] The implications of this passage are less clear in the Tibetan version, which in addition to what is seen, heard,
sensed, and cognised, also brings in such topics as morality and discipline, celibacy,
and ascetic practices. [44]
The Tibetan version qualifies the attainment of neither-perception-nor-non-perception as the pinnacle of existence. [45] Although the Pañcattaya-sutta does not make this
point, a discourse in the A�guttara-nikāya similarly classifies the realm that corre

The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā(upadeśa-)śāstra, T 1509 at T XXV 63c17 (in a quote of a version of [[SNP839]]) also combines what is

sponds to the attainment of neither-perception-nor-non-perception as the pinnacle of
existence. [46]
The Pañcattaya-sutta next turns to annihilationism. While the Pāli version presents
annihilationism as a single proposal, the Tibetan version offers a more detailed analysis,
as it distinguishes between seven possible instances of this view. [47] The Brahmajālasutta and its Chinese and Tibetan parallels similarly distinguish between seven variations of annihilationism. [48]
According to the Pañcattaya-sutta and its Tibetan parallel, the annihilationists employ the image of a merchant in their criticism of the various proposals on a self that
survives after death. The two versions reveal that the fear of personality of the annihilationists is their very bondage, [49] a predicament the Pāli version illustrates with the image of a dog that moves in circles around a post to which it is bound. [50]
The Pāli and Tibetan versions next take up sixteen types of view in relation to the
past. [51] The Pāli version precedes this examination by stating that at this point the five
types of proposal about the future have been examined. [52] Although this statement corresponds to the introductory proclamation at the beginning of the discourse, in which
the Pañcattaya-sutta announces five modes of positing a self in relation to the future, [53]
both versions have so far covered only four modes:

 - a percipient self,

 - a non-percipient self,

 - a self that is neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient,

 - annihilationism.
This point deserves further exploration, as it is of relevance to the overall structure of
the Pañcattaya-sutta and its Tibetan parallel.
The Pāli commentary explains that views on “Nirvā�a in the present life” should be

nation is questionable, as there seems to be no reason why these two views should be
identified with “Nirvā�a in the present life”.
The Brahmajāla-sutta and its Chinese and Tibetan parallels take up views on “Nirvā�a in the present life” as a topic on its own, without relating it in any way to views
on a self that is percipient of unity or diversity after death. [55] This suggests that views
on “Nirvā�a in the present life” would require a separate treatment and have not been
implicitly covered by views on a self that is percipient of unity or diversity after death.
After surveying the sixteen types of view in relation to the past, the Pañcattaya-sutta
and its Tibetan parallel do take up the jhānas and misconceptions about having attained
Nirvā�a. The Pañcattaya-sutta’s examination of the jhānas and of misconceptions about
having attained Nirvā�a might correspond to the fifth of the types of view announced
in the introduction to the same discourse, to views on “Nirvā�a in the present life”. [56] In
fact, views in relation to the jhānas make up four out of the five views on “Nirvā�a in
the present life” in the Brahmajāla-sutta and its parallels. [57] The same heading would
all the more fit mistaken notions of Nirvā�a, the last item examined in the Pañcattayasutta and its Tibetan parallel. Moreover, the Tibetan version and the Sanskrit fragments
agree in explicitly introducing this section as an examination of views on “Nirvā�a in
the present life”. [58]
A problem with this classification is that the Pāli and the Tibetan versions introduce
their examination of the jhānas and mistaken notions about Nirvā�a by mentioning that
views about past and future have been relinquished. [59] How could views on “Nirvā�a in
the present life”, classified in the Pañcattaya-sutta’s introductory section as types of
view that are related to the future, correspond to what both versions of the present passage introduce as something based on having overcome views about the future?
A solution to this problem might be found in a minor change in terminology in the
Pañcattaya-sutta and its parallel. When presenting the five and three modes of views,
the Pāli and Tibetan versions speak of “views” and “thoughts” in relation to the future. [60]

60 In its introduction and again at the end of its examination of the five and three types of view, [[MN102]] at
MN II 228,12 and MN II 233,7 speaks of “thinking about the future, having views about the future”, aparantakappikā aparantānudi��hino. Although the Tibetan version does not have this specification in its
introductory section (cf. Skilling 1994a: 312,1 and also the discussion in Skilling 1997a: 476), it does


Chapter 11 Devadaha-vagga                                    -  597


When introducing their treatment of jhāna and mistaken notions of Nirvā�a, the same
versions speak only of overcoming “views” about past and future, without mentioning
“thoughts”. [61]
Although one would think that “views” and “thoughts” are simply used as near equivalents, the absence of a reference to “thoughts” in the present passage could perhaps
indicate that whereas the first four modes – concerned with a percipient self, a non-percipient self, a self that is neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient, and a self that will be
annihilated – can be reckoned as full-fledged “views”, the two versions of the present
discourse no longer consider the fifth mode of “Nirvā�a in the present life” as a full
fledged instance of “views”, but only as “thoughts” or ways of “reasoning” concerned
with the future. That is, although at the present junction “views” in relation to the future
have been overcome, the same may not yet be the case for “thoughts” about the future.
The assumption that “Nirvā�a in the present life” should indeed be assigned to the
future finds support in the Brahmajāla-sutta and in its Chinese and Tibetan parallels, all
of which place their examination of “Nirvā�a in the present life” under the category of
thoughts and views related to the future. [62]
Moreover, the sequence of the treatment found in the Brahmajāla-sutta and its Chinese and Tibetan parallels suggest that an examination of views about the past should
precede views about the future. [63] Taking a lead from the Brahmajāla-sutta’s sequence,
perhaps the section on views about the past in the Pañcattaya-sutta should also precede
the exposition of views about the future. On the assumption that the section on views
about the past originally could have stood right at the beginning of the discourse and
might then accidentally have been shifted to the wrong place during the course of the
discourse’s transmission, much of the difficulties noted so far could be resolved.
This would, however, imply that the statement on the “five and three” was not an introduction to the discourse as a whole, but only to its examination of views and thoughts
related to the future. This is indeed the case in the Pāli version, which specifies the five
and three to be concerned with the future. [64] As an introduction to the discourse as a

The Tibetan parallel to the Brahmajāla-sutta thus only takes account of the first of the two terms found in the Pāli version, the “thoughts related to the future” (rtog pa corresponds to kappana or kalpana). The Chinese rendering indicates that its Indic original had both terms, although the translator(s) seems to have mistaken
kappika for kappa or kalpa, resulting in a reference to “aeons”.
63 As Skilling 1997a: 483 note 39 indicates, the order found in the Pañcattaya-sutta, where views on the
future precede views on the past, “is unusual, the established tradition in Buddhist literature being past,
future, present”.

whole this would not fit, as it does not take the sixteen types of view concerned with
the past into account.
While the general treatment of views in the two Pañcattaya-suttas is relatively similar to the Brahmajāla-sutta and its parallels, the analysis of views about the future into
“five and three” is a peculiarity of the present discourse. [65] This peculiarity has led to
the discourse’s title in the Pāli and Tibetan versions. References in other works also regularly employ the same title. [66] Sanskrit fragments suggest, however, that the present
discourse might also have been known under a different title. [67] As discourse titles can
at times be late, [68] the title “five and three” could have come into being after the analysis into “five and three” had come to stand at the beginning part of the discourse.
In sum, on the assumption that the sequence in the Pañcattaya-sutta’s treatment may
have been affected during the process of transmission, the discourse could have originally started with an examination of various views about the past, [69] followed by views
about the future. The topic of views about the future would have begun by analysing
them into “five and three”, [70] without, however, identifying this analysis as a summary
to the whole discourse. [71] After views on a self that survives after death and views on


65 The fivefold presentation of views recurs in Vibh 378,16.
66 Skilling 1997a: 471 notes several references to the present discourse, all of which revolve around the
idea of “five and three”, such as lnga gsum pa, lnga dang gsum, and lnga pa dang gsum pa. References
in Chinese works (noted by Skilling 1997a: 471 and by Yìnshùn 1971/1983: 578) similarly reflect the
idea of “five and three”, cf. the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, T 1442 at T XXIII 662a29 and T 1443 at T
XXIII 925c6:, the *Mahāvibhā�ā, T 1545 at T XXVII 660a28:, and the, T
380 at T XII 971b18: . The Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, T 1435 at T XXIII 174b19, opts for a transcription as, incorrectly glossed as “Samādhi-sūtra”, .
67 Cf. the discussion in SHT IV p. 7 and Schlingloff 1961: 34.
68 Cf. above pp. 106, 123, and 468.
69 This is the section that begins with [[MN102]] at MN II 233,10: “monks, there are some recluses and Brahmins who think about the past and hold views about the past”, santi, bhikkhave, eke sama�abrāhma�a
pubbantakappikā pubbantānudi��hino, until MN II 235,7: “the Tathāgata has gone beyond that”, tathāgato tad upātivatto, corresponding to §§ 14 to 16 in Ñā�amoli 1995/2005: 842-844.
70 This would be the part from the beginning of the actual discourse in [[MN102]] at MN II 228,12: “monks,
there are some recluses and Brahmins who think about the future and hold views about the future 增五增三經 五三經 大悲經 ”, santi, bhikkhave, eke sama�abrāhma�a aparantakappikā aparantānudi��hino 五三法, until the conclusion of the
examination of the annihilationist views at MN II 233, 般闍提利劍 6 with: 三昧經 “the Tathāgata has gone beyond that”, tathāgato tad upātivatto, corresponding to §§ 1 to 12 in Ñā�amoli 1995/2005: 839-842.
71 That is, for my reconstruction to work, I need to assume that the identification of the introduction to
views on the future as the “summary” to the discourse as a whole ([[MN102]] at MN II 228,23: ayam uddeso pañcattayassa, with its Tibetan counterpart lnga gsum pa’i chos kyi rnam grangs mdor bstan pa
yin no in Skilling 1994a: 314,4) does not belong to the original discourse, but was added by the reciters.
A similar statement can also be found in the Majjhima-nikāya in discourses [[MN137]] at MN III 216,7,
[[MN139]] at MN III 230,21, and [[MN140]] at MN III 239,15. In each of these three instances, the expression aya� uddeso is preceded by iti, which indicates that the part spoken by the Buddha ends before this
remark. That is, the identification of the Buddha’s brief explanation as an uddesa to the discourse is a
reciter’s remark. The Chinese parallels to these three discourses, [[MA163]] at T I 692c4, [[MA169]] at T I
701c6, and [[MA162]] at T I 690b27, do not conclude their corresponding introductory section by identify

Chapter 11 Devadaha-vagga                                    -  599


annihilationism, the discourse would then have continued by examining the jhānas and
mistaken notions of Nirvā�a.
In this way, the treatment would have covered the item mentioned as fifth among the
“five and three”, which is “Nirvā�a in the present life”. [72] Once this fifth item has been
covered, the exposition of views or thoughts related to the future would be concluded,
so that at this point the concluding statement to this exposition would come in its right
place, [73] followed by the conclusion to the discourse as a whole. [74]
Returning to the content of the exposition given in the Pañcattaya-sutta and its Tibetan parallel, regarding the sixteen views about the past, the two versions agree in presenting the possibility that the self and the world may be eternal or not eternal in altogether four modes, based on the tetralemma scheme.
The Pāli version applies the same tetralemma scheme to the theme of the finiteness
of the self and the world, and to the proposition that the self and the world experience
only pleasure. In addition to the eight views that result from applying the tetralemma to

ing it as a summary. This would support the impression that in the case of the Pañcattaya-sutta and its
Tibetan parallel the remark aya� uddeso or mdor bstan pa yin no could also be a reciter’s remark added
to the discourse at some point during its transmission. Such a remark could only have been added to the
Pañcattaya-sutta at a time when what I assume to be the original sequence had already changed and the
introduction to views about the future had come to the beginning of the whole discourse. If, on the other
hand, one were to take the uddesa statement as part of the original version, then the Pañcattaya-sutta
should only be concerned with the “five and three” and not cover views related to the past at all. That is,
on following the uddesa statement one would need to conclude that the whole exposition on views concerned with the past has been added later. Skilling 1997a: 483 explores this possibility, suggesting that
perhaps “the list of views pertaining to the foretime belonged to an oral commentary on this passage,
and that at some point the list was absorbed into the text, whether unconsciously or through the action of
a zealous and methodical editor”, cf. also Pérez-remón 1978: 82 note 46 for a similar suggestion. Although this fits better with the uddesa found in both versions, a problem with his suggestion would be
that the Pāli and Tibetan versions introduce their examination of the jhānas and of mistaken notions of
Nirvā�a by speaking of relinquishing views about past and about the future. This suggests views about
the past to be an integral part of the Pañcattaya-sutta’s examination. Moreover, the Pañcattaya-sutta
culminates in presenting unsurpassable liberation as the transcendence of all views. As such transcendence goes beyond views related to past and future, the theme of the discourse receives a comprehensive treatment only when views concerned with the past are also taken into account.
72 This is the section that begins in [[MN102]] at MN II 235,8: “here, monks, some recluse or Brahmin, having relinquished views about the past and having relinquished views about the future”, idha, bhikkhave,
ekacco sama�o vā brāhma�o pubbantānudi��hīnañ ca pa�inissagga aparantānudi��hīnañ ca pa�inissagga, corresponding to §§17 to 24 in Ñā�amoli 1995/2005: 844-846.
73 This would be the concluding statement about views and thoughts related to the future, found in [[MN102]]
at MN II 233,7-10: “monks, whatever recluses or Brahmins who think about the future or have views
about the future ... they all assert these five ways [lit.: spheres] or any one out of them”, ye hi keci, bhikkhave, sama�ā vā brāhma�a vā aparantakappikā aparantānudi��hino ... sabbe te imān’ eva pañc’ āyatanāni abhivadanti, etesa� vā aññatara�, corresponding to § 13 in Ñā�amoli 1995/2005: 842.
74 This would be the section from [[MN102]] at MN II 237,28: “monks, this supreme state of peace has been
realized by the Tathāgata”, ida� kho pana, bhikkhave, tathāgatena anuttara� santivarapada� abhisambuddha� (S [e] -MIII 40,11: santa� vara� pada�), until the delighted reaction of the monks at MN II
238,5, corresponding to § 25 in Ñā�amoli 1995/2005: 846.


600   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


these two topics, it also presents the two views that the self and the world could be percipient of unity or diversity, and the two views that they could be of limited or immeasurable perception.
None of these altogether twelve views occurs in the Tibetan version. The Pāli version’s
presentation of these views in the present context is in fact puzzling, since a self with a
unitary or a diverse perception, as well as a self with a limited or an immeasurable perception, have already been covered under views related to the future. Although the formulation is slightly different in as much as the present instance includes not only the
“self” but also the “world” in its treatment, this difference would not seem sufficient
for assigning such views to the past instead of the future.
The Brahmajāla-sutta and its Chinese and Tibetan parallels assign views on a self
with a unitary or a diverse perception and views on a self with a limited or an immeasurable perception to views related to the future. The same is the case for the four views
on a self that is finite or infinite and for the four views on a self that experiences pleasure or pain. [75] That is, the twelve views in the Pāli Pañcattaya-sutta that are not found
in its Tibetan counterpart should according to the Pāli, Chinese, and Tibetan versions
of the Brahmajāla-sutta indeed not be reckoned as views about the past, but rather as
views concerned with the future.
In addition to the four views on the past found in common in the Pañcattaya-sutta
and in its parallel, the Tibetan discourse applies the tetralemma scheme to the views
that the self and the world are due to one’s own deeds or another’s, that self and dukkha are eternal or not eternal, and that self and dukkha are caused by one’s own or another’s deeds. [76] The Sanskrit fragments have preserved part of a similar exposition. [77]
The Pāsādika-sutta of the Dīgha-nikāya takes up the same set of views, confirming that
they are indeed to be reckoned as related to the past. [78]

MN II 234  The Pañcattaya-sutta and its Tibetan parallel point out that such statements about the
past are not the outcome of personal realization, but merely depend on faith, liking,
oral tradition, reasoning, or acceptance of a view. [79]

the exposition given to views about the past in the Tibetan parallel to the Pañcattaya-sutta fits the context better than the Pāli version.

Skilling 1997a: 492 draws attention to a difference in formulation, as [[MN102]] at MN II 234,14 identifies

Both versions next turn to jhāna experiences, which they present in a threefold manner
by distinguishing between the “bliss of seclusion”, “unworldly pleasure”, and “neutral
feeling”, a threefold presentation found also in the Sanskrit fragments. [80] The Pāli commentary explains that “bliss of seclusion” stands for the first and the second jhāna, “unworldly pleasure” for the third jhāna, and “neutral feeling” for the fourth jhāna. [81]
The Pāli and Tibetan discourses examine what takes place when such experiences
cease, at which point they will be replaced by a coarser state of mind. Thus, when the
bliss of seclusion ceases, sadness will take its place, a situation both versions illustrate
with the alteration between sunshine and shadow. [82]
While the Pāli version continues to use the same image, the Tibetan discourse offers
different similes for the other two cases, comparing the fluctuation between unworldly
pleasure and the bliss of seclusion to the fluctuations of water, which rises and descends,
followed by illustrating the shift from neutral feeling to unworldly pleasure to a stick
thrown up into space, which may fall on its side or on its tip. [83]
The two versions next examine a recluse or Brahmin who assumes he has attained
Nirvā�a. According to both versions, this recluse believes himself to be free from attachment, to which the Tibetan version adds that he claims to be without craving, a
claim also preserved in the Sanskrit fragment parallel. [84]
According to the Tibetan version, this recluse thinks he no longer has the self he had
earlier. [85] This last specification involves a thorough misunderstanding on the side of
this recluse. Such a misunderstanding would not be possible for a disciple in higher

the holding of such views to be an instance of “clinging”, upādāna, while its Tibetan counterpart in
Skilling 1994a: 350,13 instead indicates the holding of such views to be a manifestation of “lack of
knowledge”, mi shes pa, a reading supported by the Sanskrit fragment Hoernle 149/187V4, no. 127 in

training (sekha), who by dint of realizing stream-entry would know that there has never
been a self in the first place. In this way, in the Tibetan version it is self-evident why
this recluse’s claim to realization can be dismissed as thoroughly mistaken.
In the Pāli version, the problem with this recluse seems to be rather the self-centeredness inherent in his claim formulated in terms of ‘I’ have attained peace, ‘I’ have attained Nirvā�a. The commentary explains this claim to be a manifestation of conceit,
the presence of which would indeed contradict a claim to full awakening. [86]
Thus, whereas in the Tibetan version the claim to have attained Nirvā�a is made by
someone who has not yet arrived at any insight into the absence of a self, the Pāli version only indicates that the claim to having attained Nirvā�a is made by someone who
has not yet reached full awakening, with which even the last trace of conceit will be
left behind.
The Tibetan version highlights that this recluse is on the path of attachment and grasping. [87] According to the Pāli version, however, this recluse asserts the path that leads to
Nirvā�a. [88] These different statements reflect the basic difference in perspective on the
level of development of the recluse in the two versions.
According to the Tibetan version, this recluse thought that he had been able to get rid
of a self he had earlier. That is, he is still holding the view of a self, a view that indeed
constitutes the path of attachment and grasping.
From the viewpoint of the Pāli discourse, however, the recluse only affirms to be at
peace, to have attained Nirvā�a, and to be without attachment. The attainment of peace
and freedom from attachment recur right away in the next paragraph in the Pāli version
in the Buddha’s proclamation to have reached unsurpassable liberation. [89]
The same qualities also form part of a recurrent maxim in the discourses, which
qualifies the attainment of Nirvā�a as peaceful and associates it with a series of epithets that stand for the eradication of all attachment. [90] According to the Mahāmālu�kya-sutta, this maxim is in fact part of the ‘path’ to the overcoming of the five lover


86 Ps IV 27,4 suggests that this recluse’s claim is made with abhimāna, “excessive conceit”; cf. also Collins
1982: 122, who comments that the passage reveals the presence of “a form of attachment ... because the
claim is still phrased in terms of ‘I’”.

89 According to [[MN102]] at MN II 237,28, the Buddha spoke of having reached the “unsurpassable state of
peace”, anuttara� santivarapada� (S [e] -MIII 40,11: santa� vara� pada�), and the “liberation through
absence of attachment”, anupādā vimokkho, terminology similar to the “peace” and the “absence of attachment” claimed by the recluse in [[MN102]] at MN II 237,12.

fetters and thus to non-return or full awakening. [91] As the same discourse indicates, this
maxim stands for inclining the mind toward the deathless element. [92] A discourse in the
A�guttara-nikāya in fact refers to the same as a form of concentration. [93]
Hence, the proposal made by the recluse in the Pañcattaya-sutta, even though based
on an overestimation, in itself would indeed be a path conducive to Nirvā�a, all the
more as it is based on the ability to attain the four jhānas. [94]
The Pañcattaya-sutta and its parallels conclude by describing the Buddha’s attainment of total liberation, thereby highlighting what goes beyond any of the views and
positions examined in this discourse.


[[MN103]] Kinti-sutta

The Kinti-sutta, the “discourse on ‘what then?’”, sets out ways to settle disagreements about the teachings and how to handle another monk’s misbehaviour. Of this
discourse, so far no parallel appears to have been identified.


[[MN104]] Sāmagāma-sutta

The Sāmagāma-sutta, the “discourse at Sāmagāma”, explains how the monks can
avoid quarrels among each other after the Buddha’s demise. This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama and another parallel in an individual translation. [95]


91 [[MN64]] at MN I 435,26: maggo ... pa�ipadā pañcanna� orambhāgiyāna� sa�yojanāna� pahānāya (CeMN II 168,27 and S [e] -MII 159,10: saññyojanāna�).
92 [[MN64]] at MN I 435,36: amatāya dhātuyā citta� upasa�harati. A similar type of practice is described in
Vism 293,6 under the heading “recollection of peace”, upasamānussati.
93 [[AN5.31]] at AN I 133,4: samādhipa�ilābho.
94 With this suggestion I venture to differ from Skilling 1997a: 495, who comments: “can a statement made
by someone who is attached - a statement itself described as a manifestation of attachment - refer to the
‘practice conducive to nibbāna’ ... when the statement itself does not describe any practice, but only a
deluded assertion of attainment?”.
95 The parallels are [[MA196]] at T I 752c-755c and T 85 at T I 904c-907a. [[MA196]] has the title “discourse
to Cunda”,, while T 85 has the title “discourse spoken by the Buddha on the conditions for appeasing quarrels”, . According to the information given in the Taishō edition, T 85 was
translated by Dānapāla ( ). [[MA196]] and T 85 agree with [[MN104]] on locating the discourse at the
village Sāmagāma ( or ). While [[MN104]] at MN II 243,16 places Sāmagāma
among the Sakyans, according to [[MA196]] at T I 752c12 Sāmagāma was rather among the Vajjians,
. Anesaki 1908: 58 reasons that as “Pāvā, where Jina died, gave the occasion to this discourse ... it
seems more probable that Sāmagāma was near Pāvā”, thereby taking [[MA196]] to be correct in locating
Sāmagāma in the Vajjian country. Yet, with Pāvā in the Malla country as the starting point, it seems
equally possible for Cunda to depart in the direction of the Vajjian country or in the opposite direction
of the Sakyan country to deliver the news of the death of the Niga��ha leader. Thus, the fact that Cunda
came from Pāvā does not imply that Sāmagāma should be located among the Vajjians. Sāmagāma re- 周那經
curs in [[DN29]] at DN III 118, 佛說息諍因緣經 7 and in [[AN6.21]] at AN III 309,1. [[AN6.21]] explicitly locates Sāmagāma in
the Sakyan country, while 施護 [[DN29]] does the same implicitly, since its reports that Cunda met Ānanda at

MN II 244  The Sāmagāma-sutta and its parallels record in similar terms that Cunda had approached Ānanda to report a quarrel that had broken out among the Jains, [96] after their
leader had passed away. [97] On hearing Cunda’s account, Ānanda decided to convey this
news to the Buddha. [98]

MN II 245   According to the Sāmagāma-sutta, the Buddha told Ānanda that a dispute about the
path to awakening would indeed be a serious matter. [99] In contrast, a dispute about matters of conduct would be of less significance. [100]


Sāmagāma, after which the two monks approached the Buddha, who according to [[DN29]] at DN III 117,2
was living among the Sakyans. The parallel to [[DN29]] [[DA17]] at T I 72c13+16, does not mention Sāmagāma, although it reports that Ānanda and the Buddha were staying in the park of the Vedhaññas near
Kapilavatthu, thereby confirming that the whole event took place in the Sakyan country ([[AN6.21]] does
not appear to have a parallel). These discourses would support the indication given in [[MN104]] that Sāmagāma should be located in the Sakyan country. For remarks on [[MA196]] cf. Minh Chau 1964/1991: 87
and 176-180.
96 [[DN29]] at DN III 118,11 and [[DA17]] at T I 72c17 also record that the novice Cunda approached Ānanda
to report the quarrel that had broke out among the Jains after the death of their leader; cf. also Gethin
1992a: 232-234. The same quarrel among the Jains stands at the background of [[DN33]] at DN III 210,18
and its parallel [[DA9]] at DN I 49c6 (translated in Behrsing 1930: 1-2 and Watanabe 1993: 180), with a
Sanskrit counterpart in fragment K 484 (11)Rc in Stache-Rosen 1968: 17 (cf. also Schmidt 1997: 304)
and in Waldschmidt 1955: 311-314, which indicate that the rationale for the delivery of this discourse
was to prevent the arising of such a quarrel in the Buddhist community. Tilakaratne 2000a: 189 notes
that the underlying purpose of the Sa�gīti-sutta as a communal recitation is to function as an expression
of harmony within the monastic community, expressed in [[DN33]] at DN III 211,3 with the injunction
that “all should recite together and not dispute, so that this holy life may endure and remain for a long
time”, sabbeh’ eva sa�gāyitabba� na vivaditabba� yathayida� brahmacariya� addhaniya� assa cira��hitika�, a purpose mentioned in similar terms also in [[DA9]] at T I 49c18. Keith 1932: 864 notes that
during the lifetime of Mahāvīra quarrels had broken out in the Jain community already (cf. the surveys
in Deo 1956: 78-84 and von Glasenapp 1925/1999: 383-384), making it not improbable that a dispute
could have happened again after his death. According to Jaini 1980: 84, during subsequent periods of
Indian history “the divisiveness associated with sectarianism was much more severe among Jainas than
among the Buddhists”. In T 85, however, the theme of a quarrel among the Jains seems to shade over
into Jains challenging Buddhist monks.
97 Ps IV 34,17 reports that Niga��ha Nā�aputta had been so affected by the conversion of his disciple Upāli
to Buddhism that he vomited blood (Upāli’s conversion is described in [[MN56]] at MN I 378,30 and its parallel [[MA133]] at T I 630a22, on its effect on Niga��ha Nā�aputta cf. also above p. 333). He had come to
Pāvā to recover from this affliction, where he passed away.
98 A minor difference is that [[MA196]] at T I 753b11 records Ānanda’s worries in detail, relating that he told
the Buddha how on hearing such news he had been terrified and had wondered if a monk, who now behaved respectfully in front of the Buddha, may not on a later occasion, once the Buddha had passed
away, create a similar quarrel in the Buddhist monastic community.
99 Willemen 1998: 169 notes that the summary of the constituents of the path to awakening, given at the
present junction, foreshadows the tendency of employing listings as summaries of teachings, prominent
in Abhidharma literature.
100 [[MN104]] at MN II 245,19: “a dispute about livelihood or about the higher rules would be insignificant.
If in the community a dispute were to arise about the path and the way, such a dispute would be of
harm to many”, appamattako so ... vivādo yadida� ajjhājīve vā adhipātimokkhe vā. magge vā ... pa�ipadāya vā sa�ghe vivādo upajjamāno uppajjeyya, so ’ssa vivādo bahujanāhitāya (B [e] -MN III 33,7 and


Chapter 11 Devadaha-vagga                                    -  605


The parallel versions take up different causes for disputation. While the Sāmagāmasutta directly broaches this subject, the Madhyama-āgama account provides a lead over
to this topic by highlighting that the teacher of the Jains could not have been all-knowing and all-seeing, for if that had been the case he would have taught his disciples these
causes for disputation (and thereby forestalled the arising of quarrels after his death). [101]
While the three versions agree in mentioning such states as anger, envy, and being
deceitful as potential causes for dispute, their listings show some variations (see table
11.4). The Pāli version stands alone in including a contemptuous and domineering attitude as a potential cause for disputation. [102] The two Chinese accounts additionally reckon
the absence of shame and recklessness as qualities that can cause disputation. [103]
The Sāmagāma-sutta and its parallels indicate that, due to the presence of such unwholesome states, a monk will be disrespectful towards the teacher. The individual
translation explains that a monk without respect towards the teacher will not undertake
proper insight contemplation when being in the midst of the assembly, as a result of
which he can easily become disputatious. [104]


S [e] -MIII 51,15: svāssa, S [e] also reads yo instead of so). Dhirasekera 1982/2007: 227 comments that this
statement shows “the relatively secondary importance which the Buddha attached to discipline in its
mere outward form in contrast to the more fundamental teachings of the doctrine and their practice in
the religious life”; cf. also Guruge 1970: 11. According to [[MA196]] at T I 753b27, however, “such disputation would be very small, namely [a disputation] related to the higher morality, the higher mind,
the higher insight”,, which [[MA196]] then contrasts with the
gravity of a dispute related to the path. According to [[AN5.74]] at AN I 235,19+23 and its parallel [[SA817]] at T II 210a28+b1, the training in the higher mind, adhicitta/, stands for the four jhānas,
while the training in higher wisdom, adhipaññā/, stands for penetrative insight into the four noble
truths. Although [[MA196]] speaks of “higher insight”,, instead of “higher wisdom”,, the
two terms are sufficiently similar to allow the conclusion that the higher virtue, higher mind, and higher
insight mentioned in [[MA196]] stand for the three higher trainings. Whether the point at stake is higher
wisdom or higher insight, the present passage in [[MA196]] seems self-contradictory, since it would be
difficult to think of anything apart from the three items it has already mentioned that could be assembled under the heading “related to the path”, . Judging from the formulation in [[MN104]] perhaps
the occurrence of higher virtue misled a reciter into adding the other two higher trainings. Regarding 此鬪諍甚少, 謂因增上戒, 增上心, 增上觀
the reference in both versions to “higher” morality or rules, adhi-/, it may be pertinent to note that,
according to Eimer 1976: 40 note 26, the prefix adhi- in adhisīla (etc.) originally just meant 增上意 that such a
training was undertaken “concerning” or “in regard 增上慧 to” morality (etc.), and it was only later that adhiwas understood to mean “higher”. 增上觀 增上慧

. [[MA196]] at T I 753c16 also refers
to “not seeing the Dharma”,, as one of the reasons for the arising of quarrels in the community,
although it does not draw out the dynamics of its consequences in as detailed a manner as T 85.

MN II 246  The three versions agree in highlighting the need to energetically take action against
such causes for disputation, whether these be found internally or externally, a specification the Pāli commentary explains to stand for oneself and others. [108]
The Chinese versions additionally highlight the need for mindfulness and clear comprehension when taking action against these causes for disputation. The individual
translation points out that a dispute will not be overcome as long as mindfulness and
clear comprehension are lacking. [109]
The Madhyama-āgama discourse illustrates the sense of urgency with which these
causes for dispute should be overcome with a simile. This simile describes a person
whose head or clothes are on fire, a predicament that indeed requires swift action. [110]
Elsewhere this image illustrates the need to overcome unwholesome states of mind. [111]

105 Cf. above p. 51 note 125.
106 [[MA196]] at T I 754a4 adds that such a person is also of an evil nature and unable to restrain himself.
107 T 85 at T I 905b25 speaks of “grasping at views”,, followed by mentioning dogmatic adherence,

, together with erroneous and deluded recollections and thoughts ([[MA196]] does not mention this
particular cause for disputation at all).
108 Ps IV 42,3.
109 T 85 at T I 905b21 explains that as long as “in this way loss of mindfulness and lack of clear comprehension arises ... it will be impossible to eradicate and extinguish the cause of the disputation”,
. [[MA196]] at T I 753c22 similarly recommends the development
of “right mindfulness and right knowledge”,, which it additionally associates with the need
to maintain unremitting patience,, without, however, drawing out the implications of the absence of mindfulness in the way done in T 85.

The Sāmagāma-sutta and its parallels next take up ways to settle litigations. [112] The MN II 247
Pāli discourse precedes this exposition by distinguishing between four types of litigation, a classification not found in its Chinese parallels. [113]
In the Sāmagāma-sutta, the first two ways to settle litigations are to set out what are
the proper teachings, [114] followed by bringing about a decision by the majority. [115] These
two ways of settling litigations are similarly mentioned in the two Chinese versions,
which vary, however, in the sequence of their presentation (see table 11.5).
In relation to each of these two ways of settling a litigation, the Pāli version recommends to “draw out the guidelines of the Dharma” as a reference point. [116] A similar reference is made in the two Chinese versions in relation to the case where a decision is
taken by the majority. According to the two Chinese discourses, the point of reference
in such a case should be the discourses, the Vinaya, and the summaries (mātikā). [117]
The three versions describe in similar terms how a monk can clear himself by declaring that he does not remember having committed the breach of conduct of which he is
accused. [118] He can also be cleared by others of an offence if it is found out that, although

and [[AN10.54]] at AN V 99,27 use this image to highlight the need to develop tranquillity of the mind
and higher wisdom.
112 The sequence of these seven ways in [[MN104]] is to some degree inconsistent, as its exposition works
through the following order: confrontation with the teachings, etc. (1 [st] ), decision by majority (2 [nd] ), declaration of innocence (3 [rd] ), past insanity (4 [th] ), confession (5 [th] ), prevarication by a monk of bad character
(6 [th] ), and covering over a communal litigation (7 [th] ). In the introduction to this exposition in [[MN104]] at
MN II 247,8, however, the sequence is 1, 3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, a pattern found similarly in B [e] -MN III 35,4,
C [e] -MN III 56,23, and S [e] -MIII 53,15. The sequence of listing in this introductory statement recurs at Vin
IV 207,3, [[DN33]] at DN III 254,11, and [[AN7.80]] at AN IV 144,4 (cf. also Vin II 93,32, which examines
confrontation with the teachings, etc., followed at Vin II 97,22 by taking up decision by majority). Horner 1959: 33 note 7 comments that in the main exposition in [[MN104]] “the usual order is altered”. For a
survey of these seven ways cf., e.g., Abeynayake 2009a: 84-85, Barua 1968: 76-80, Dhirasekera 1982/
2007: 232-238, Dutt 1924/1996: 129-136, Grero 1996: 117-121, Hazra 1988: 110-115, Hecker 1977:

MN II 248  In the second case, while the Pāli version describes how this monk is taken up for
cross-questioning, [121] in the Chinese versions he is just informed by other monks of
what took place while he was out of his mind. [122]
The Majjhima-nikāya and Madhyama-āgama versions describe in related ways how
someone who has confessed an offence can be cleared. [123]


the point of this rule would be that innocent monks can in this way clear themselves of wrong accusations. In the Chinese versions, however, this procedure is concerned with a monk who has committed
an offence but does not remember it, cf. [[MA196]] at T I 754b12: “if there is a person who has violated
the precepts and does not remember”, and T 85 at T I 905c16: “there is a monk
who has committed an offence but does not remember it himself”, ([[MA196]]
and T 85 take up the case of someone who does not remember due to having been out of his mind as a
separate case). On the corresponding regulation in the Mahāsā�ghika Vinaya cf. Clarke 2008: 118.
119 [[MN104]] at MN II 248,5: amū�havinayo, [[MA196]] at T I 754b23:, and T 85 at T I 905c22:

or offences bordering on pārājika. On this form of acquittal cf. also Koike 2010.

122 [[MA196]] at T I 754b27 and T 85 at T I 905c 若有一人犯戒而不憶 17. Here the Chinese versions present a more suitable manner of dealing with such a situation, since if someone has committed an offence while being out of his 有苾芻隨犯罪已不自憶念
mind, there would be little point in trying to make him later admit to it by continued cross-questioning,
a procedure appropriate in the case of a monk who tries to conceal an offence. In fact, according to Vin
II 81,12 some monks had adopted cross-questioning in the case of the monk Gagga, who had misbe- 不癡止諍律
不癡毘尼 haved while being out of his mind, a way of dealing with this case that according to the Vinaya report
met with the Buddha’s explicit disapproval. In the Karmavācanā fragment 260V4 in Härtel 1956: 46,
the monk’s confession explicitly notes that he should not be reproved or reminded of this offence, nāha�
kenacit tena vastunā sa�ghena sa�bahulai� dvābhyām ekena codayita[vya sm](ārayitavya�).

differs in so far as it examines clearance through confession by distinguishing between two possible
cases, where either the culprit knows he has committed an offence and confesses it, or else the culprit
was not aware of the fact that what he did constituted an offence.

The Sāmagāma-sutta takes up the possibility that a monk may try to conceal what he
did. After continued cross-questioning, the monks finally get the wrongdoer to admit
his deed. [124] The Sāmagāma-sutta indicates that such a type of litigation will be settled
when the monks come to the conclusion that this monk is of evil character. [125]
The Majjhima-nikāya and Madhyama-āgama versions agree that, in order to settle a
quarrel between two factions of monks, the various offences committed among them
should be considered as settled through an act of public announcement and a summary
confession. [126] According to the Madhyama-āgama discourse, during such a public announcement the monk who is to address the other monks should remind them of the fact
that they had gone forth from the household life into homelessness out of faith and in
order to undertake the path, yet, instead of pursuing the path they are now engaging in
quarrel and dispute. [127]
The parallels next take up six qualities conducive to concord and harmony, which are:

 - acting with loving kindness,

 - speaking with loving kindness,

 - thinking with loving kindness,

 - willingness to share one’s material gains,

 - maintaining virtuous conduct,

 - possessing the type of view that leads to the eradication of dukkha.
The Madhyama-āgama version adds that the ultimate purpose of these six qualities is
to lead to Nirvā�a. [128]
The final part of the three versions highlight the benefits of these six qualities in complementary ways. The Majjhima-nikāya discourse concludes by proclaiming that a monk
possessed of these six qualities will be able to bear any type of speech. [129]


124 [[MN104]] at MN II 249,25. [[MA196]] at T I 754c24 only describes his prevarications, without reporting that
he finally admits his fault. [[MN104]] stands alone in designating the deed to be a pārājika offence or an
offence bordering on pārājika. T 85 does not consider the possibility that a monk may try to conceal
what he did.
125 A more detailed description of the procedure to be adopted in such a case can be found at Vin II 85,25.
According to [[AN8.90]] at AN IV 347,6, a monk whose evil character has been determined in this way
will be divested of all possible privileges, such as having a novice as his attendant, giving teachings to
the nuns, being given a place of honour, or benefiting from a community decision. This shows that
speaking falsehood when interrogated in the midst of the monastic order was seen as a grave wrongdoing, an act whereby a monk had thoroughly dishonoured himself. On the role of speaking falsehood in
relation to the Buddhist training schemes for monastics and laity cf. also Caillat 1984a. Von Hinüber
1995a: 11 highlights “one of the basic principles of early Buddhist law as laid down in the Pātimokkha:
that the monk involved has to admit his intention to commit an offense ... speaking the truth is taken
more or less for granted here as in Brahmanical tradition, where it is thought that brahmins speak the
truth by their very nature”.

The concluding section of the Madhyama-āgama discourse proclaims that, if the
monks practise these six qualities after the Buddha’s demise, they will live together in
harmony and without dispute, being of one mind and blending like water and milk, [130]
just as if he were still among them.
The individual translation concludes by explaining that those, who practise these six
qualities conducive to communal harmony, will be at ease and free from quarrels even
after the Buddha has passed away, just as they are at ease now while he is still living
among them.


[[MN105]] Sunakkhatta-sutta

The Sunakkhatta-sutta, the “discourse to Sunakkhatta”, takes up the problem of overestimating one’s attainment. This discourse does not have a parallel in the Chinese Āgamas. Parts of this discourse have, however, been preserved in Sanskrit fragments. [131] Although the fragments do not suffice for a full comparative study of the Sunakkhattasutta, a few points can nevertheless be made.

MN II 252  The Sunakkhatta-sutta and its Sanskrit fragment counterparts describe in similar ways
how Sunakkhatta approached the Buddha to find out if the claims made by other
monks to have reached full awakening had been true.
A minor difference between the two versions is that the Sanskrit fragments qualify
Sunakkhatta as the “attendant” of the Buddha. [132] The Sunakkhatta-sutta does not explicitly attribute this role to him. The Pāli commentaries, however, record that Sunakkhatta had indeed been one of the Buddha’s attendants before Ānanda took on this


130 [[MA196]] at T I 755c13: . The same image recurs in a description of communal
harmony in [[MN31]] at MN I 206,18+29 and its parallel [[MA185]] at T I 730a28, according to which Anuruddha and his companions lived together “blending like milk and water”, khīrodakībhūta,,
and were “of one mind”, ekañ ca pana maññe cittan ti, .
131 The fragments are SHT I 32 (pp. 24-25), SHT IV 32 folios 25-33 (pp. 124-128, which includes also the
parts already published in SHT I 32), SHT IV 165 folios 6-14 (pp. 182-189, cf. also SHT VII p. 240),
SHT IV 500 folios 3-4 (pp. 220-221, cf. also SHT VII p. 255), SHT IX 2578 (p. 239), SHT X 3274 (p.
23), and the so far unpublished fragment no. 2378/7 of the Schøyen collection, identified by Klaus Wille
(I am indebted to Jens-Uwe Hartmann for kindly providing me with a preliminary draft transliteration
of these fragments). SHT I 32 = SHT IV 32 folio 25, SHT IV 165 folio 6, and SHT IX 2578 correspond
to the beginning of the discourse at MN II 252. Schøyen fragment 2378/7 sets in with the simile found 同一一心 ... 合一水乳
at MN II 253,24. SHT IV 32 folios 26-27 and SHT IV 165 folios 7-8, 10, 12a, and 13-14 parallel the
description of how, due to a particular interest, someone will listen to talk concerned with the same 合一水乳 topic,
found at MN II 253-258. SHT IV 32 folio 28, SHT IV 165 folio 12a, SHT IV 500 folio 3, and SHT X 一心

folio 4 parallel the concluding part found at MN II 260-261. In addition to these, according to Hartmann 1997: 169 the so far unedited fragments vert 26 + 27 of the Pelliot collection parallel [[MN105]] cf.
also Hartmann 2004b: 126 for yet another unpublished Sanskrit fragment parallel to [[MN105]] SHT I

role. [133] Notably, although the Pāli commentary to the Sa�yutta-nikāya specifies that
the information on the role of Sunakkhatta as one of the Buddha’s attendants has been
handed down in the canonical texts, [134] a survey of the Pāli discourses in which Sunakkhatta takes part brings to light that none of them explicitly introduces him as the Buddha’s attendant. [135]
Another difference between the Sunakkhatta-sutta and the Sanskrit fragments occurs
in regard to the interpretation of the simile of the poisoned arrow, found towards the
end of the discourse. [136] While in the Pāli version the “wound” caused by the arrow represents the six internal sense-bases, [137] in the Sanskrit version the wound appears to stand
for the physical body. [138]


133 Sv II 418,32, Spk I 258,24, Mp I 292,27, Ud-[[AN217.15]] and Th-a III 111,24; a role also accorded to him
in T 1463 at T XXIV 827c14, noted by Lamotte 1966: 145, cf. also Eimer 1987: 104 and 110.
134 Spk I 258,24: nāgasamālo upavāno sunakkhatto ... ime pana pā�iya� āgat’ upa��hākā. Von Hinüber
1977: 243 explains that the expression pā�iya� āgata refers to a text “handed down in the canon”.
135 [[DN24]] at DN III 6,7 indicates that on one occasion the Buddha went on alms round followed by Sunakkhatta as the junior monk, pacchā sama�ena. This expression only indicates that the junior monk follows the senior monk and does not necessarily entail that the junior monk acts as the elder monk’s attendant, upa��hāka. The Chinese parallel to [[DN24]] [[DA15]] at T I 67a18, also reports that Sunakkhatta
followed the Buddha on his alms round, . His personal relationship with the Buddha by serving as the Buddha’s attendant stands in contrast to his later behaviour, since Sunakkhatta
left the order and even publicly proclaimed that the Buddha had not reached any higher realization, cf.
[[MN12]] at MN I 68,8. According to [[DN24]] at DN III 3,10, he had decided to disrobe because the Buddha had not shown him any supernormal feat. Regarding his own development, according to [[DN6]] at
DN I 152,21 Sunakkhatta had attained the divine eye after being ordained for three years, suggesting
that, once gone forth, he must have been practicing earnestly for some time.
136 In this simile, according to the PTS and Siamese editions the doctor thinks that he has completely removed the poison even though in reality some of the poison is still left in the wound, [[MN105]] at MN II
257,1: sa-upādisesa� anupādiseso ti maññamāno and S [e] -MN III 67,14: sa-upādisesa� anupādiseso ti
jānamāno. According to the Burmese and Ceylonese editions, however, the doctor knows that some 時善宿比丘隨我後行
poison is still left in the wound, B [e] -MN III 44,11: sa-upādisesa� sa-upādiseso ti jānamāno and C [e] -MN
III 72,35: sa-upādisesa� sa-upādiseso ti maññamāno, a reading also favoured by Neumann 1896/1995:
1124 note 339, while Bodhi in Ñā�amoli 1995/2005: 1314 note 1003 prefers anupādiseso. The Sanskrit
fragments support E [e] and S [e], as SHT IV 500 folio 3V3 reads [sā]va[ś]e�a� nira[va](śe)�a� (iti manyamāna�); cf. also SHT X 3274V3. Again, while according to E [e] the doctor tells the patient that the
wound can still cause him harm, [[MN105]] at MN II 257,4: alañ ca te antarāyāya, according to the other
editions the doctor tells the patient that the wound will not be able to cause him harm, B [e] -MN III 44,14
and C [e] -MN III 74,2: analañ ca te antarāyāya and S [e] -MN III 67,16: alañ ca te anantarāyāya. In E [e] the
patient then reflects that the wound will not harm him, [[MN105]] at MN II 257,13: analañ ca me antarāyāya, while in the other editions his reflection is the same as the indication made by the doctor. According to SHT IV 500 folio 3V4, however, the doctor told the patient that the wound can still cause harm,
ala[�]te-t(r)-ānta[r](ā)yāya; cf. also SHT X 3274 V4. According to SHT IV 500 folio 3R3, the patient
in his reflections knew that it was still capable of causing him harm, niravaśe�a� a[pa](nī)[t](o) vi�ado�a� ala� [me-tr]-ān(ta)rā[y](āya); cf. also SHT X 3274R3. For occurrences of the arrow image in

612   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


The Pāli version concludes the simile of the poisoned arrow by highlighting that a
liberated monk will not get involved with objects of attachment. The corresponding
passage in the Sanskrit fragment mentions sensually enticing objects, which could be
understood to draw out in more detail the implication of the “objects of attachment”
that should better be avoided. [139]
Another difference is that, while the Pāli version takes the name of the monk Sunakkhatta as its title, judging from the Sanskrit fragments the title of the Sanskrit discourse
is “discourse [on the] arrow”, Śalya-sūtra. [140] This title thus draws attention to the simile of the poisoned arrow, which in a way does indeed sum up the gist of the whole discourse.

MN II 261  The Pāli version employs the image of a poisonous snake in order to illustrate an
arahant’s aloofness from objects of attachment, after which it ends. The Sanskrit version appears to have had a different conclusion. Although the remains of this conclusion are too fragmentary to allow a reconstruction, they could be recording an instruction by the Buddha to meditate. [141] Such an instruction would be a fitting conclusion to

dard description of the nature of the human body in the Pāli discourses as “made up of rice and porridge”, odanakummāsūpacaya. In several Pāli discourses this qualification occurs in the context of a
simile, such as in [[MN23]] at MN I 144,2, where the body “made up of rice and porridge” corresponds to
the image of a termite mound; in [[SN35.103]] at SN IV 83,25 and in [[AN9.15]] at AN IV 386,20, which
identify the body “made up of rice and porridge” with a boil; in [[SN35.204]] at SN IV 194,26, where the
body “made up of rice and porridge” corresponds to a city; and in [[SN41.5]] at SN IV 292,7, where the
body “made up of rice and porridge” is represented by a chariot. Although in the present instance the
Sanskrit fragment does not indicate with which aspect of the simile the body should be identified, the
context suggests the image of the wound, as the other parts of the simile would not fit such an identification. SHT IV p. 220 note 12 notes another minor difference, as in the Pāli version the physician instructs his patient to take only suitable food and avoid unsuitable food, to wash the wound, and to avoid
that the wound gets covered by pus, etc., thereby taking up the positive and the negative aspect of each
task together. In the Sanskrit version, the physician first lists all the positive actions to be undertaken
and then only describes all the negative effects that should be avoided.
139 SHT IV 165 folio 14Bc: (pri)[ya]rūpā� kāmopasa�[h](itā), Bd: (ma)[n]āpā� priyarūpā� kāmo[pa],
and Be: (sukha)llikānuyoga anuyuktā�. The commentary, Ps IV 56,5, explains that the reference in [[MN105]] to upadhi stands for kāmupadhi, “attachment to sensuality”. From this viewpoint, the Sanskrit version’s reference to sensual pleasures could be seen as indeed drawing out the implications of the Pāli
version’s reference to attachment.
140 Cf. the discussion in SHT IV p. 7 of the uddāna published in Schlingloff 1961: 33.
141 References to places suitable for meditation can be found in SHT IV 32 folio 33R3: [mū]la�, paralleling the “root of a tree”, rukkhamūla, and in SHT IV 500 folio 4V4: (girigu)[h]ā-palālapu, paralleling
the “mountain cave”, giriguha, and the “heap of straw”, palālapuñja, mention ed in the standard description of places suitable for meditation in the Pāli discourses, e.g., in [[MN27]] at MN I 181,12 (the
root of a tree and the mountain cave, together with an empty place, are also included in Jain descriptions of appropriate places for monks, cf., e.g., the Āyāra�ga 1.8.2.1 (or 1.7.2.1) in Jacobi 1882: 33,8 or
Schubring 1910/1966: 34,7: sunnāgāra�si vā giriguha�si vā rukkhamūla�si vā, cf. also Bollée 2004:
257 add. to note 117). SHT IV 32 folio 33R5 and SHT IV 500 folio 4V5 can be combined to yield the
concluding sentence (a)smāka(m anuśā)[sa]na, similar to the concluding sentence found at the end of
an emphatic exhortation to practise meditation: “this is my teaching to you”, aya� vo amhāka� anusāsanī ti, e.g., in [[MN19]] at MN I 118,24. Although in the Pāli discourses the listing of places suitable

an exposition on the dangers of overestimating one’s level of attainment, thereby encouraging the monks to undertake the practice required in order to attain what some of
them mistakenly thought to have already accomplished.


[[MN106]] Āneñjasappāya-sutta

The Āneñjasappāya-sutta, the “discourse on [what] is suitable for [the attainment of]
imperturbability”, describes approaches to the attainment of high levels of concentration and of Nirvā�a. This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama and in a
discourse quotation in Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya. [142]
The basic pattern of the discourse proceeds through the following themes:

 - three ways to imperturbability,

 - three ways to nothingness,

 - one way to neither-perception-nor-non-perception,

 - the attainment of Nirvā�a.
The Āneñjasappāya-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel describe in similar
terms how imperturbability can be developed based on insight into the true nature of
sensual pleasures (the beginning part of the discourse is not covered in the discourse
quotation in Śamathadeva’s commentary). A difference in formulation is that the Majjhima-nikāya version examines the true nature of sensual pleasures and of perceptions
of sensuality, while the Madhyama-āgama version mentions sensual pleasures and material forms, without bringing in perceptions. [143] In regard to each of the paths to imperturbability examined in the discourse, the Āneñjasappāya-sutta and its parallels indi

for meditation occurs usually in the context of an exposition of the gradual path, perhaps the Sanskrit
version of the present discourse made use of a similar listing in the context of an injunction to meditate
in such places, an injunction which might then have found its conclusion in the Buddha’s proclamation
that this was his way of teaching.
142 The parallels are [[MA75]] at T I 542b-543b, which agrees with [[MN106]] on locating the discourse in Kammāsadhamma in the Kuru country and has the title “discourse on the path [to] pure imperturbability”,
, and Abhidh-k-� at D (4094) mngon pa, ju 227b7-230b2 or Q (5595) tu 260a4-263a6, which
sets in with the second way to imperturbability; cf. also Abhidh-k 4:46 in Pradhan 1967: 227,16, with
its Chinese parallels in T 1558 at T XXIX 81a10 and T 1559 at T XXIX 237a28. [[MA75]] has been translated in Anālayo 2009a; cf. also Minh Chau 1964/1991: 149.
143 The presentation in [[MN106]] at MN II 261,25 lists “present sensual pleasures”, di��hadhammikā kāmā,
“future sensual pleasures”, samparāyikā kāmā, “present sensual perceptions”, di��hadhammikā kāmasaññā, and “future sensual perceptions”, samparāyikā kāmasaññā. [[MA75]] at T I 542b13 instead speaks
of “present sensual pleasures as well as future sensual pleasures ... present forms as well as future
forms”, . A similarly worded passage in the Śrāvakabhūmi
speaks only of sensual pleasures (celestial and human), cf. Deleanu 2006a: 321,2 or Shukla 1973:
淨不動道經 441,16 and T 1579 at T XXX 466a13. Another difference is that [[MN106]] at MN II 262,13 describes
how, through the removal of covetousness and aversion, the mind will become boundless and immeasurable, aparittañ ca me citta� bhavissati appamā�a�. Although [[MA75]] does not explicitly make this
point, the same would be implicit in the circumstance that both versions refer to the mind that has become “great”, mahaggata/ .

cate that, after having attained imperturbability, rebirth in the corresponding realm becomes possible. [144]
The three versions also take up the possibility of developing wisdom based on the
attainment of imperturbability. [145] The theme of wisdom is in fact central throughout
each version of the discourse, as most of the ways of developing the mind described in
the Āneñjasappāya-sutta and its parallels involve approaches to the development of insight.

MN II 262  The Āneñjasappāya-sutta and its parallels describe an alternative way to reach the
imperturbable based on insight into the nature of material form. The Pāli version states
that all material form consists of the four elements. The Chinese presentation additionally explains that the four elements should be contemplated as impermanent, unsatisfactory, and subject to cessation, while the Tibetan version considers them as
impermanent and conditioned. [146]
Another difference in regard to this second of altogether three ways to imperturbability is that the Pāli version begins its treatment by taking up the same sensual pleasures
and perceptions of sensuality it had already mentioned in relation to the first way to
imperturbability. [147] The description of the second way to imperturbability in the Chinese and Tibetan versions does not mention sensual pleasures or perceptions of sensuality, but only speaks of material form.

MN II 263  The third way to imperturbability involves insight into perceptions. In their examination of the third way to imperturbability, the three versions draw attention to the impermanent nature of perceptions. While the Pāli version enjoins detachment from what
is impermanent, [148] the Chinese version highlights that perceptions are impermanent,
unsatisfactory, and subject to cessation, and the Tibetan version notes that perceptions
are impermanent and conditioned. [149]


144 [[MN106]] at MN II 262,17 speaks in this context of the “evolving consciousness”, sa�vattanikam viññā�a�, that reaches imperturbability, which Ps IV 61,20 identifies as the karmically resultant consciousness, vipākaviññā�a, on the term cf. also Collins 1982: 215. [[MA75]] at T I 542b23 does not use such an
expression, instead explaining that “because of that former state of mind, he will certainly reach imperturbability”, . The discourse quotation in Śamathadeva’s commentary agrees in
this respect with [[MN106]] cf. D (4094) mngon pa, ju 228a2 or Q (5595) tu 260a7 which, in relation to
the second path to imperturbability (the quoted section does not cover the first way to imperturbability)
speaks of the bsgrubs pas rnam par shes pa that reaches imperturbability.

The Chinese version concludes that in this way perception of imperturbability will be
reached. [150] The Pāli and Tibetan versions do not refer to perception of imperturbability
at this point. All three versions, however, mention the need to transcend perceptions of
imperturbability when describing the next stage of practice. [151]
The Āneñjasappāya-sutta and its parallels continue by taking up three ways of attaining the sphere of nothingness. In the Pāli version, the first way to the attainment of
nothingness takes place by contemplating the cessation of perceptions – related to sensuality, material form, and imperturbability - as peaceful and sublime. [152] In the Chinese version, the first way to attaining the sphere of nothingness takes place by directing
awareness to these perceptions as being impermanent, unsatisfactory, and subject to
cessation. The Tibetan version again mentions impermanence and conditionality. In this
way, the Chinese and Tibetan accounts continue with the same insight development already practised earlier, which then leads to a higher stage by broadening the scope of
its application, as in the present case it covers also perception of imperturbability.
The second approach to nothingness, described in the Pāli and Chinese versions, is
based on contemplating emptiness in terms of the absence of a self, a contemplation
that in the Tibetan version constitutes the third approach to nothingness. [153] In the Chi

This fits well with the presentation in [[MA75]] according to which the attainment of the perception of
imperturbability is part of the third way to imperturbability and then needs to be overcome in order to
progress to the next stage of meditation.

santa� eta� pa�īta�, yadida� ākiñcaññāyatana�. The qualification “peaceful and sublime”, which
[[MN106]] at MN II 264,11 also applies to the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, recurs in
other discourses in relation to Nirvā�a, cf. [[MN64]] at MN I 436,1, [[AN5.31]] at AN I 133,1, [[AN9.36]] at
AN IV 423,3, [[AN10.6]] at AN V 8,6, [[AN10.60]] at AN V 110,22, [[AN11.7]] at AN V 319,14, [[AN11.9]] at

[[MN152]] at MN III 299,12 uses these two qualifications to recommend equanimity in relation to pleasant and unpleasant experiences. The same two qualifications occur also in descriptions of the views of outsiders. [[MN102]] at MN II 230,18, MN II 231,17, MN II 235,11+33, and at MN II
236,21 depicts recluses and Brahmins who qualify the attainment of unconsciousness, asaññā, the attainment of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, and the happiness and equanimity of the jhānas as
“peaceful” and “sublime”. It 2:12 at It 44,1 records the annihilationist view that “when this self ... is
annihilated and destroyed ... this is peaceful, this is sublime”, yata kira ... aya� attā ... ucchijjati vinassati ... eta� santa� eta� pa�īta� (C [e] -It 376,3: yato). This usage suggests these two qualifications to
stand for an experience or attainment that forms the goal of practice. The same does not apply to the
present instance, however, since from a Buddhist perspective the spheres of nothingness and of neitherperception-nor-non-perception are not the final goal of practice.

nese and Tibetan versions, such contemplation of emptiness also covers the absence of
permanence. [154]

MN II 264  The third way to nothingness in the Pāli version is to contemplate that one does not
belong to anyone else nor does anything belong to oneself. The parallel versions could
reflect a similar mode of practice, expressed somewhat differently. [155] A discourse in
the A�guttara-nikāya presents this form of contemplation as a practice undertaken by
the Jains, [156] while another A�guttara-nikāya discourse, together with its Chinese parallels and a Sanskrit fragment, attribute this type of contemplation to Brahmins. [157]
The Āneñjasappāya-sutta and its parallels next turn to the attainment of neither-perception-nor-non-perception in similar ways. [158] Once the examination of the attainment


contemplate suññam ida� attena vā attaniyena vā leads to “liberation of the mind by emptiness”, suññatā cetovimutti. [[SN35.85]] at SN IV 54,4 employs the same statement to explain why the world of experience is reckoned as “empty”. The parallel [[SA232]] at T II 56b25 additionally mentions
, which Lamotte 1973/1993: 18 translates as being “empty of perpetuity and changelessness”;
cf. also Choong 2000: 93.
154 [[MA75]] at T I 542c18: “this world is empty, empty of a self, empty of what belongs to a self, empty of
being permanent, empty of being everlasting, empty of existing continuously, and empty of being unchanging”,, (following the gloss in the

’gyur ba’i chos can gyis stong zhing bdag dang bdag gi dang bral ba’o (with the difference that here 常, 恒, 不變
this 易法空 forms the third approach to nothingness). Baba 2004: 944 explains that this type of treatment (found
also in [[SA232]] at T II 56b25, quoted above in note 153) makes use of “expressions of emptiness that
are more recent than those in the first four Pāli Nikāyas”, as a similar treatment can be found in historically later Pāli works such as the Pa�isambhidāmagga, cf. Pa�is I 109,10: suñña� attena vā attaniyena

of neither-perception-nor-non-perception had been completed, according to all versions
Ānanda described a contemplation that revolves around the cessation of what is and
what will be, querying whether a monk would attain Nirvā�a through such contemplation. The three versions report the Buddha explaining that this depends on whether the
monk has attachment to the equanimity achieved through this contemplation, as Nirvā�a will be attained only if such attachment is avoided.
According to the Āneñjasappāya-sutta and its parallels, to be attached to the equanimity reached through this contemplation is to be attached to neither-perception-nornon-perception, which is supreme among objects of attachment. According to the Pāli
version, Ānanda concluded that the Buddha had taught how to cross the flood in dependence on one support after the other, a statement not found in the other versions. [159]
The Āneñjasappāya-sutta and its parallels report that Ānanda also inquired about noble liberation. In all versions, such liberation transcends all the types of perception mentioned so far, which are mere constituents of personality. The Chinese and Tibetan versions draw out the implications of this statement by bringing in the theme of birth, old
age, disease, and death. [160]
The three versions conclude with the Buddha’s emphatic recommendation to retire to
secluded spots and meditate, lest one later regret it. [161]

In the present context, however, rather seems to stand for the fourth immaterial attainment,

found in the Ekottarika-āgama at all. Lü 1963: 242 remarks, in regard to Gautama Sa�ghadeva’s translation of the Madhyama-āgama, that “some of the newly coined terms of this re-translation were after- 非有想非無想
wards again replaced by those used in the old version” (cf. also above p. 374 note 178 and below p. 785

of chariots that follow each other “one after the other”. Chalmers 1927: 154 renders nissāya nissāya as

[[MN107]] Ga�akamoggallāna-sutta

The Ga�akamoggallāna-sutta, the “discourse to the accountant Moggallāna”, takes
as its main theme the gradual path. This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama and another parallel in an individual translation. [162]

MN III 1  According to the Ga�akamoggallāna-sutta and its parallels, the accountant Moggallāna wanted to know if the training in the Dharma could be compared to the gradual
training seen in other crafts. The three versions agree that he illustrated his inquiry with
the example of the gradual nature of the steps of the staircase leading up to the Hall of
Migāra’s Mother, [163] as well as with the examples of the gradual training required for the
study of the Brahminical scriptures, for archery, and for accounting. According to the
two Chinese versions, he also mentioned the gradual training given to elephants and
horses. [164] In the Pāli version, however, it is the Buddha who comes out with the image
of training a horse, which he employs as an introduction to his exposition of the gradual training of his disciples. [165]

MN III 2  The Ga�akamoggallāna-sutta begins its account of the gradual path with observance
of the monastic rules. [166] The two parallels speak instead of developing bodily, verbal,
and mental purity (see table 11.6). [167]


at MN II 266,5 only records Ānanda rejoicing. As mentioned above p. 66, it is a stylistic device in the
early discourses that by mentioning the most important member of a group, anyone else present is implicitly included. The presence of other monks can in fact be seen in the recurrent address bhikkhave
used by the Buddha throughout the discourse, and also in [[MN106]] at MN II 266,1, where the Buddha
addresses Ānanda with the plural personal pronoun vo, making it clear that his final injunction was addressed to Ānanda and to whatever other monks were present during the delivery of the discourse.
162 The parallels are [[MA144]] at T I 652a-653c and T 70 at T I 875a-876b, both of which agree with [[MN107]] on locating the discourse in the Hall of Migāra’s Mother by Sāvatthī. [[MA144]] also agrees with [[MN107]] on the title “discourse to the accountant Moggallāna”,, while the title of T 70 is
simply “discourse spoken by the Buddha to an accountant”, . Skilling 2000b: 341 notes that
the Vyākhyāyukti-�īkā, D (4069) sems tsam, si 284a4 or Q (5570) i 171a8, similarly refers to the present
discourse by the title “the accountant”, rtsis mkhan. According to the information given in the Taishō
edition, T 70 was translated by Făjù ( ). For a remark on [[MA144]] cf. Minh Chau 1964/1991: 32.
163 The reference in [[MN107]] at MN III 1,10 to a pacchima sopānaka�evara (Ce-MN III 90,9: sopānaka�ebara) recurs in [[MN85]] at MN II 92,22, where it also refers to the “last step of a staircase” that leads up
to a building, in this case the staircase to Prince Bodhi’s Kokanada Palace. [[MA144]] at T I 652a15 and T
70 at T I 875a20 additionally specify that the staircase to the Hall of Migāra’s Mother had four steps.

166 [[MN107]] at MN III 2,7. Although a reference to the monastic rules is absent from the parallels to MN 佛說數經
107, a similar description can be found in [[MA145]] at T I 654c16, paralleling an occurrence of such a
description in [[MN108]] at MN III 11,17.
167 [[MA144]] at T I 652b1 and T 70 at T I 875b 法炬 6. While the basic import of this passage in the parallel versions is the same, in as much as they present virtuous conduct as the basis for the gradual path, their
formulations set a different emphasis. [[MN107]] highlights in particular the importance of closely adhering to the rules, whereas [[MA144]] and T 70 give more emphasis to the purpose of the rules in form of
bodily, verbal, and mental purification. This to some extent parallels a difference in emphasis noted
above p. 47.


Chapter 11 Devadaha-vagga                                    -  619


The Ga�akamoggallāna-sutta next takes up restraint at the sense-doors, a practice
described in similar terms in its parallels. A minor but noteworthy difference is that the
Chinese versions explicitly refer to the role of mindfulness in relation to sense-restraint. [168]

Other discourses illustrate the role of mindfulness in relation to sense-restraint with
various similes, indicating among others that mindfulness keeps the streams (of desire)
in check, [169] so that its function can be compared to the gatekeeper of a town, [170] or to a
strong post to which wild animals (representing the senses) are bound. [171] The relevance


168 [[MA144]] at T I 652b11 instructs to “guard and protect the mind with mindfulness and become accomplished [in such protection]”, . T 70 at T I 875b12 similarly recommends that one
should “protect one’s own mind [by] protecting the mind [through] mindfulness”, . Yit
2004a: 185 relates this additional specification to [[AN5.114]] at AN III 138,20, which associates senserestraint with “protective mindfulness”, ārakkhasatino, and also speaks of being “endowed with a mind
protected by mindfulness”, satārakkhena cetasā samannāgata. The idea of protection through mindfulness is also found in relation to sense-restraint in the Mahāvastu in Basak 1968/2004: 31,30 or in Senart
1897: 52,4: ārak�āsm�ti ... araktena cetasā samanvāgata�. Similar nuances occur in the Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1978a: 240,20, which speaks of guptasm�timānasa�; cf. also the Śrāvakabhūmi, Shukla
1973: 64,6, 65,9, and 66,4 or ŚSG 1998: 100,8+18 and 101,2, with the Chinese version in T 1579 at T
XXX 406b24 and T XXX 406c3+10, which under the heading of indriyasa�vara gives a detailed exposition of the implications of 守護念心而得成就 ārak�itasm�ti/, nipakasm�ti/, and sm�tyārak�itamānasa/ . On mindfulness as a form of protection cf. also Anālayo 2011e. 自護其意護意念

of mindfulness to sense-restraint is thus a recurrent theme in other discourses, yet the
same is not explicitly taken into account in the standard description of sense-restraint
in the Pāli discourses.

The emphasis on mindfulness in the two Chinese versions continues to be prominent,
as even before turning to sense-restraint they take up the four satipa��hānas, [172] a practice not mentioned explicitly in the gradual path scheme in the Ga�akamoggallāna-sutta or in the standard exposition of the gradual path in other Pāli discourses. [173]
The Madhyama-āgama discourse indicates that satipa��hāna should be developed in
such a way that it leads to leaving behind sensual and unwholesome thoughts. [174] This
then leads over to the practice of mindfulness in regard to restraint at the sense-doors,
where the task is to avoid the arising of states of covetousness or dejection. [175]


172 [[MA144]] at T I 652b4 and T 70 at T I 875b9.
173 The four satipa��hānas are also not explicitly mentioned in the account of the gradual path given in [[MA146]] (parallel to [[MN27]]) and in [[MA187]] (parallel to [[MN112]]). An account of the gradual path of training in [[MN125]] at MN III 136,4 and in its parallel [[MA198]] at T I 758b3, however, does take up the four
satipa��hānas, cf. also below p. 718. The four satipa��hānas also occur in two consecutive versions of
the gradual path in the Sa�yukta-āgama, where in one case, [[SA636]] at T II 176b15, they occur after the
removal of the hindrances (i.e., in the position where normally the four absorptions are found), while in
the other, [[SA637]] at T II 176b26, they instead come right after contentment. The four satipa��hānas occur also in an account of the gradual path in [[DA20]] at T I 85a6, in which case they are not found in the
corresponding Pāli discourse, [[DN3]] at DN I 100,9. The absence of any explicit reference to satipa��hāna
in the standard accounts of the gradual path of training in the Pāli discourses is noteworthy. According
to the Satipa��hāna-sutta and its parallels, the practice of satipa��hāna constitutes the path to the realization of Nirvā�a, cf. above p. 75. Thus, to undertake satipa��hāna would be a necessary step for reaching the goal of the gradual path, in fact, according to [[AN10.95]] at AN V 195,11, all those who realize
awakening (here expressed in terms of “escaping from the world”) do so by way of overcoming the
hindrances, being well established in satipa��hāna, and having developed the awakening factors. In
view of this, satipa��hāna would merit explicit treatment in an account of the gradual path to awakening. In a way, satipa��hāna may be implicitly included in those parts of the gradual path that mention
the practice of mindfulness and clear comprehension in regard to a set of physical activities. This exercise is also part of the scheme of contemplating the body in the Satipa��hāna-suttas, cf. [[MN10]] at MN I
57,5 (or [[DN22]] at DN II 292,24) and [[MA98]] at T I 582b25. In the context of the gradual path, such
mindfulness and clear comprehension in regard to physical activities then leads up to more formal
meditation in a secluded place, where the abandoning of the hindrances paves the way for the development of the four jhānas. Yet, the same practice of mindfulness and clear comprehension is already
taken into account in [[MN107]] and its parallels [[MA144]] and T 70, which similarly present mindfulness
and clear comprehension in regard to physical activities as the basis for approaching a secluded place,
removing the hindrances, and developing the four jhānas. As [[MA144]] and T 70 nevertheless refer to
the four satipa��hānas separately, it becomes evident that, from their perspective, the four satipa��hānas
are not implicitly covered by mindfulness and clear comprehension in regard to physical activities.
174 [[MA144]] at T I 652b7 instructs: “do not think a thought related to sensuality”,, and “do
not think a thought related to what is unrightful”, . A similar instruction can be found
in [[MN125]] at MN III 136,22 and its parallel [[MA198]] at T I 758b15, cf. below p. 719 notes 167 and 168.
175 [[MN107]] at MN III 2,16: abhijjhādomanassā ... dhammā, [[MA144]] at T I 652b14:, and
T 70 at T I 875b14: . The removal of covetousness and dejection is in fact a central task
of mindfulness, mentioned as such also in the introductory sections of the Satipa��hāna-sutta, [[MN10]] at
莫念欲相應念
莫念非法相應念
貪伺, 憂慼 ... 法
貪憂慼意 ... 法


Chapter 11 Devadaha-vagga                                    -  621


Thus from the perspective of the Madhyama-āgama parallel to the Ga�akamoggallāna-sutta, it seems that mindfulness by way of the four satipa��hānas builds up a mental condition aloof from sensual and unwholesome thoughts. This mental condition will
then be further developed by maintaining mindfulness at the sense-doors in order to
avoid a re-arising of sensual and unwholesome thoughts.
Based on such mindful sense-restraint, the practice of mindfulness can then be combined with clear comprehension in relation to any type of bodily activity. The continuity of mindfulness that has been developed in this way would in turn form the basis for
overcoming the hindrances and developing the jhānas, where mindfulness again plays
a central role. [176]
While the two Chinese versions give additional emphasis to the practice of mindfulness, they do not take into account moderation with food and the practice of wakefulness, two steps of the gradual path covered in the Pāli version (see above table 11.6). [177]
The Ga�akamoggallāna-sutta and its parallels depict the remainder of the gradual
path in similar terms, from mindfulness and clear comprehension via the abandoning of
the hindrances to the four jhānas. [178]


MN I 56,5 (or [[DN22]] at DN II 290,13): vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassa�. Ps I 243,35 explains vineyya
to be a gerund, vinayitvā. Although gerund forms usually indicate that an action is completed, in Sanskrit usage the gerund can also express simultaneousness, cf., e.g., Geiger 1923: 86 and Macdonnel
1927/1990: 202. In the present context, vineyya may similarly refer to an action that takes place concurrently with the main action of the sentence, i. e., concurrently with anupassī viharati, so that vineyya
loke abhijjhādomanassa� can be understood to refer to “removing covetousness and dejection”, thereby highlighting what takes place while undertaking satipa��hāna. That to overcome unwholesome
states is a task of satipa��hāna, instead of being a precondition for its practice, is in fact reflected in
other discourses, as according to [[AN9.64]] at AN IV 458,4 satipa��hāna is the tool to overcome the five
hindrances, while according to [[AN9.65]] at AN IV 458,21 through satipa��hāna one overcomes the
attraction of sensual pleasures.
176 That satipa��hāna may be relevant already to initial stages of the practice of the gradual path can also
be seen in [[SN47.4]] at SN V 144,15 and its parallel [[SA621]] at T II 173c16, according to which the four
satipa��hānas should be taught right away to newly ordained monks.
177 [[MN107]] at MN III 2,29: bhojane mattaññū hohi and [[MN107]] at MN III 3,2: jāgariya� anuyutto viharāhi. Even within the Majjhima-nikāya collection descriptions of the gradual path can be found that do
not mention moderation with food or the practice of wakefulness, cf. [[MN27]] at MN I 181, [[MN38]] at
MN I 269, [[MN51]] at MN I 346, [[MN94]] at MN II 162, [[MN101]] at MN II 226, and [[MN112]] at MN III
35. The same two practices are also absent from accounts of the gradual path in the Dīgha-nikāya, but
are taken into account, as noted by Meisig 1984: 130, in the gradual path scheme found in the Dīrghaāgama, cf., e.g., [[DA10]] at T I 84c20.
178 A minor difference is that [[MA144]] at T I 652c5 and T 70 at T I 875b30 explicitly mention the sitting
mat used for meditation (cf. above p. 20). In relation to abandoning the hindrances, [[MA144]] and T 70
take up the implications of covetousness in additional detail, explaining it to be a state of mind that desires to possess what belongs to others, cf. [[MA144]] at T I 652c7: “seeing another’s wealth ... don’t [let]
covetousness arise, wishing: ‘may I get it’”,, and T 70 at T I 875c2:
“don’t develop covetousness for the wealth of others, thinking: ‘may the possessions of others be mine’”,
. A Pāli counterpart to this explanation can be found, e.g., in [[MN41]]
at MN I 287,8.

622   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


MN III 4  The Pāli version explains that these instructions are meant for monks who have not
yet reached the final goal, adding that monks who have reached the final goal nevertheless continue to undertake the same practices. The Chinese versions point out that these
instructions are particularly beneficial for newly ordained monks, while in the case of
senior monks the Buddha will continue to teach them the way to the total eradication of
the influxes. [179] This presentation is in accord with the way the Chinese versions approached the subject of the gradual path, as in these two accounts the gradual path is
concerned with a newly ordained monk, [180] paralleling the accountant Moggallāna’s
description of how a newcomer to accountancy will be instructed gradually.

MN III 5   The Ga�akamoggallāna-sutta and its parallels continue in similar ways by employing the example of the path to Rājagaha to illustrate why, in spite of the Buddha’s instructions, some monks do not reach the goal. According to all versions, the accountant
Moggallāna came to the conclusion that the Buddha did not associate with persons possessed of bad qualities, but only with persons who are endowed with good qualities. [181]
The Chinese versions illustrate this conclusion by describing how someone looks after
a grove of sāla trees in various ways, providing water and taking out weeds, thereby
ensuring the growth and welfare of the trees. [182]
Applied to the present context, this comparison suggests that persons possessed of
bad qualities, with whom the Buddha does not associate, are comparable to weeds taken
out by those who care for the sāla grove, while good persons, with whom the Buddha
associates, would correspond to the sāla trees.


179 [[MA144]] at T I 652c13 explains that by giving these instructions “the Tathāgata is of much benefit for
young monks”,, after which it indicates that “if there are senior monks,
elders who have trained in the holy life during the past, the Tathāgata teaches them further, namely the
ultimate and complete destruction of the influxes”,
. T 70 at T I 875c7 similarly indicates that “the Tathāgata is of much benefit to monks
who have started to train”,, and then explains that “in regard to elder monks
... who are established in diligent practice of the holy life, the Tathāgata ... [leads them] to attaining the
cessation of existence and the destruction of the influxes”,
.
180 In [[MA144]] at T I 652a29 the disciple who is taught the gradual path is a “young monk who has just come
to train in the path and started to enter this Dharma and discipline”,,,
and in T 70 at T I 875b 如來為諸年少比丘多有所益 5 a “monk who has just started to train and recently come to this Dharma and
discipline”, . [[MN107]] at MN III 2,6 is less explicit, as it indicates that when
the Tathāgata “has obtained a person to be tamed, he at first trains him thus 若有比丘長老, 上尊, 舊學梵行, ”, purisadamma� labhitvā, 如來復上教, 謂
究竟訖一切漏盡 pa�hama� eva� vineti, which, however, also gives the impression that the disciple would be a beginner.
181 Ps IV 70,15 explains that the 如來為初學比丘多有所益 accountant Moggallāna made this proclamation because he had understood
why some disciples do not reach the goal.
182 [[MA144]] at T I 653b12 and T 70 at T I 876a21. The image of looking after a grove of 彼諸比丘上尊 ... 無懈怠住行於梵行, sāla trees recurs in 如來
... [[MN21]] at MN I 124, 至竟盡有漏盡 28 and its parallel [[MA193]] at T I 744b20. The contrast highlighted in [[MN107]] at
MN III 6,10 between those who have bad qualities and those who have the corresponding good qualities recurs in the same terms in [[MN5]] at MN I 32,7. Similar to [[MA144]] and T 70, [[MN5]] introduces this 年少比丘初來學道 始入法律者
exposition with a simile, although it makes use of a different image, not employing the simile of the
grove of sāla 比丘初學不久至此法律 trees.


Chapter 11 Devadaha-vagga                                    -  623


The parallel versions record that the accountant Moggallāna compared the superiority
of the Buddha’s teaching to exquisite fragrance. [183] While the Pāli version only indicates
that the advice given by the Buddha is supreme among things of today, [184] according to
the Chinese versions his teaching is able to subdue all heterodox teachings. [185] The three
versions conclude with the accountant Moggallāna taking refuge. [186]


[[MN108]] Gopakamoggallāna-sutta

The Gopakamoggallāna-sutta, the “discourse to Gopakamoggallāna”, examines the
causes due to which harmony prevailed in the Buddhist monastic community after the
Buddha’s demise. This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama. [187] In addition
to this parallel, the final part of the Gopakamoggallāna-sutta has a counterpart in a partial discourse quotation in Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya,
extant in Tibetan. [188]
The Gopakamoggallāna-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel begin by narrating
that King Ajātasattu was getting Rājagaha fortified. The Majjhima-nikāya version explains that he was apprehensive of an attack by King Pajjota of Avanti, whereas according to the Madhyama-āgama account he was apprehensive of the Vajjians. [189] Other
discourses also report that King Ajātasattu was at odds with the Vajjians, [190] but there


183 While [[MN107]] at MN III 6,27 takes up two types of incense and one type of flower to illustrate the
Buddha’s superiority, [[MA144]] at T I 653b26 and T 70 at T I 876b7 take up two types of incense and
two types of flower, namely the supreme fragrance among flowers that grow in water and the supreme
fragrance among flowers that grow on land.
184 [[MN107]] at MN III 7,2: bhoto gotamassa ovādo paramajjadhammesu.
185 [[MA144]] at T I 653c7: and T 70 at T I 876b15: . The Pāli commentary in a similar vein explains that the reference in [[MN107]] to “things of today” should be understood
to intend the six heterodox teachers (i.e. Pūra�a Kassapa, etc.), Ps IV 70,18: ajjadhammā nāma cha satthāradhammā.
186 Before expressing his going for refuge, according to [[MN107]] at MN III 7,2 the accountant Moggallāna
praised the Buddha’s exposition by using the image of setting something upright, revealing something
hidden, showing the path, and holding up a lamp in the dark, a set of images not mentioned in [[MA144]]
or T 70.
187 The parallel is [[MA145]] at T I 653c-656a, which agrees with [[MN108]] on locating the discourse at Rājagaha and on taking the name of Ānanda’s visitor for its title, . For counterparts to [[MN108]] at MN III 13,26-32 能伏一切外道異學 in Vyākhyāyukti literature cf. Skilling 2000b: 341. For a remark on [[MA145]] cf. 能攝一切異學

appears to be no record elsewhere in the Pāli canon of a conflict between him and King
Pajjota of Avanti. [191]
The two discourses report that Ānanda visited the Brahmin Gopakamoggallāna, who
asked Ānanda if any of the monks was equal in qualities to their recently deceased
teacher. The Brahmin minister Vassakāra joined the ensuing discussion, [192] during which
Ānanda clarified that there was not a single monk equal to the Buddha, nor had the
Buddha appointed any monk as his successor, [193] nor had the monastic community chosen a successor to the Buddha.

MN III 8  According to the Pāli version, Ānanda further explained that no monk was equal to
the Buddha, because the Buddha was the one who had discovered the path. [194] The Gopakamoggallāna-sutta in this way highlights what, from the perspective of the early


skrit, and Tibetan counterparts [[DA2]] at T I 11a10, T 5 at T I 160b9, T 6 at T I 176a6, fragment [[SN360]]
folio 151V5-6 in Waldschmidt 1950: 7, and the Tibetan version in Waldschmidt 1951: 103; cf. also [[MA142]] at T I 648a26. That the Vajjians were under threat of being attacked by Ajātasattu is also reflected
in [[SN20.8]] at SN II 268,2 and its parallel [[SA1252]] at T II 344b9, in SHT V 1290 V6 (p. 205), and in the
Sa�ghabhedavastu, Gnoli 1978a: 218,17 (the last two also in Sander 1985: 152). On the reasons for
Ajātasattu’s wish to conquer the Vajjians cf. also Choudhary 1963.
191 Ps IV 71,1 explains that, after his patricide, Ajātasattu was afraid that King Pajjota might want to punish
him, as King Bimbisāra had been a friend of King Pajjota; cf. also Rhys Davids 1903/1997: 13. Elsewhere in the discourses there seems to be no mention made of a close friendship between these two
kings, in fact according to Vin I 278,21 on one occasion Bimbisāra approved of a ruse played on Pajjota, to whom he referred to as a “violent” person, ca��o. This passage does not give the impression
that, from the perspective of the Pāli tradition, the two had been such close friends that Pajjota would
want to attack Ajātasattu in order to revenge the killing of Bimbisāra.
192 Gokhale 1980a: 71 notes that for Vassakāra to be “involved in erecting fortifications” indicates that being a “purohita involved functions well beyond the performance of Brahmanical rituals for the king”;
on the role and functions of the purohita according to the Jātakas cf. also Fick 1897: 107-117.
193 [[AN1999]] 74 explains that “the Buddha’s fundamental position is emphasis on self-discipline based on
Dhamma, not on any authority ... which might serve as a crutch”. Misra 1972: 109 comments that “the
cause of [the] Buddha’s preference for the abstract guidance of dharma to the tangible control by a
leader ... is to be seen in his close acquaintance with and admiration for ... the republican states around
him (from one of which he himself came)”. Thapar 1976/1978: 87-88 points out that in monastic organization “there is an attempt at imitating the structure of the tribal and oligarchic systems”, “it may
be argued that the form adopted was ... in deliberate opposition to the monarchical system and its centralized power”; on this theme cf. also Bechert 1997: 62, Dutt 1957: 13, Ling 1973/1976: 157-163, and
id. 1983: 62.
194 [[MN108]] at MN III 8,11: “the Blessed One was the one to show the path not shown [before] ... and the
disciples now live following this path”, bhagavā ... anakkhātassa maggassa akkhātā ... maggānugā ca
pana etarahi sāvakā viharanti. Horner 1959: 59 note 1 draws attention to the absence of any gloss on
this reference to the Buddha’s role as a teacher of the path in the commentary on the Majjhima-nikāya,
which stands in contrast to two other occurrences of the same passage in [[SN8.7]] at SN I 191,2 (or SN [2]
215 at SN [2] I 411,7) and in [[SN22.58]] at SN III 66,16, where each time the commentary offers a gloss, cf.
Spk I 277,26 and Spk II 278,2. If the commentators thought it worthwhile to comment on two occurrences of this passage in the same Sa�yutta-nikāya, one would expect also a comment on an occurrence of the same passage in the Majjhima-nikāya. Although this is not conclusive, perhaps this passage originally did not form part of [[MN108]] as suggested by its absence in [[MA145]]


Chapter 11 Devadaha-vagga                                    -  625


discourses, constitutes the crucial difference between the Buddha and his arahant disciples, namely the Buddha’s discovery and teaching of the path. [195]
According to both versions, Vassakāra wondered how the Buddhist monks were able
to live in harmony, if they had no leader. [196] In reply to Vassakāra’s inquiry, Ānanda
explained that the monks relied on the Dharma instead of relying on a human leader. [197]
According to the Majjhima-nikāya account, Ānanda explained his statement by describing how on observance days the monks would come together to recite the code of
conduct (pātimokkha) and confess any transgression. [198] The Madhyama-āgama version
adds to this description that on such an occasion one of the monks would give a talk on
the Dharma, to which the other monks would listen with respect and joy. [199]


195 At a later point of its presentation, [[MA145]] at T I 655c27 records a related explanation by Ānanda, in
which he clarified that the liberation of the Buddha and the liberation of an arahant are not different
from each other.
196 According to the commentary on the Mahāparinibbāna-sutta, Sv II 522,19, Vassakāra had been instrumental in sowing discord among the Vajjians in order to enable King Ajātasattu to conquer the Vajjian
republic. This tale would explain why Vassakāra would be interested in the reasons for the concord that
prevailed in the leaderless Buddhist monastic community, a community whose administration appears
to have been modelled by its founder on republican principles similar to those of the Vajjian republic.
Warder 1956: 45 explains that, from the viewpoint of organization, “the Sa�gha ... preserved the ancient democratic institutions of tribes such as the Buddha himself was born among, and which the kings
of Kosala and Magadha were busily extirpating and subjecting to their growing states”.
197 [[MN108]] at MN III 9,23: “we are not without refuge ... we are with refuge ... with the Dharma as refuge”, na kho maya� ... appa�isara�ā, sappa�isara�ā maya� ... dhammapa�isara�ā ti (B [e] -MN III 60,11:
dhammappa�isara�ā) and [[MA145]] at T I 654b23: “we do not rely on a person but rely on the Dharma”,
; cf. also the Mahāvyutpatti 1547 in Sakaki 1926: 124: dharma-pratisara�ena
bhavitavya� na pudgala-pratisara�ena. Dutt 1924/1996: 118 comments on the inquiry preceding this
explanation that “evidently the republican organization of the Buddhist Sangha was somewhat incomprehensible to outsiders”.
198 Notably, [[MN108]] at MN III 10,13 speaks of dealing according to the Dharma with a monk who recalls
having transgressed while the pātimokkha is being recited, tasmi� ce bhaññamāne. [[MA145]] at T I
654b27 is less explicit, reading: “if an impure person is in the assembly, we undertake to instruct him in
accordance with what is set forth in the Dharma”, . Dhirasekera 1982/2007: 196 remarks that the description in [[MN108]] points to an early stage in the recital of the
pātimokkha, when offences were revealed during the actual recitation, instead of being summarily con我等不依於人而依於法 fessed beforehand. The same early stage he also sees reflected in the injunction given as part of the instruction on the formal recitation of the pātimokkha at Vin I 103,2, according to which an offence
should be revealed, yassa siyā āpatti so āvikareyya, asantiyā āpattiyā tu�hī bhavitabba�. Gombrich
1991: 35 explains that although “originally ... the rules were simply recited by the senior monk present
and anyone who had violated any of them was to say so ... but then the monks could not endure the
shame of public confession, so the procedure was changed: monks paired off and confessed to each
other before the public recitation”; cf. also, e.g., Bhagvat 1939: 120, Dutt 1924/1996: 84, Oberlies 1997:
179 note 53, and Vetter 1999: 213. 若彼眾不清淨者, 隨法所說, 我等教作是
199 [[MA145]] at T I 654b25: “if there is a monk who is knowledgeable in the Dharma, we will invite that
monk to teach us the Dharma ... all of us together will delight in what this monk says and received it respectfully”, . This additional stipulation indicates that the purpose of the fortnightly meeting of the monks is not only to en若有比丘知法者, 我等請彼比丘為我等說法 ... 我等一切歡喜奉行彼比丘所說



MN III 10


626   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


MN III 11  The Gopakamoggallāna-sutta and its parallel continue by pointing out that, although no
monk was set up as a leader, an individual monk will be respected by other monks if he
is endowed with ten qualities. [200] The two versions agree in listing the following qualities:

      - proper observance of the rules,

      - learning,

      - contentment. [201]
Both versions, moreover, present the destruction of the influxes as the culmination
point of their list of praiseworthy qualities. Qualities that according to the Majjhima-nikāya presentation make a monk worthy of respect are the ability to attain:

      - the four jhānas,

      - the supernormal powers,

      - the divine ear,

      - knowledge of the mind of others,

      - recollection of past lives,

      - the divine eye.
The Madhyama-āgama version instead reckons as qualities that make a monk worthy
of respect if he:


sure their purity in matters of conduct, but also to provide a platform for exchange on the teachings.
This brings to mind an injunction given the Mahāparinibbāna-sutta and its parallels, according to which
the Dharma and the Vinaya should become the teacher once the Buddha is no longer alive, cf. [[DN16]] at
DN II 154,5: “the Dharma and the discipline taught and set out by me to you, that shall be your teacher
after my passing away”, yo vo ... mayā dhammo ca vinayo ca desito paññatto, so vo mam’ accayena
satthā. Its Tibetan counterpart in Waldschmidt 1951: 387,22 begins by recommending recitation of the
various types of Buddhist scripture and then presents the code of rules, so sor thar pa’i mdo, as the
teacher after the Buddha’s passing away. One of the Chinese parallels to [[DN16]] similarly takes up the
rules, together with morality and the Dharma as the teacher, T 7 at T I 204b29: “morality, the pātimokkha and the other various teachings on the sublime true Dharma, these will then be your great teacher”,
. Two other Chinese parallels to [[DN16]] simply recommend “the discourses and morality” as the refuge after the Buddha’s demise, [[DA2]] at T I 26a27
and T 5 at T I 172b22: . Another parallel, T 6 at T I 188a24, only speaks of the “Dharma teachings”,
, as the refuge. T 6 continues by instructing that when the monks meet for recitation of the rules,
they should also recite the discourses and take refuge in them, . A quotation of this injunction in the *Karmavibha�gopadeśa in Lévi 1932a: 158,4, also speaks only of the discourses: sūtrānta� śāstā.
200 While according to Ee-MN III 10,21 and Se-MN III 93,13 Ānanda affirmed that such a monk exists, atthi, according to B [e] -III 61,6 and C [e] -MN III 104,28 he denied the existence of such a monk, n’ atthi. The
parallel passage in [[MA145]] at T I 654c5 affirms the existences of such a monk,, supporting the read戒波羅提木叉, ing found in E [e] and S 及餘所說種種妙法, [e] . 此即便是汝等大師
201 While [[MN108]] at MN III 11,25 has only a brief reference to contentment (which comes as its third quality), [[MA145]] at T I 655a 經戒 6 illustrates contentment (which is its sixth quality) with the image of a bird that
法教 takes along its two wings wherever it goes, an image used regularly in other Majjhima-nikāya discourses
to illustrate contentment, cf., e.g., [[MN27]] at MN I 180,22, [[MN38]] 誦經, at MN 歸心於經 I 268,34, [[MN51]] at MN I 346,5,
[[MN94]] at MN II 162,8, [[MN101]] at MN II 226,8, and [[MN112]] at MN III 34,26. A counterpart to this
image can be found in Jain texts, cf., e.g., the Uttarājjhaya�[[AN6.15]] in Charpentier 1922: 89,14.

 - acts as a spiritual friend (kalyānamitta), [202]

 - delights in mental and physical seclusion,

 - delights in meditation, [203]

 - is mindful,

 - is energetic,

 - is wise.
Thus, while the Pāli version presents a listing of attainments, the emphasis in the
Chinese parallel is more on a several recommendable qualities (see table 11.7). [204]
After asking Ānanda where he was staying, [205] according to both versions Vassakāra
proposed that the Buddha had spoken in praise of all types of meditation. The two versions differ in the word they use to refer to “meditation”, as the Majjhima-nikāya discourse speaks of jhāna, [206] while the Madhyama-āgama version speaks of “application


202 [[MA145]] at T I 654c25: . To convey the idea of frequenting spiritual friends, other discourses
in the Madhyama-āgama use the expressions “to approach spiritual friends”,, e.g., [[MA153]] at T I 672c28, or “to see spiritual friends”,, e.g., [[MA204]] at T I 778a26.
203 [[MA145]] at T I 655a3 describes how someone “internally properly practices tranquillity, is not separated
from mental investigation and puts into operation insight, increasingly practising emptiness”,
,, expressions that bring to mind the injunction in [[MN6]] at MN I 33,10,
“practising internal tranquillity of mind, not neglecting meditation (jhāna), being endowed with insight,
and being a frequenter of empty places”, ajjhatta� cetosamatham anuyutto anirākatajjhāno vipassanāya samannāgato brūhetā suññāgārāna� (S [e] -MN I 58,9: ajjhattañ), where the parallel [[MA105]] at T I
595c19 refers to this mode of practice as “not neglecting jhāna, putting into operation insight and practising in empty and secluded places 作善知識 ”, .
204 The presentation in [[MA145]] thereby closely resembles a list of ten praiseworthy qualities of a monk 親近善知識
found in [[DN33]] at DN III 266,26, [[DN34]] at DN III 290, 見善知識 13, [[AN10.17]] at AN V 23,12, and [[AN10.50]] at
AN V 89,19. This list mentions observance of the rules (1 [st] ), learning (2 [nd] ), spiritual friends (3 [rd] ), gentle
speech (4 [th] ), skill at carrying out duties for fellow monks (5 [th] ), delight in the Dharma (6 [th] ), contentment 內行正止,
亦不離伺, (7 [th] in the Dīgha-nikāya 成就於觀 增長空行 discourses, 8 [th] in the A�guttara-nikāya discourses), being energetic (8 [th] in the
Dīgha-nikāya discourses, 7 [th] in the A�guttara-nikāya discourses), mindfulness (9 [th] ), and wisdom (10 [th] ).
[[MA145]] has almost the same sequence and differs only in respect to qualities 4, 5, and 6, where instead
of delight in the Dharma [[MA145]] speaks of delight in seclusion and in meditation, and instead of gentle
speech and skill at tasks [[MA145]] has the destruction of the influxes as a quality that makes a monk worthy
of respect. Gentle speech and skill at tasks are found also in a listing of these ten qualities in the 不廢禪, 成就觀行於空靜處 Daśottara-sūtra, cf. fragment 679 folio 23V5+7 in Schlingloff 1962a: 12.
205 A few minor differences are that while according to [[MN108]] at MN III 13,3 Vassakāra expressed his
appreciation of Ānanda’s presentation, according to [[MA145]] at T I 655b1 the whole assembly expressed
their approval. In addition to asking if the Bamboo Grove was quiet, according to [[MA145]] at T I 665b8
Vassakāra also inquired if it was free from insects and flies, a condition that would indeed facilitate the
practice of meditation in this grove. According to [[MN108]] at MN III 13,20, Ānanda remarked that the
conducive conditions in the Bamboo Grove were due to the protection given by Vassakāra. Ps IV 73,3
explains that Vassakāra cared for the Bamboo Grove, as according to a prediction he was going to be
reborn in his next life as a monkey in this grove, a rebirth prospective also referred to in the Karmavibha�ga in Kudo 2004: 72,5 and 73,4 or in Lévi 1932a: 44,22. The reason for the conducive conditions
in the Bamboo Grove given in [[MA145]] at T I 655b14, however, is “because it formerly served as a
shelter for the Blessed One”,
206 [[MN108]] at MN II 13,32: “the venerable Gotama was one who meditated and had the habit of a meditator,
以世尊擁護故.

of the mind”, employing a Chinese character used elsewhere to render the first jhāna
factor vicāra. [207] This part of the discourse has also been preserved in the discourse quotation in Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya, which employs
the standard Tibetan counterpart for jhāna or dhyāna. [208]

In all versions, Ānanda was quick to point out that Vassakāra’s statement was a misunderstanding. He clarified that the Buddha only spoke in praise of types of “medita

the venerable Gotama spoke in praise of all [kinds of] meditation”, jhāyī c’ eva so bhava� gotamo ahosi jhānasīlī ca, sabbañ ca pana so bhava� gotamo jhāna� va��esī ti (S [e] -MN III 98,10: jhānasīlo).
207 [[MA145]] at T I 655b23: “the recluse Gotama was one who practised application of the mind, who delighted in application of the mind, who praised all application of the mind”,
. The character used in the present instance is the standard rendering for vicāra in the Madhyama-āgama, whereas the standard way of rendering jhāna in the same collection is, and the verb
jhāyati, “to meditate”, could easily have been rendered as, or, or even . [[MA145]] at T I
655a3 refers to not neglecting meditation as . This seems rather similar to the expression anirākatajjhāna in [[MN6]] at MN I 33,10, which its parallel [[MA105]] at T I 595c19, however, refers to as
. At a later point, when [[MA145]] at T I 655c15 turns to the four jhānas, it uses the expression, explaining that the four jhānas are the four types of ‘meditation’ (, approved of by the Buddha. Although
the use of both renderings side by side could indicate that the Indic original on which the translator(s)
based their rendering did not use an equivalent to jhāna or jhāyati in the passage concerned with the
five hindrances, it is also possible that the translator(s) deliberately chose 沙門瞿曇行伺, instead of in order to 樂伺, 稱歎
一切伺 better convey the implications of the present passage, where the point at stake is indeed not 伺 jhāna/ in
its proper sense. In fact, from the perspective of transmission the second hypothesis seems more pro- 禪
bable, since it is difficult to imagine that the reciters of what came to be the Pāli version of the present 禪作 禪行 禪坐
discourse would have replaced another term with 不離伺 jhāna in a context that does not fit the use of the expression jhāna in other discourses. This assumption finds further support in the Abhidharmakośabhā� 不廢  禪 ya, Abhidh-k 8:2 in Pradhan 1967: 433,12, which in a quote related to the present discourse (cf. also 禪
above note 188) speaks of “unwholesome dhyānas taught by the Blessed One 伺) ”, uktāni cākuśalāni dhyānānyapi bhagavatā (cf. also T 1558 at T XXIX 145b21: and T 1559 at T XXIX
296c13: ).

tion” during which the mind was not overwhelmed by the five hindrances. [209] The use
of different terminology to render the same basic idea of “meditation” in the parallel
versions is interesting in so far as the Gopakamoggallāna-sutta seems to be the only
Pāli discourse in which the term jhāna stands for a mental condition in which the hindrances are present. [210] The three versions agree that Ānanda described the mind being
overwhelmed by the hindrances without knowing an escape from this condition, a mental condition far from being anywhere near the complete absence of the hindrances
experienced during real jhāna. [211]
In both versions Vassakāra approved of Ānanda’s explanation and left. The Majjhima-nikāya version concludes with Ānanda repeating the reply he had already earlier
given to Gopakamoggallāna’s initial question and then ends without the standard conclusion to a discourse (which usually reports the delight of the listeners).
According to the Madhyama-āgama version, however, the discussion continued, as
Gopakamoggallāna inquired if there was a difference between the liberation of the
Buddha and the liberation of an arahant, which Ānanda denied. [212] Gopakamoggallāna

209 [[MA145]] at T I 655c7 actually omits restlessness-and-worry, thereby mentioning only four hindrances.
As the whole point of the passage is to set a contrast to the jhānas, which require the removal of all five
hindrances, the absence of restless-and-worry may be the result of an oversight during the transmission,
translation, or copying of the discourse. D (4094) mngon pa, nyu 67b7 or Q (5595) thu 111b8 mentions
in fact all five hindrances.
210 In addition to its standard occurrence in relation to the four levels of mental absorption, the word jhāna
occasionally has the more general sense of “meditation”. This is the case, e.g., in the expression arittajjhāna, “not lacking ‘jhāna’”, which [[AN1.150]] at AN I 38-43 applies among others also to meditation
practices such as satipa��hāna and the six recollections, practices that tradition does not consider as
leading to jhāna attainment on their own. A more general sense of jhāna seems to underlie also the expression anirākatajjhāna, “not neglecting ‘jhāna’”, found in [[MN6]] at MN I 33,10, cf. also It 2:8 at It
39,11, in between the two qualities of cetosamatha and vipassanā. [[MN36]] at MN I 243,5 refers to breath
control as appānaka jhāna (B [e] -MN I 309,16, C [e] -MN I 576,28, and S [e] -MN I 451,12: appā�aka), where
again the more general sense of “meditation” appears to fit the context best. Yet, none of these instances associates the term jhāna with the presence of the hindrances. Such an instance can be found,
however, in a tale in the Mahāvastu in Senart 1897: 149,2. This tale describes how the son of a hermit,
fallen in love at his first encounter with a beautiful girl, keeps thinking of her instead of doing his duties in the hermitage. This causes his father to ask him what occupies his mind with the words kin tuva� dhyāna� dhyāyasi (Basak 1968/2004: 92,6: ki�), “what ‘dhyāna’ are your meditating on?” Notably, the Pāli counterpart in Jā 526 at Jā V 201,26 reads rather kin nu mando va jhāyasi? For a detailed
study of the different versions of this tale cf. Lüders 1940b.
211 A similar description of a state of mind overwhelmed by the hindrances can be found in [[AN11.10]] at
AN V 323,14, which makes use of the same verb “to meditate”, jhāyati, without, however, bringing in
the noun jhāna. Its parallel [[SA926]] at T II 236a2 also does not use the equivalent term in relation to
the hindrances. Only when it comes to describing meditation free from the hindrances does [[SA926]] at T
II 236a11 employ the term . Thus [[MN108]] stands out for using the noun jhāna in a way that appears
to be unique in the early discourses.
212 [[MA145]] at T I 655c28: the “complete and full liberation and liberation by wisdom [of a Buddha], and
the liberation of an arahant, what is the difference between these two liberations”,
(adopting the variant reading instead of )? On following
the alternative reading, the passage could also be interpreted to intend three types of liberation: com禪

then invited Ānanda to partake of a meal. At the end of the meal, Ānanda gave Gopakamoggallāna a talk on the Dharma. The Madhyama-āgama discourse concludes with
Gopakamoggallāna’s delighted reaction. [213]


[[MN109]] Mahāpu��ama-sutta

The Mahāpu��ama-sutta, the “greater discourse on a full moon [night]”, offers a detailed examination of the five aggregates. This discourse recurs in the Sa�yutta-nikāya and has a parallel in the Sa�yukta-āgama, [214] in addition to which a quotation of the
present discourse has been preserved in Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya. [215]

MN III 16  The Mahāpu��ama-sutta and its parallels record in closely similar terms a question
and answer exchange between a monk and the Buddha, [216] which clarifies that the five


plete and full liberation, liberation by wisdom, and liberation of an arahant. However, whereas it would
make sense to inquire after the difference between the liberation of a Buddha and the liberation of an
arahant, to take the passage to inquire about the differences between three types of liberation would
make less sense. “Liberation by wisdom” is one mode of arriving at arahant-ship and would thus need
to be contrasted with the alternative mode of arriving at arahant-ship that leads to being liberated “bothways”, but would not provide a contrast to the “liberation of an arahant”.
213 Although this last exchange is not found in the Pāli version, it would fit the sequence of events quite
well. According to both discourses, Ānanda had originally set out to collect alms, but on realizing that
it was yet too early he had approached the workplace of Gopakamoggallāna. Due to the arrival of Vassakāra the discussion had been prolonged and by the time of Vassakāra’s departure it could well have
become high time for Ānanda to approach the town in order to beg his alms so as to be able to partake
of food before noon. In view of this situation, it would be a thoughtful gesture by Gopakamoggallāna to
invite Ānanda to take a meal right where he was. The fact that the Pāli version ends rather abruptly,
without the standard ending for a discourse, leaves open the possibility that a similar concluding narration earlier formed part of the discourse and was lost during the process of transmission.
214 [[SN22.82]] at SN III 100-104 and [[SA58]] at T II 14b-15b, which agrees with the Pāli versions on locating
the discourse in the Hall of Migāra’s Mother. [[SN22.82]] has the title Pu��ama, thereby agreeing with
[[MN109]] on the title except for the specification “greater”. [[SA58]] (or at least the first part of [[SA58]]) has
the title, given in the uddāna at T II 15b2. renders “aggregate(s) [affected by] clinging”,
cf., e.g., [[SA58]] at T II 14b23. For [[SA58]] to differ from the Pāli versions in regard to the title is not surprising, since while the Pāli versions take place on a full-moon night, [[SA58]] at T II 14b13 specifies that
the discourse took place in the afternoon,, so that it is only natural that [[SA58]] does not refer to a
full-moon night in its title.
215 Abhidh-k-� at D (4094) mngon pa, nyu 54a1-57a2 or Q (5595) thu 95a3-99a1; cf. also Abhidh-k 7:13 in
Pradhan 1967: 400,16, paralleling [[MN109]] at MN III 16,12, with its Chinese counterparts in T 1558 at
T XXIX 137a26 and T 1559 at T XXIX 288b20 (cf. the full quote below in note 217). Abhidh-k-� agrees
with the other versions on the location.
216 Ps IV 77,1 explains that this monk was an arahant who did not ask these questions out of personal ignorance. While in [[MN109]] at MN III 15, 陰即受 29 and [[SN22.82]] at SN III 100, 陰即受 16 the first question he asks is
whether the five aggregates are material form, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness, which the Buddha confirms, [[SA58]] at T II 14b14 and D (4094) mngon pa, nyu 54a3 or Q (5595)
thu 95a5 follow the opposite sequence, with the Buddha at first making this statement on his own, after 晡時
which the monk stands up and formulates the same as a question.


Chapter 11 Devadaha-vagga                                    -  631


aggregates [affected by] clinging are rooted in desire, [217] followed by pointing out that
clinging is neither identical with the five aggregates nor something apart from them,
but consists in desire in regard to them.
The Mahāpu��ama-sutta and its parallels indicate that such desire could be directed
towards future manifestations of any of the five aggregates. They continue by defining
the term aggregate in the same way, followed by offering the same type of definition
for each of the five aggregates.
The Pāli versions next take up the arising of a sense of identity (sakkāyadi��hi) in
regard to the aggregates [affected by] clinging, after which they examine the gratification, danger, and release in regard to them. The Chinese and Tibetan versions take up
the same two topics, although they tackle them in the opposite sequence.
The Pāli and Tibetan versions explain that in regard to each aggregate a sense of
identity can arise, which can take place by:

 - taking the aggregate to be the self,

 - postulating the self as the owner of the aggregate,

 - assuming the aggregate to exist within the self,

 - locating the self within the aggregate.
The Chinese version makes the same point, although its presentation adopts a somewhat abbreviated manner of presentation. [218]


217 While [[MN109]] at MN III 16,12 and [[SN22.82]] at SN III 100,26 simply indicate that the five aggregates
are “rooted in desire”, chandamūlaka, [[SA58]] at T II 14b22 draws out the same in more detail by explaining that they are “rooted in desire, arisen from desire, born from desire, contacted by desire”,
; cf. also its counterpart in D (4094) mngon pa, nyu 54b1 or Q (5595) thu 95b6:
“rooted in desire, completely arisen from desire, akin to desire, and produced by desire”,’dun pa’i rtsa
ba can, ’dun pa las kun ’byung ba, ’dun pa dang ’dra ba, dun pa las rab tu skye ba dag yin no. Abhidh-k 7:13 in Pradhan 1967: 400,16 qualifies the five aggregates to be chandamūlakāś chandasamudayāś chandajātīyāś chandaprabhavā; cf. also T 1558 at T XXIX 137a26:
, and T 1559 at T XXIX 288b20: .
218 The Tibetan version has a reading that closely correspond to the Pāli versions, D (4094) mngon pa, nyu
55b5 or Q (5595) thu 97a7: gzugs la bdag go ... bdag gzugs dang ldan pa dang, bdag la gzugs yod, gzugs
la bdag yod. [[SA58]] at T II 14c29 differs, in as much as it speaks just of,,, “seeing [as]
self, [as] other [than] self, [as] existing [in relation] to each other”. Choong 2000: 59 draws attention to 欲為
two 根, 欲集, Sa�yukta-āgama 欲生, 欲觸 discourses that help to clarify this expression. [[SA45]] at T II 11b5 describes the
viewing of self in regard to the aggregate of form as . [[SA109]] at T
II 34b13 refers to the same in a slightly more abbreviated manner as .
Thus and refer to identifying the aggregate as self and to taking the aggregate to be owned
by the self, corresponding to rūpam attato samanupassati and rūpavanta� vā attāna� 以欲為根, 以欲為集, (in the case of 以欲
為類, the aggregate of form) in [[MN109]] at MN III 17, 以欲為生 27 依欲為根, . The expression 依欲為集, 依欲為生,, “existing [in relation] to each 依欲為有
other”, appears to be an abbreviated representation of (in the case of the aggregate of
form) and corresponds to attani vā rūpa�, rūpasmi� vā attāna� in [[MN109]] at MN III 17,28. This understanding is also found in a gloss in the Sa�yukta-āgama edition p. 33 note 2, which explains 見我 異我 相在
that stands for,,, . The Madhyama-āgama presentation of the same type of contemplation, found, e.g., in [[MA210]] at T I 788a28 (parallel to [[MN44]] at MN
I 300,7), employs the more easily intelligible formulation 見色是我, 色異我, 我在色, 色在我
. As Choong 2000: 58 points out, the Sa�yukta-āgama uses the same cryptic expression 見色是我, 異我, 我在色, 色在我,
見我 異我
相在
我在色, 色在我

MN III 17


632   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


MN III 18  While the Pāli versions next inquire how to go beyond identification and conceit in
regard to the body and external signs, [219] the Sa�yukta-āgama discourse and the discourse quotation in Śamathadeva’s commentary examine how to reach the destruction
of the influxes. [220] In spite of differing formulations, the parallel versions have obviously the same goal of full awakening in view.
The Pāli, Chinese, and Tibetan versions agree that to reach this goal requires the removal of any identification with the five aggregates and to leave behind any appropriation of them.

MN III 19  The four versions report that, while hearing these instructions, a monk had the deluded thought that, given the absence of a self, there was nobody to whom karmic retribution would apply. [221] On becoming aware of this thought, the Buddha delivered a
standard catechism on the impermanent, unsatisfactory, and self-less nature of the five
aggregates. [222]


, not only to represent the four modes of viewing a self in regard to any of the five aggregates, but also to represent the threefold mode “mine, I, my self”.
219 [[MN109]] at MN III 18,31 inquires how to practise so that “in this body with its consciousness and externally in all signs there is no ‘I’-making, no ‘my’-making and no underlying tendency to conceit”, imasmiñ ca saviññā�ake kāye bahiddhā ca sabbanimittesu aha�kāramama�kāramānānusayā na hontī ti
(C [e] -MN III 120,29: ahi�kāramami�kāramānānusayā, S [e] -MN III 105,18: aha�kāramama�kāramānānusayā), a formulation found similarly in [[SN22.82]] at SN III 103,10.
220 [[SA58]] at T II 15a6 inquires after attaining the “destruction of the influxes”,, with its equivalent in
zag pa zad pa in D (4094) mngon pa, nyu 56a2 or Q (5595) thu 97b5.
221 [[MN109]] at MN III 19,12: “deeds done by not-self, what self could they affect”, anattakatāni kammāni,
異我 kam attāna� phusissantī ti 相在 ? [[SN22.82]] at SN III 103,27 reads instead katam attāna� phusissantī ti (B [e]   SN II 85,10 and C [e] -SN III 176,13: katham attāna�, S [e] -SN III 126,11: kammattāna�). [[SA58]] at T II
15a12: “[if] deeds are done by no self, then who will receive the retribution in the future”,
? D (4094) mngon pa, nyu 56a6 or Q (5595) thu 98a4: “there being no self, in
what way will deeds done by oneself be experienced”, bdag med pas byas pa bdag gis ji ltar myong
bar ’gyur? [[SA58]] at T II 15a11 differs from [[MN109]] and [[SN22.82]] in as much as it qualifies the monk
as “unwise”,, and to be one who had “given rise to an evil and wrong view”,, qualifications similarly made in D (4094) mngon pa, nyu 56a5 or Q (5595) thu 98a2 漏盡 : mi mkhas pa and sdig pa
can gyi lta bar gyur pa.
222 According to [[MN109]] at MN III 19,20, the Buddha introduced this catechism by proclaiming that he
had “trained” the monks “in conditions ... here and there in these and those things”, pa�icca vinītā ...
tatra tatra tesu tesu dhammesu (B [e] -MN III 69,25: pa�ivinītā ... tatra tatra dhammesu, C [e] -MN III
122,11: pa�icca vinītā ... tatra tatra dhammesu, and S [e] -MN III 106,19: pa�ipucchāmi vinītā ... tatra tatra 作無我業,
於未來世, dhammesu; cf. also Pérez-remón 1980: 255), 誰當受報 which in [[SN22.82]] at SN III 104,1 reads “through counter
questioning ... here and there in these things”, pa�ipucchā vinītā ... tatra tatra tesu dhammesu (B [e] -SN II
85,17, C [e] -SN III 176,20, and S [e] -SN III 126,17 read tatra tatra tesu tesu dhammesu). [[SA58]] does not
have this initial proclamation at all. In the Tibetan version, the Buddha just indicates that the monks 無知 起惡邪見
have been trained by him, without specifying in what they have been trained, D (4094) mngon pa, nyu
56b2 or Q (5595) thu 98a7. The expression pa�ipucchā vinītā recurs in [[AN4.6]] at AN I 73,16, where it
stands for discussing with others and explaining to each other the deep discourses related to emptiness.
The occurrence of pa�icca in some Pāli editions brings to mind another occasion described in several
sources, where a group of Brahmins and householders are also confused as to how rebirth can take
place without a self, in reply to which the Buddha delivers a teaching on dependent arising, cf. [[MA62]]

## Chapter 12 Anupada-vagga

[[MN111]] Anupada-sutta

The Anupada-sutta, the “discourse on step by step [insight meditation]”, [1] records Sāriputta’s development of insight based on the jhānas and immaterial attainments. Of
this discourse, no parallel seems to have been identified so far.


[[MN112]] Chabbisodhana-sutta [2]
The Chabbisodhana-sutta, the “discourse on six-fold purity”, describes how to check
someone’s claim to having reached full awakening. This discourse has a parallel in the
Madhyama-āgama. [3]
The Chabbisodhana-sutta and its parallel in the Madhyama-āgama take up the case of
a monk who claims to have reached full awakening. In such a case, the other monks
should investigate this claim by questioning the claimant on various topics.
The two discourses agree that, on being questioned, a monk who is an arahant will indicate that he is neither attracted nor repelled in regard to what is seen, heard, sensed, and

3 The parallel is [[MA187]] at T I 732a-734a, which has the title “discourse on a declaration of [final] knowledge”,, and agrees with [[MN112]] on locating the discourse in Jeta’s Grove by Sāvatthī. For a remark on [[MA187]] cf. Minh Chau 1964/1991: 31; for a translation of [[MA187]] together with extracts from
the present study, cf. Anālayo 2008e. A discourse quotation paralleling the four vohāras mentioned in
[[MN112]] at MN III 29,30 can be found in Abhidh-k 4:74 in Pradhan 1967: 245,8, with its Chinese counterparts in T 1558 at T XXIX 87b18 and T 1559 at T XXIX 242c11 (for the full quotes cf. note 4 below),

can be found in [[DN33]] at DN III 232, 說智經 7; cf. also Caillat 1984b: 68. It is noteworthy that in this way [[MA187]] has, “to know”, where [[MN112]] has viññāta, “cognized”, and then [[MA187]] uses, which elsewhere stands for being “conscious”, where [[MN112]] has muta, what is “experienced”. According to Vin
IV 2,25, muta refers to what is experienced by the sense-organs nose, tongue, and body, whereas viññāta
refers to what is experienced by the mind, an explanation also found in the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, T
1428 at T XXII 634b6. This would square with the circumstance that muta or mata precedes viññāta or
vijñāta, thereby concurring with the general sequence of listing the sense-organs, although Vetter 2000:
101 note 7 suggests that the order di��ha, suta, muta, and viññāta “is better explained by the Waxing
Syllable Principle ... etymologically, muta rather points to ‘experienced by the [‘sense organ’] mind’, 一曰見見說, 二曰聞聞說, 三曰識識說, 四曰知知

sodhana-sutta and its parallel differ, however, in as much as they turn to this topic at different junctions of their exposition (see below table 12.1). [5] Both versions recommend
that the other monks should approve of such detachment and rejoice in it, after which
they are to continue their investigation.
While in the Madhyama-āgama version such rejoicing takes place already at the time
of the monk’s first proclamation to have reached the goal, [6] according to the Majjhimanikāya version such an initial declaration should not be approved of, nor should it be
rejected. [7] Thus, from the perspective of the Majjhima-nikāya discourse, a monk’s proclamation of having become an arahant should only be approved of after an investigation of this claim has been undertaken, whereas in the Madhyama-āgama version such
a claim meets with approval right away and will then be scrutinized. [8]


189 note 36 draws attention to an Ekottarika-āgama Sanskrit fragment in Ōkubo 1982: 105,27, which has
the same set, d���e d���avādinī śrute mate vijñāte vijñātavādinī (cf. also ibid. p. 107,14). A discourse quotation in Abhidh-k 4:74 in Pradhan 1967: 245,8 of the same set in its ‘ignoble’ manifestation reads ad���e

same pattern, even though their rendering of muta or mata by is at first sight puzzling. The sequence 不見言見, 不聞言聞, 不覺

8 In view of the possibility that such claims can be mistaken, the more cautious attitude evinced in the Pāli
version would be reasonable in such circumstances, cf., e.g., [[MN105]] at MN II 252,20 and its counterparts in SHT IV 32 folio 25R6 (p. 125) and SHT IV 165 folio 6R4-5 (p. 182), according to which the claim
of some monks to being arahants was an overestimation of their own progress. That such a claim should
at first be thoroughly investigated would also be more in accordance with [[MN47]] at MN I 318,3 and its
parallel [[MA186]] at T I 731b9, which recommend that a monk should carry out a prolonged and detailed
investigation even before coming to the conclusion that the Buddha was fully awakened. 不高不下, 不倚不縛,

Another topic to be investigated regarding a claim to full awakening is the claimant’s
attitude towards the five aggregates. The two versions agree that, as a result of having
seen their impermanent and unreliable nature, [9] an arahant is thoroughly detached from
the five aggregates. [10] The Chabbisodhana-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel also
take up the six elements - the four material elements, space, and consciousness – highlighting that an arahant has fully realized their not-self nature. [11]
Another topic for investigation is the claimant’s attitude towards the six senses. While
the Majjhima-nikāya version explicitly mentions the respective objects of the senses,
its Madhyama-āgama parallel does not include them in its presentation. [12] The two versions agree, however, that an arahant is completely detached in regard to each of these
six senses. [13]
The Chabbisodhana-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel culminate their examination by describing the gradual path of training up to the attainment of the four jhānas
and the destruction of the influxes in order to account for an arahant’s transcendence of
all patterns of identification in regard to body and mind. [14]

9 [[MN112]] at MN III 30,31 speaks of having seen each aggregate to be “without strength”, abala. The corresponding passage in [[MA187]] at T I 732b2 reads “without result”, which might be due to a mistaking of abala, “without strength”, for aphala, “without result”.
10 [[MN112]] at MN III 30,31 and [[MA187]] at T I 732b3.
11 [[MN112]] at MN III 31,23 and [[MA187]] at T I 733a2. As noted by Schayer 1935: 125, the listing of these
six elements is based on “a ‘graduated scale’ of subtleness, as Air is subtler than Water, so is Ether
subtler than Air, and Consciousness than Ether”; for a comparable graduation cf. Taittirīya Upani�ad
2.1.1, whose account of evolution proceeds from the self via space and the other elements up to earth;
cf. also Wynne 2007: 36.
12 In the case of the sense-organ eye, for example, [[MN112]] at MN III 32,16 lists the eye, form, eye-consciousness, and the things to be cognised by eye-consciousness, cakkhusmi� ... rūpe, cakkhuviññā�e,
cakkhuviññā�aviññātabbesu dhammesu, while [[MA187]] at T I 732c19 非果, only speaks of the eye, eye-consciousness, and the things to be cognised by eye-consciousness, . Here [[MA187]]
seems more economic, since once “things to be cognised by eye-consciousness” are taken into account,
to mention “form” would be redundant. Ps IV 93,22 attempts to explain this redundancy by suggesting
that “form”, etc., refers to what is actually cognised, while the expression “things to be cognised by eyeconsciousness”, etc., refers to what could have been cognised but has disappeared (or will disappear)
without being cognised. This explanation is not convincing, since it would be irrelevant to describe the
reaction of an arahant to what he or she does not experience at all. The commentary offers also another
explanation, according to which “things to be cognised by eye-consciousness”, etc., refer to the aggregates of feeling, perception, and volitional formation that are present together with eye-consciousness
during the act of cognition, while “form”, etc., refers to the object. This also does not seem to work too
well, since the aggregates of feeling, perception, and formation are not cognisable by eye-consciousness 眼及眼識, 眼識知法
or any of the other types of sense-consciousness, so that apart from “form” there would be little scope to
find anything that could be fitted into the category “things to be cognised by eye-consciousness”.
13 [[MN112]] at MN III 32,17 and [[MA187]] at T I 732c19, which does not bring in the underlying tendencies
and adherences mentioned in the formulation found in [[MN112]]
14 [[MN112]] at MN III 32,33 and [[MA187]] at T I 733a13. The accounts of the gradual path in [[MN112]] and
[[MA187]] show the same minor differences between Majjhima-nikāya and Madhyama-āgama discourses
noted above p. 190 in regard to the section on morality, p. 619 in regard to sense-restraint, and p. 82 in
regard to the practice of mindfulness and clear comprehension.

638   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


MN III 36  The Majjhima-nikāya version indicates that at this point the other monks can come to
the conclusion that the interrogated monk’s claim to full awakening is genuine. According to the Madhyama-āgama version, however, the monks had already been satisfied with the first answer; they had kept on inquiring only because they wanted to witness the skill and wisdom of the interrogated monk. [15]
The Chabbisodhana-sutta’s treatment concludes at this point. In spite of speaking of
a six-fold purity in its title, it presents only five aspects of the purity of an arahant. The
Pāli commentary attempts to arrive at six types of purity by applying the freedom from
I-making, my-making, and conceit to oneself as well as to others. [16] Based on dividing
this type of purity into two, the commentary suggests, a final count of six types of purity can be made. This does not seem to solve the problem successfully, as some of the
other types of purity, taken up in the Chabbisodhana-sutta, could also be applied to
oneself and others, so that a consistent application of this mode of interpretation would
result in more than six purities.
The commentary also records another opinion, which it attributes to the “elders that
live on the other side of the sea”. [17] According to the explanation of these elders, the purity of an arahant’s attitude towards the four nutriments should be taken into account.
This explanation is puzzling, since although in this way a sixth type of purity would indeed be obtained, the Chabbisodhana-sutta does not refer at all to the four nutriments.


Table 12.1: Listing of Purities in [[MN112]] and [[MA187]]

|[[MN112]]|[[MA187]]|
|---|---|
|seen, heard, sensed, cognised (1)<br>5 aggregates (2)<br>6 elements (3)<br>6 senses (4)<br>sense of ‘I’/gradual path (5)<br>|5 aggregates (→ 2)<br>4 nutriments<br>seen, heard, sensed, cognised (→ 1)<br>6 senses (→ 4)<br>6 elements (→ 3)<br>sense of ‘I’/gradual path (→ 5)|



The solution to this puzzle can be found in the Madhyama-āgama discourse, which
in addition to the five purities covered in both discourses also takes up an arahant’s attitude towards the four nutriments. According to the Madhyama-āgama account, an
arahant will be completely detached in regard to the four nutriments of food, contact,
intention, and consciousness. [18] Thus the Madhyama-āgama discourse does indeed have
an exposition that results in a six-fold purity (see above table 12.1).


15 [[MA187]] at T I 734a22.
16 Ps IV 94,19.
17 Ps IV 94,23: parasamuddavāsī therā. An extract from the present discussion already appeared in Anālayo 2005c: 104-105.
18 [[MA187]] at T I 732b18. The four nutriments also occur together with the elements, the aggregates, and
the senses in the description of an arahant’s detachment in the Saundaranandakāvya 18:18 in Johnston
1928: 136,5.


Chapter 12 Anupada-vagga                                    -  639


Judging from the title of the Pāli version, it seems safe to assume that at an earlier
time a similar examination of the four nutriments was part of the Chabbisodhana-sutta.
The “elders that live on the other side of the sea”, mentioned in the Pāli commentary,
were apparently still familiar with the earlier version that included the four nutriments,
a treatment lost at some point during or after the transmission of the Pāli discourse from
India to Sri Lanka.
From the perspective of the transmission of the early discourses, this apparent loss of
a part of the Pāli discourse and the commentarial gloss on this loss are noteworthy. Although the present case shows that even a considerable part of a discourse could be lost,
it also reveals the degree to which the reciting monks were committed to preserving a
discourse exactly as they had received it. It would have been easy for the reciters to
supply the missing section about the four nutriments on the strength of the discourse’s title and the commentarial explanation, or alternatively to change the title to “five-fold
purity” in order to make it fit with the discourse’s content. This evidently did not happen and the Pāli discourse was instead handed down in its present truncated state. This
testifies to the fidelity of the reciters and their earnest efforts, albeit not always successful,
to pass on a discourse the way they had received it.


[[MN113]] Sappurisa-sutta

The Sappurisa-sutta, the “discourse on the worthy man”, contrasts the detached attitude of a worthy man with the conceit and self-praise of an unworthy man. This discourse
has three Chinese parallels, one of which is found in the Madhyama-āgama, another in
the Ekottarika-āgama, while the third Chinese parallel is an individual translation. [19]
The Sappurisa-sutta and its parallels begin by describing how an unworthy man feels
conceit and looks down on others because he stems from a high family. [20] The Majjhima-nikāya version, the Madhyama-āgama version, and the individual translation contrast this with a worthy man, who reflects that greed, anger, and delusion will not be eradicated simply because one comes from a high family. [21] The worthy man further reflects


19 The parallels are [[MA85]] at T I 561a-562a, [[EA17.9]] at T II 585a-c, and T 48 at T I 837c-838c, all of which
agree with [[MN113]] on locating the discourse in Jeta’s Grove by Sāvatthī. [[MA85]] also agrees with [[MN113]] on the title ( ), while T 48 has the title “discourse spoken by the Buddha on what is Dharma
and what is not Dharma”, . According to the information given in the Taishō edition, T
48 was translated by Ān Shìgāo ( ) and stems from an original that belonged to a Madhyama-āgama collection, (a specification not recorded in the,, and editions). [[EA17.9]] has been
translated by Huyen-Vi 1994: 157-160.
20 [[MN113]] at MN III 37,10 speaks of the sappurisa, which has its counterpart in [[MA85]] at T I 561a23 in
the “true man”,, and in T 48 at T I 837c26 in the “worthy one”, . [[EA17.9]] at T II 585a19 instead contrasts the “spiritual friend”,, with the “evil friend”,, expressions that would
correspond to kalyā�amitta and pāpamitta in Pāli.
21 This reflection is not found in [[EA17.9]] The presentation in [[EA17.9]] also differs in that it first examines
all the negative types of conduct or attitude, after which it takes up all their positive counterparts. In re- 真人經
lation to birth from a high family, [[EA17.9]] at T II 585b 佛說是法非法經 11 indicates that the good friend does not look

MN III 37


640   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


that even someone from a low family, as long as he practises in accordance with the
Dharma, is praiseworthy on that account. The Majjhima-nikāya version points out that
by reflecting in this way the worthy man gives priority to the practice, [22] while the Madhyama-āgama account notes that in this way he will truly attain the Dharma. [23]

MN III 38  The Sappurisa-sutta repeats the same treatment for the case of being from a great
family, a rich family, and a wealthy family. Such variations are not taken up in its Chinese parallels (see table 12.2). [24] Instead of various types of family, the Madhyama-āgama discourse and the individual translation examine the case of priding oneself on being
handsome. [25]
The Sappurisa-sutta continues by taking up the arising of conceit because of fame or
because of obtaining requisites. The topic of fame recurs only in the Madhyama-āgama
version and in the individual translation, [26] while the gain of requisites is taken up only
in the Ekottarika-āgama version. [27]

MN III 39  The Majjhima-nikāya discourse next turns to knowledge of the Dharma, which it examines from three complementary perspectives in terms of:

       - having heard much,

       - having expertise in the Vinaya,

       - being able to preach the Dharma. [ 28]


down on others as he realizes that this does not really entail a difference between others and himself,
; in relation to the other possible instances for developing conceit, the good friend realizes that these
do not entail any “better or worse” between others and himself, [[EA17.9]] at T I 585b14+18+21+26:
.
22 [[MN113]] at MN III 38,1: “being mainly concerned with the path”, pa�ipada� yeva antara� karitvā, adopting the translation suggested in CPD I: 241 s.v. antara�.
23 [[MA85]] at T I 561b2: “in this way he advances towards being one who attains the true Dharma”,
. T 48 does not offer any comment in this respect.
24 After mentioning the “high family”, uccākula, [[MN113]] at MN III 38,5 takes up the “great family”, mahākula, the “vastly wealthy family”, mahābhogakula, and the “outstandingly wealthy family”, u�ārabhogakula. Once a “high family” has been taken into account, one may wonder what additional perspec- 無
有異 tive an examination of the case of a “great family” can shed on the issue of conceit, and it seems even
more difficult to find a difference between a “vastly wealthy family” and an “outstandingly wealthy 無(有)
family 增減 ”, so that the presentation in [[MN113]] appears to some degree redundant. Ps IV 98,18 suggests that
the uccākulā refers only to warriors and nobles, while the mahākulā covers warriors, nobles, and also
merchants. Again, while the mahābhogakulā is “endowed with great wealth”, mahantehi bhogehi samannāgata, the u�ārabhogakulā is endowed with “outstanding and excellent wealth”, u�ārehi pa�itehi bho 如是趣       向得真諦法者 gehi. This attempt to give a different meaning to the members of these two pairs seems a little contrived.
25 [[MA85]] at T I 561b4 and T 48 at T I 838a7. Compared to the listing of different families in [[MN113]] handsomeness would indeed be worth separate mentioning as an occasion for developing pride. A comparable
description of various occasions for the arising of conceit in the Śrāvakabhūmi also mentions handsomeness, cf. Shukla 1973: 147,17 or ŚSG 1998: 252,6 and T 1579 at T XXX 420b18.
26 [[MA85]] at T I 561b17 and T 48 at T I 838a23.
27 [[EA17.9]] at T II 585b6. The corresponding section in [[EA17.9]] is quite short in comparison, as it covers
only five topics, namely being from a high family, being energetic in relation to moral conduct, being
concentrated, being foremost in wisdom, and obtaining requisites.
28 [[MN113]] at MN III 39,18+31 and MN III 40,9 lists bahussuta, vinayadhara, and dhammakathika.

The Madhyama-āgama version and the individual translation present the topic of
having knowledge of the Dharma in terms of knowledge of the discourses and of the


642   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


Vinaya, [29] in addition to which at an earlier point they refer to eloquence in speech. [30]
Although their description of such eloquence does not explicitly refer to preaching the
Dharma, this might be implicit, since the occasion for a monk to pride himself on his
eloquence could easily arise when he engages in preaching the Dharma.

MN III 40  The same three versions agree in taking up various ascetic practices, such as:

       - wearing rag robes,

       - begging food,

       - taking a single meal,

       - dwelling at the root of a tree,

       - dwelling in a cemetery,

       - dwelling out in the open. [31]
The Ekottarika-āgama version does not mention any of these practices, but only
speaks of energetically keeping the precepts. [32]

MN III 42 The Sappurisa-sutta next considers the four jhānas and the four immaterial attainments as possible instances for the arising of conceit. Here, too, the worthy man does
not praise himself or look down on others due to such attainments, although the reasoning behind his attitude differs from the previously mentioned fame, gains, knowledge,
or ascetic practices. Whereas earlier the point was to reflect that these qualities or practices do not in themselves ensure the removal of greed, anger, or delusion, in relation to
the four jhānas and the four immaterial attainments the worthy man reminds himself
that the Buddha recommended non-identification with such attainments, since things
inevitably will turn out to be different from the way one imagines them to be. [33]


29 [[MA85]] at T I 561b27 speaks of “reciting the discourses and remembering the Vinaya”,, and
T 48 at T I 838b4 speaks of one who “has heard and knows the discourses, is able to proclaim the discourses, knows the Vinaya, and knows [how to] enter into and penetrate the [meaning of the] discourses”,
. [[MA85]] at T I 561b27 additionally also mentions his being “trained in
the Abhidharma”, and being “knowledgeable in the Āgamas and well learned in the collection
of discourses”, .
30 [[MA85]] at T I 561b10 and T 48 at T I 838a14.
31 Two practices mentioned only in [[MN113]] at MN III 42,5 are the practice of continuous sitting (i.e. never
lying down to rest), nesajjika, and the practice of accepting any type of seat or lodging, yathāsanthatika.
In relation to begging, [[MA85]] at T I 561c14 and T 48 at T I 838b14 specify that this implies to go at
most to seven houses. On variations in listings of the ascetic practices cf., e.g., Bapat 1937a, Dantinne 誦經, 持律
1991: 24-30, Ganguly 1989: 21-23, and Ray 1994: 293-323; cf. also Boucher 2008: 191 note 8, who
notes a reference to a twelve-fold listing in [[EA4.2]] at T II 557b8: . A listing of eleven ascetics
知聞經能說經, practices can be found in the same collection in [[EA49.2]] at T II 795a 知律, 知入通經 26; cf. also [[EA49.3]] at T II 795c10.
32 [[EA17.9]] at T II 585a 學阿毘曇, 27 speaks of “energetically keeping the precepts”, (the descriptions of
this quality show some variations, of which the present instance seems to be the one that fits the context 諳阿含慕, 多學經書
best).
33 According to [[MN113]] at MN III 42,28, even in relation to such attainment “the Blessed One has spoken
of non-identification, as ‘in whatever way one may conceive, it turns out to be otherwise’”, atammayatā
vuttā bhagavatā, yena yena hi maññanti tato ta� hoti aññathā ti (S [e] -MN III 141,8: agammayatā). Regarding atammayatā, Ñā�ananda 2005: 317 explains that “tammaya ... is derived from tad maya, literally ‘made of that’”, hence atammayatā highlights how due to grasping one “practically becomes one”

While the Ekottarika-āgama presentation has none of these meditative attainments
and instead just speaks of being accomplished in concentration, [34] the Madhyama-āgama discourse and the individual translation similarly take up the four jhānas and the
four immaterial spheres. [35] The Madhyama-āgama account also agrees with the Majjhima-nikāya version that the worthy man avoids praising himself and disparaging others
because he is inspired by a saying by the Buddha according to which conceivings are a
manifestation of craving. [36]
The Sappurisa-sutta concludes its exposition by taking up the attainment of cessation,
indicating through its mode of presentation that this attainment is outside of the range
of the unworthy man. [37] The three parallel versions do not mention the attainment of
cessation at all. Instead, they conclude with the Buddha telling the monks that they
should train in accordance with what he had just taught them, so that they will become
worthy men. [38]


[[MN114]] Sevitabbāsevitabba-sutta

The Sevitabbāsevitabba-sutta, the “discourse on what should be followed and what
should not be followed”, offers a detailed analysis of wholesome and unwholesome
conduct. The Sevitabbāsevitabba-sutta as a whole does not have a counterpart in the
Chinese Āgamas. A considerable part of the exposition given in the Sevitabbāsevitabba-sutta recurs, however, in two discourses in the A�guttara-nikāya, one of which has
a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama. [39]
The Sevitabbāsevitabba-sutta proceeds from a brief statement by the Buddha to a detailed exposition by Sāriputta, which the Buddha then recapitulates. The Sevitabbāsevitabba-sutta applies this pattern to three related topics, each of which distinguishes


with the respective concentrative attainment, due to the thought “I am [the] one who has attained” it. In
contrast “the arahant is called atammayo in the sense that he does not identify himself with anything”,
he is no longer ‘made of that’; on atammayatā cf. also Sferra 2011. The statement on conceiving (yena
yena hi maññanti, etc.) recurs in [[UD3.10]] at [[UD32.30]] [[SNP3.8]] at [[SNP588]] and [[SN22.4]] at [[SNP757]] In these
three instances, this phrase seems to stand for the worldling’s mistaken ideas about the nature of reality,
in particular in [[UD3.10]] and [[SNP757]] for the delusion of a self, while in [[SNP588]] the topic is the closely
related illusion of permanency.
34 [[EA17.9]] at T II 585b17 only mentions being “accomplished in concentration”, .
35 Instead of speaking of the attainment of “nothingness”, T 48 at T I 838c19 refers to the attainment of “impermanence”,, which based on the context I take to be an error for the third immaterial attainment.
36 [[MA85]] at T I 562a2: “the Blessed One has explained in many ways that, if there are conceivings, this is
reckoned to be [a form] of craving”, .
37 [[MN113]] at MN III 45,2. Cf. also above p. 367.
38 [[MA85]] at T I 562a14, [[EA17.9]] at T II 585c2, and T 48 at T I 838c28.
39 The partial Pāli parallels are [[AN9.6]] at AN IV 365-369 and a part of [[AN10.54]] found at AN V 100,9102,19. This section of [[AN10.54]] has a counterpart in a section of [[MA109]] found at T I 598c4-19. The
parts in [[AN10.54]] at AN V 98,19 and [[MA109]] at T I 598b9 that are parallels to the present exposition
are preceded by examinations of a different topic, namely the need for a monk to develop tranquillity 三昧成就
and insight.

644   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


between what should be followed and what should not be followed. These three treatments take up:

      - conduct (the three types), inclination of the mind, perceptions, views, and selfhood,

      - the objects of the six senses,

      - requisites and dwelling places of a monk.
The third of these three also forms the topic of the two A�guttara-nikāya discourses
and the Madhyama-āgama version. While in the Sevitabbāsevitabba-sutta the theme is
broached by the Buddha and then elaborated by Sāriputta, in one of the A�guttara-nikāya discourses summary and exposition are spoken by Sāriputta, [40] while in the other
A�guttara-nikāya discourse and its Madhyama-āgama parallel both summary and exposition are by the Buddha. [41]

MN III 58  The Sevitabbāsevitabba-sutta, the two A�guttara-nikāya discourses, and the Madhyama-āgama version agree that what leads to an increase in unwholesome states and a
decrease in wholesome states should not be followed or made use of. In contrast, what
leads to an increase in wholesome states and to a decrease in unwholesome states should
be followed or adopted.
The four versions apply this recommendation to:

      - robes,

      - alms food,

      - resting places,

      - a village,

      - a township,

      - a person. [42]
One of the two A�guttara-nikāya versions explores the case of the person with additional detail, taking into account also whether by living in dependence on a person
requisites are easy or difficult to obtain and if one’s meditation practice improves or
deteriorates, [43] a presentation similar to the examination of the advantages and disadvantages of living in dependence on a person given in the Vanapatha-sutta and in its
two Madhyama-āgama parallels. [44]

42 [[MN114]] at MN III 59,24 applies the same also to a fortified city, nagara, in addition to the village, gama/
, and the township, nigama/, mentioned in all versions. Besides the nagara, [[MN114]] at MN III
59,26, [[AN9.6]] at AN IV 369,6, and [[AN10.54]] at AN V 102,6 also take into account the district, janapada, which is also not mentioned in [[MA109]]

does not improve, one should leave, even if requisites are plenty. If one’s practice improves, one should
remain, even if requisites are difficult to obtain; if in addition requisites are easy to obtain, one should
remain for one’s whole life.

[[MN115]] Bahudhātuka-sutta

The Bahudhātuka-sutta, the “discourse on many elements”, examines various sets of
elements, the sense-spheres, dependent arising (pa�icca samuppāda), and what is possible or impossible. [45] This discourse has two Chinese parallels, one of which is found in
the Madhyama-āgama, while the other is an individual translation. [46] In addition to these
two Chinese parallels, the Bahudhātuka-sutta also has a parallel in a Tibetan discourse, [47]
and in a discourse quotation in Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya, extant in Tibetan. [48] The same discourse recurs, moreover, as a discourse quotation in the Dharmaskandha of the Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma collection. [49]
The Bahudhātuka-sutta begins with the Buddha explaining to his monk disciples that
fears and troubles arise due to a fool, not due to a wise person. The Chinese and Tibetan parallels attribute this thought instead to Ānanda, who had this reflection while
being alone in seclusion. According to the parallels versions, Ānanda then approached
the Buddha to report what he had been thinking about.

45 The last of these four topics, the exposition of impossibilities, recurs in [[AN1.81]] at AN I 26-30.
46 The Chinese parallels are [[MA181]] at T I 723a-724c and T 776 at T XVII 712b-714a, both of which
agree with [[MN115]] on locating the discourse in Jeta’s Grove by Sāvatthī. [[MA181]] also agrees with [[MN115]] on the title ( ), while T 776 has the title “discourse spoken by the Buddha with a Dharma instruction in four parts”,, a title reconstructed by Nanjio 1883/1989: 219 as *Buddhabhā�ita-caturvarga-dharmaparyāya-sūtra. Apart from being found in the title, the expression “four
parts”,, recurs in T 776 at T XVII 712c7, where it stands for the four topics taught, namely the elements, the sense-spheres, dependent arising, and what is possible or impossible. According to the information given in the Taishō edition, T 776 was translated by Făxián ( ). For remarks on [[MA181]] cf.
Minh Chau 1964/1991: 26, 65, and 115-117. A quotation from the present discourse in the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-(upadeśa-)śāstra, T 1509 at T XXV 237a16, gives the discourse’s title as “many elements”,
(Hirakawa 1997: 475 lists dhātu as one of the equivalents to ). For a reference to a version of
the present discourse in Vyākhyāyukti literature cf. Skilling 2000b: 342.
47 The Tibetan parallel is the 多界經 khams mang po pa’i mdo, D (297) mdo sde, sha 297a2-301b2 or Q (963) lu
325b2-330b1, which agrees with [[MN115]] on the location of the discourse and also takes the 佛說四品法門經 “many elements” as its title, although when quoting the Indic original it has these two words in the reverse sequence, cf. D (297) 四品 mdo sde, sha 297a2 or Q (963) lu 325b3: rgya gar skad du dhā tu ba hu ta ka sū tra
(I am indebted to Peter Skilling for kindly allowing me to consult his unpublished translation and edition of the Tibetan discourse and the quote in Abhidh-k-� for my present study). Skilling 1994b: 772 法賢
notes several editions whose title corresponds to the sequence found in the Pāli title and suggests that
“dhātubahutaka must be a reconstruction”. Ibid. p. 774 points out that most colophons do not record the
多性 translator of this discourse, while the Phu brag manuscript of the Kanjur lists *Surendrabodhi and Ye 性
shes sde, translators active during the early 9 [th] century. Skilling (unpubl.) also notes the following partial quotations, which due to their shortness have not found a place in my present study: D (4092)
mngon pa, gu 50b4 or Q (5593) cu 58b7 and D (4069) sems tsam, si 273b1 or Q (5570) i 157a8.
48 Abhidh-k-� at D (4094) mngon pa, ju 28b2-33b4 or Q (5595) tu 31b1-36b6, which gives the title as khams
mang po pa’i mdo, “the discourse on many elements”; cf. also Abhidh-k 1:28 in Pradhan 1967: 18,7,
paralleling [[MN115]] at MN III 62,10, with its Chinese counterparts in T 1558 at T XXIX 6c2 and in T
1559 at T XXIX 166c24. For the full quote cf. below note 61; for further discourse quotations in Abhidh-k-�
cf. below notes 69, 71, 76.
49 This discourse quotation comes at the outset of chapter 20 in T 1537 at T XXVI 501b25-502c18 and is in
several respects close to the Tibetan version.



MN III 61


646   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


In the Pāli version, the Buddha compared the danger caused by a fool to a fire, which
might start from a grass and twig hut but eventually can burn down a whole house. [50]
The same image recurs with minor variations in the other versions. [51] The Chinese and
Tibetan versions additionally highlight that fear due to a fool arises not only at present,
but also in the past and in the future. [52]

MN III 62  According to all versions, Ānanda inquired how to become a wise person. [53] The Buddha
replied by listing knowledge of:

      - the elements

      - the sense-spheres,

      - dependent arising (pa�icca samuppāda),

      - what is possible and what is impossible.
A difference in this respect can be found in the discourse quotation in Śamathadeva’s
commentary and in the Dharmaskandha, which include knowledge of the five aggregates in their definition of what makes the difference between a fool and a wise person
(see table 12.3). [54] The Dharmaskandha also gives a full exposition to this topic. [55]
This reference to the five aggregates causes their overall presentation to become fivefold, which does not fit their own qualification of the discourse as being a fourfold
presentation, literally “four turnings”, a qualification made in all versions. [56] This makes


50 [[MN115]] at MN III 61,13; an image that occurs again in order to illustrate the same predicament in [[AN5.1]] at AN I 101,9.
51 [[MA181]] at T I 723a22 and the Dharmaskandha, T 1537 at T XXVI 501c2, are similar to the Pāli version. The Tibetan discourse at D (297) mdo sde, sha 297b2 or Q (963) lu 326a3 describes how fire may
burn down a house made of dry reeds or a house thatched with dry grass, or a heap of dry straw, thereby
not mentioning that such a fire can affect a bigger building. The same is the case for the discourse quotation in the Abhidh-k-�, D (4094) mngon pa, ju 29a1 or Q (5595) tu 32a1. T 776 at T XVII 712b26 only
describes how a man piles up reed and makes a fire, without mentioning a house affected by this fire at
all.
52 [[MA181]] at T I 723a25, T 776 at T XVII 712b28, D (297) mdo sde, sha 297b4 or Q (963) lu 326a5, and T
1537 at T XXVI 501c4. A difference is that [[MA181]] throughout distinguishes between “foolishness”,
, and “wisdom”,, while the other versions contrast a fool with a wise one.
53 [[MN115]] at MN III 62,2 stands alone in qualifying the wise person to be a monk and an “inquirer”, vīma�saka (a qualification not found in the preceding injunction by the Buddha in S [e] -MN III 166,20). In
[[MA181]] at T I 723b8, T 776 at T XVII 712c5, D (297) mdo sde, sha 298a3 or Q (963) lu 326b4, and D
(4094) mngon pa, ju 29b1 or Q (5595) tu 32b1 Ānanda also asks for a definition of a fool, which the
Buddha explains to be one who does not have knowledge of the elements, of the sense-spheres, of dependent arising, and of what is possible and impossible. [[MA181]] at T I 723b7 precedes its treatment of
foolishness by reporting that Ānanda was so affected by what the Buddha had said that he was in tears,
.
54 D (4094) mngon pa, ju 29b1 or Q (5595) tu 32b1 lists the aggregates first, whereas in T 1537 at T XXVI
愚癡 501c11 they occur in the third place. 智慧
55 T 1537 at T XXVI 502a13. This exposition is without a counterpart in the discourse quotation in Abhidh-k-�, which thus appears to present an intermediate stage, where a reference to the five aggregates has
already become part of the definition of a wise or a fool, but this reference has not yet led to a full exposition, such as found in the Dharmaskandha.
56 D (4094) mngon pa, ju 33b3 or Q (5595) tu 36b5: le’u bzhi pa and T 1537 at T XXIV 502c17:,

it probable that the reference to the five aggregates, which, moreover, occurs in the two
versions at different places, is a later addition.

The Bahudhātuka-sutta and its parallels agree in expounding knowledge of the elements by listing:

 - the eighteen elements related to the senses,

 - the six elements of earth, water, fire, etc.,

 - the six elements related to pleasure and pain, etc., [57]

 - the six elements related to sensual desire and ill will, etc.,

 - the three elements of what belongs to the sensual, to form, and to formlessness,

 - the two elements of what is conditioned and unconditioned. [58]


similar to the fourfold pattern mentioned in the other versions, cf. [[MN115]] at MN III 67,30: catupariva��o, [[MA181]] at T I 724c2:, T 776 at T XVII 713c27:, and D (297) mdo sde, sha 301a7 or
Q (963) lu 330a8: le’u bzhi pa. Abhidh-k-�, however, has also an alternative title that would reflect a
five-fold presentation, as it speaks of the “five[-fold] deathless”, D (4094) mngon pa, ju 33b3 or Q
(5595) tu 36b5: bdud rtsi lnga.
57 While T 776 has the same sequence as [[MN115]] the six elements related to sensual desire and ill will
precede the six elements related to pleasure and pain in [[MA181]] in the Tibetan versions, and in the
Dharmaskandha, cf. table 12.4.
58 In the Pāli discourses, the eighteen elements can be found, e.g., in [[SN14.1]] at SN II 140,11 and [[SN41.2]]
at SN IV 285,3, where they represent the “diversity of elements”, dhātunānatta. The six elements of
earth, etc., occur repeatedly, e.g., in the Majjhima-nikāya in [[MN112]] at MN III 31,15, and [[MN140]] at
MN III 240,18. The six elements related to sensual desire and ill will are listed in [[DN33]] at DN III 四品 四品法門
215,15 and in [[AN6.111]] at AN III 447,15, with a more detailed treatment provided in [[SN14.12]] at SN II
151,16. The triplet sense, form, formless can be found in [[DN33]] at DN III 215,19. The doublet conditioned/unconditioned occurs in [[DN34]] at DN III 274,14. Five of the six elements related to pleasure and
pain recur under the heading of “five faculties”, e.g., in [[DN33]] at DN III 239,12, [[SN36.22]] at SN IV
232,4, and [[SN48.31-40]] at SN V 207-216, expositions which, however, do not include the sixth element
mentioned in [[MN115]] at MN III 62,31, the “element of ignorance”, avijjādhātu. The elements listed in
[[MN115]] recur also in the Vibha�ga, where the eighteen elements can be found at Vibh 87-90, the three


648   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


The Chinese and Tibetan discourses and the Dharmaskandha also mention:

      - four elements, namely the four mental aggregates,

      - three elements, which cover what is inferior, middle, and superior,

      - three elements, namely what is wholesome, unwholesome, and indeterminate,

      - three elements, which comprise the disciple in higher training (sekha), the one
beyond training (asekha), and the one who is neither,

      - two elements, namely what is with influxes and what is free from the influxes. [59]
The Madhyama-āgama and Tibetan discourses and the Dharmaskandha also take up:

      - the three elements of form, formlessness, and cessation,

      - the three elements of past, present, and future times. [60]
These differences result in different numbers of elements being taken into account in
the respective listings (see below table 12.4):

      - the Majjhima-nikāya discourse lists forty-one elements,

      - the individual translation takes up fifty-six elements,

      - the other versions cover sixty-two elements. [61]

MN III 63  The Bahudhātuka-sutta and its Chinese and Tibetan parallels examine the next two
major topics, the six senses-spheres and the twelve links of dependent arising, in similar ways.


sets of six elements at Vibh 82-87, the triplet sense, form, and formless at Vibh 409-420, and the conditioned as against the unconditioned element at Vibh 421,31.
59 A difference in regard to the exposition of the elements is that, according to [[MN115]] at MN III 62,19+
26+33 and MN III 63,4+10, after each set of elements Ānanda inquires if there is still another way to be
skilled or knowledgeable in the elements, siyā pana, bhante, añño pi pariyāyo? The parallel versions do
not record any intervention by Ānanda, so that their exposition of the elements comes as one continuous
explanation by the Buddha.
60 The additional elements covered in the Chinese and Tibetan versions can also be found in other Pāli discourses. The four elements occur in an analysis of deeper levels of concentration into its constituent elements under the heading of the four mental aggregates given in [[MN64]] at MN I 436,21+29, which enjoins to develop insight in regard to “whatever there is of feeling, perception, volitional formations, and
consciousness”, yad eva tattha hoti vedanāgata� saññāgata� sa�khāragata� viññā�agata�. The additional element triplets found in the Chinese and Tibetan versions recur in [[DN33]] at DN III 215,20+22,
DN III 216,16, DN III 217,24, and DN III 218,1, which has the triplet form, formless, and cessation as
its entry 3:14; what is inferior, middle, and superior as its entry 3:15; past, future, and present as its entry 3:24; meritorious, demeritorious, and indeterminate formations as its entry 3:35; and the trainee, the
one beyond training, and the one who is neither as its entry 3:36. The first of these triplets, covering form,
formlessness, and cessation, occurs also in its Chinese parallel [[DA9]] at T I 50a28. Finally the distinction
between what is with influxes and what is free from the influxes is applied in [[DN28]] at DN III 112,7 to
supernormal powers (iddhi), in [[MN117]] at MN III 72,6 to the factors of the noble eightfold path, in [[AN2.7]] at AN I 81,1 to happiness, and in [[AN10.133]] at AN V 275,20 to the ten courses of action.
61 A listing of sixty-two elements is explicitly associated with the present discourse in the *Mahāvibhā�ā,
T 1545 at T XXVII 367c4: (cf. also Buddhavarman’s Vibhā�ā translation,
T 1546 at T XXVIII 279b24), and in the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya, Abhidh-k 1:28 in Pradhan 1967: 18,7:

As the last aspect in their examination of what makes the difference between a wise and
a fool, the Bahudhātuka-sutta and its Chinese and Tibetan parallels turn to the topic of
what is possible and what is impossible.
Somewhat similar to the case of the elements, which constitutes the first of the main
themes in the Bahudhātuka-sutta and nearly all of its parallels, in the case of this last
topic of examination, regarding what is possible and what is impossible, substantial
variations between the Pāli, Chinese, and Tibetan versions can again be found (see below table 12.5).

The Pāli version begins this examination by explaining that a person endowed with
view, [62] an expression implying attainment of stream-entry, will be incapable of considering anything as permanent, satisfactory, or a self. [63] These three impossibilities are not
mentioned in the other versions. The parallel versions agree that for a person endowed
with view it is impossible to kill his or her mother or father, to kill an arahant, to maliciously shed the blood of a Tathāgata, to create a schism in the monastic community, or
to follow another teacher. [64] The Tibetan versions and the Dharmaskandha add that a
person endowed with view is also incapable of intentionally killing a living being. [65]


62 [[MN115]] at MN III 64,17: di��hisampanno puggalo, which Ps IV 107,1 explains to be “the noble disciple
who has attained the stream and is endowed with the view of the path”, maggadi��hiyā sampanno sotāpanno ariyasāvako.
63 The exposition of impossibilities in [[MN115]] recurs in [[AN1.81]] at AN I 26-30 and in Vibh 335,35, which
takes up the same topics in the same sequence; cf. also [[AN6.92-95]] at AN III 439,1 for further indications on what is impossible for a person endowed with view, and [[DN19]] at DN II 225,3 on the impossibility that two Buddhas could appear at the same time within a single world system, cf. also below
note 69.
64 While in the listing in [[MN115]] at MN III 65,3 shedding the blood of a Tathāgata precedes schism, the
opposite sequence can be found in [[MA181]] at T I 724a3, T 776 at T XVII 713b27, D (297) mdo sde, sha
300b2 or Q (963) lu 329a8, D (4094) mngon pa, ju 32a5 or Q (5595) tu 35a7, and T 1537 at T XXVI
502b21 (on this type of variation cf. also Silk 2007b: 254-255). According to [[AN10.70]] at AN III 146,23,


652   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


MN III 65  While the Pāli version simply notes that a person endowed with view is incapable of
following another teacher, [66] the Chinese and Tibetan versions take up the same topic
from several perspectives. The individual translation explains that it is impossible for a
person endowed with right view to commit a breach of the precepts and then slander
his teacher and search for another teacher by approaching other recluses or Brahmins. [67]
According to the Madhyama-āgama and the Tibetan discourse, such a person is not
able to give up the training, to rely on omens and divination, or to think that a non-Buddhist recluse or Brahmin could have a true vision of reality. [68]
The parallel versions continue their examination of impossibilities by pointing out
that two Buddhas or two wheel-turning kings cannot arise in the same world. [69]
The Bahudhātuka-sutta next takes up the impossibility that a female could be any of
the following: [70] a Buddha, a wheel-turning king, Sakka, Māra, Brahmā. [71]
Instead of Māra, the individual translation and Śamathadeva’s commentary speak of
being one of the four heavenly kings. [72] Another difference is that the individual translation, the Tibetan versions, and the Dharmaskandha add to the above set the impossibility that a woman could attain the awakening of a Paccekabuddha. [73]


the first five of these actions lead straight to hell, to which [[AN6.87]] at AN III 436,16 adds that the same
five and foolishness as sixth prevent entering the path of assurance even when one hears the Dharma.

68 [[MA181]] at T I 724a6 and D (297) mdo sde, sha 300b4 or Q (963) lu 329b2.
69 The impossibility of two Buddhas arising at the same time recurs also in [[DN19]] at DN II 225,3, together
with its counterparts in [[DA3]] at T I 31a15 and in the Mahāvastu in Basak 1968/2004: 121,18 or in Senart
1897: 199,10. Other occurrences can be found in [[DN28]] at DN III 114,23 and its parallel [[DA18]] at T I
79a7, as well as in [[AN1.81]] at AN I 27,36. The same impossibility also occurs in a discourse quotation
from the present discourse in the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-(upadeśa-)śāstra, T 1509 at T XXV 237a22, cf.
Lamotte 1970a: 1524, as well as in a discourse quotation in Abhidh-k 3:96 in Pradhan 1967: 184,17,
paralleling [[MN115]] at MN III 65,14; cf. also T 1558 at T XXIX 64c9, T 1559 at T XXIX 222b22, and
Abhidh-k-� at D (4094) mngon pa, ju 188b3 or Q (5595) tu 215b2. Vetter 2001: 67 note 32 points out
that “the statement that it is impossible for two Buddhas to arise at the same time ... finds a context only
in DN II 224 (Mahāgovindasutta)”.
70 On the negative attitude towards women that underlies this stipulation of impossibilities cf., e.g., Barnes
1987: 114, Bentor 2008: 126, Gross 1993: 42, and Rajapakse 1992: 72. This inability does not imply,
however, that women are not capable of reaching liberation, as assumed by [[AN2002]] 11.
71 The impossibility for a woman to be a Buddha is also mentioned in T 60 at T I 858a2 and T 397 at T
XIII 14c14. A discourse quotation paralleling the stipulation that it is impossible for a woman to be a
Brahmā can be found in Abhidh-k 2:12 in Pradhan 1967: 46,24, paralleling [[MN115]] at MN III 66,7; cf.
also T 1558 at T XXIX 16c1, T 1559 at T XXIX 175c28, and Abhidh-k-� at D (4094) mngon pa, ju

The Madhyama-āgama discourse, however, does not take up the subject of what is
impossible for a woman at all. [74] Although from the perspective of transmission this absence could be a loss of material, it could very well be that this particular set of impossibilities was not originally part of the present discourse. [75]
The Bahudhātuka-sutta and its parallels also mention that it is not possible for bad
conduct to ripen in pleasant experience or rebirth in heaven, just as it is not possible for
good conduct to ripen in unpleasant experiences or rebirth in hell. [76]
While the Bahudhātuka-sutta’s account of impossibilities ends at this point, the other
versions continue by exploring the following impossibilities:

 - being well established in satipa��hāna without having overcome the hindrances, [77]

 - developing the awakening factors without being well established in satipa��hāna,

 - reaching awakening without having developed the awakening factors. [78]


byang chub mngon du byed pa, and T 1537 at T XXVI 502b17: . The same notion appears
to be found also in later texts of the Theravāda tradition. Cooray 2004: 244 draws attention to the Apadāna tale of Mahāpaduma, B [e] -Ap-[[AN161]] on stanza 95, who made the aspiration to become a Paccekabuddha when being a woman, but realized this aspiration only after being reborn as a male. Cooray concludes that from the perspective of later Theravāda tradition, “women may ... aspire for paccekabodhi,
though they must undergo a change of sex if their aspirations are to be realized”.
74 This has already been noted by Nagata 2002: 282-283.
75 For a more detailed discussion of this possibility cf. Anālayo 2009b; cf. also, e.g., Hae-ju 1999: 129-131,
and Kajiyama 1982: 55-58.
76 In relation to the topic of rebirth, the Tibetan discourse at an earlier point additionally mentions that it is
impossible for a person endowed with view to come to an eighth existence, D (297) 證獨覺菩提 mdo sde, sha 300b5
or Q (963) lu 329b3: srid pa brgyad pa mngon par ’grub par ’gyur ba ’di ni gnas ma yin no, a point made
also in [[MA181]] at T I 724a28:, and in the Dharmaskandha, T 1537 at T XXVI 502b29:
. The same impossibility recurs, e.g., in [[SN12.1]] at [[SNP230]] and as a discourse quotation in Abhidhk 6:34 in Pradhan 1967: 356,10, paralleling [[MN115]] at MN III 64,16; cf. also T 1558 at T XIX 123b13,
T 1559 at T XIX 275b15, and Abhidh-k-� at D (4094) mngon pa, nyu 22a6 or Q (5595) thu 57a5.
77 This stipulation to remove the five hindrances refers to being fully and well established in satipa��hāna,
cf. [[MA181]] at T I 724b13: “a mind properly established in the four satipa��hānas”,, T
776 at T XVII 713c12: “being well able to completely understand the four satipa��hānas”,
, D (297) mdo sde, sha 301a1 or Q (963) lu 329b5: “dwelling with the mind firmly established in
the four satipa��hānas”, dran pa nye bar gzhag pa bzhi dag la sems shin tu nye bar bzhag nas gnas par
’gyur ba (D: phar), D (4094) mngon pa, ju 32b3 or Q (5595) tu 35b4: “a mind well established in the
four satipa��hānas”, dran pa nye bar bzhag pa bzhi rnams la sems legs par gnas shing, 受八有者 and the Dharma 或受  第八有 skandha in T 1537 at T XXVI 502c3: “a mind well settled in the four satipa��hānas”, .
In other words, the stipulation made in these versions refers to the more developed stages of mindfulness practice. That during well-established satipa��hāna practice unwholesome thoughts no longer have
a scope to arise is also mentioned in [[SN22.80]] at SN III 93,20. In contrast, the instructions given in [[MN10]] at MN I 60,11 (or [[DN22]] at DN II 300,10) and their parallel [[MA98]] at T I 584a 心正立四念處者 24 for satipa��hāna
practice in general direct mindfulness to the presence of the five hindrances in the mind. This formula- 善能了解四
念處 tion makes it clear that satipa��hāna contemplation can be undertaken while the hindrances are present.
In fact, [[AN9.64]] at AN IV 458,4 presents satipa��hāna as the tool to overcome the five hindrances, so
that their overcoming could obviously not be a prerequisite for satipa��hāna practice in general.
78 The relation of satipa��hāna to the development of the awakening factors and the need to develop the
awakening factors for reaching awakening are common themes in other Pāli discourses, cf., e.g., [[DN16]] 心善安住四念住



MN III 66


654   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


The Bahudhātuka-sutta and its parallels conclude with the Buddha giving various
names to the present discourse, such as “four turnings”, “mirror of the Dharma”, “drum
of the deathless”, and also the name used as the title in the Majjhima-nikāya, Madhyama-āgama, and Tibetan versions, the discourse on “many elements”. [79]


[[MN116]] Isigili-sutta

The Isigili-sutta, the “discourse on mount Isigili”, introduces mount Isigili as a former dwelling place of Paccekabuddhas, followed by listing the names and qualities of
various Paccekabuddhas. [80] This discourse has a parallel in the Ekottarika-āgama. [81]


at DN II 83,18, [[DN28]] at DN III 101,10, and [[SN47.12]] at SN V 160,27, or the more detailed treatments
in [[MN118]] at MN III 85,7 and [[SN54.13]] at SN V 331,6. [[MA181]] at T I 724b23 adds one further step by
indicating that, without attaining supreme and complete awakening, it will not be possible to go beyond
dukkha, . As full awakening equals the eradication of dukkha,
this additional proposal seems to some degree redundant.
79 [[MN115]] at MN III 67,30 lists bahudhātuko ... catupariva��o ... dhammādāso ... amatadundubhī ti, with
counterparts in T 776 at T XVII 713c27: ... ... ..., in D (297) mdo sde, sha
301a7 or Q (963) lu 330a8: le’u bzhi pa ... chos kyi me long ... bdud rtsi’i rnga bo che (thereby qualifying the drum of the deathless as “great”) ... khams mang po, in T 1537 at T XXVI 502c17: ...
(qualifying the mirror of the Dharma as “great”) ... ..., and in D (4094) mngon pa, ju
33b3 or Q (5595) tu 36b5: le’u bzhi pa ... chos kyi me long ... bdud rtsi lnga (speaking of a “five[-fold]
deathless” instead of the “drum of the deathless”) ... khams mang po. In addition to these, [[MN115]] at
MN III 67,32 also mentions the “unsurpassable victory in battle”, anuttaro sa�gāmavijayo, an expression not found in the parallel versions. The same title recurs in a listing of five alternative titles for the 不得無上正盡覺, 盡苦邊者, 終無是處
Brahmajāla-sutta, [[DN1]] at DN I 46,24, where it is also absent from the Chinese and Tibetan counterparts, cf. [[DA21]] at T I 94a13, T 21 at T I 270c20, and Weller 1934: 64. [[MA181]] at T I 724c1 also has additional titles for the present discourse, namely the 四品法門 “Dharma element 法鏡 甘露鼓 ”, 多界, the “deathless element”,
, the “many drums”,, and the “Dharma drum”, .
80 Concerning the term paccekabuddha, Norman 1983b: 97 suggests that pacceka might be a wrong back- 四轉 大
formation from 法鏡 pratyaya, so that the implication of the term 甘露鼓 paccekabuddha 多界 would be “one awakened
by an (external) cause” (ibid. p. 99), in the sense of needing an external stimulus through some event or
special circumstance in order to awaken; cf. also von Hinüber 1985/2001: 193. This would distinguish a
Paccekabuddha from a disciple on the one hand, who awakens after receiving teachings, and from a
Buddha on the other hand, who awakens without an external stimulus. The traditional derivation of pacceka from pratyeka (e.g., B [e] -Ps-p� I 115: pacceka� saccāni buddhavanto ti paccekabuddhā) rather gives
the sense of a “single” or “individual” Buddha, a sense in fact found in the present discourse itself, cf.
[[MN116]] at MN III 69,25: paccekam ev’ ajjhagamu� subodhi� (B [e] -MN III 114, 法界 12: ajjhagama�). This
甘露界 sense recurs also in the similar 多鼓 term paccekabrahmā found, 法鼓 e.g., in [[SN6.6]] at SN I 146,24 (or SN [2] 177 at
SN [2] I 318,16) and in [[AN10.89]] at AN V 171,3 (cf. also the corresponding pratyekabrahmā in the Karmavibha�ga in Kudo 2004: 44,1 and 45,1, or in Lévi 1932a: 34,8), since a Brahmā may indeed be solitary
in the sense of being without a retinue, but it would be difficult to relate his status to an external cause
or condition. The same sense can also be seen in the expression paccekagātha in [[DN20]] at DN II 253,16
and [[SN1.37]] at SN I 26,14 (or SN [2] 37 at SN [2] I 55,15), which refers to stanzas spoken by devas “individually”, in the sense of being spoken by “each” of them, an usage also found in the Sa�ghabhedavastu in
Gnoli 1977: 121,9 (although in a different context): pratyekapratyeka� gāthābhir abhi��uyāma, where
the Chinese counterpart, T 1450 at T XXIV 125a2, reads “each”,, and the Tibetan counterpart in

The Isigili-sutta and its parallel explain that, while four of the five mountains that
surround Rājagaha had different names in ancient times, the fifth mountain was called
Isigili already in former times. [82] The Majjhima-nikāya version continues by giving a
popular etymology for the name Isigili, an etymology not recorded in its Ekottarikaāgama parallel. [83]
Both versions list the names of several Paccekabuddhas that used to live on Mount
Isigili. [84] The Ekottarika-āgama discourse continues by relating that, before the Buddha


Waldschmidt 1957a: 75,11 reads “each one”, re res. Cooray 2004: 250 note 1 sums up that in its usage
in the Pāli discourses pacceka conveys “the idea of separation”; cf. also Anālayo 2010h. Wright 2001:
14 comments, regarding the suggestion by Norman that pacceka should rather convey the sense of an
external cause, that “the evidence, however, points rather strongly in the opposite direction”.
81 The parallel is [[EA38.7]] at T II 723a-c, which agrees with [[MN116]] on locating the discourse at Rājagaha.
For a translation of [[EA38.7]] together with extracts from the present study, cf. Anālayo 2010h.
82 The same Mount Isigili was the location where, according to [[SN35.31]] at SN I 121,19 (or [[SN2]] 159 at [[SN2]]
I 266,16) and [[SN22.87]] at SN III 123,9, the monks Godhika and Vakkali committed suicide (on Vakkali
cf. also Anālayo 2011i), and where according to Jā 522 at Jā V 125,23 Mahāmoggallāna was murdered.
83 [[MN116]] at MN III 68,27, according to which on seeing Paccekabuddhas enter the mountain and then
disappear (perhaps by entering a cave?) the locals came to the conclusion that the mountain “swallows
up”, gilati, those “seers”, isī, hence the mountain was called Isigili. Caillat 1968: 178 points out that the
Pāli etymology gilati would be of a later origin, when ºgili was no longer understood to be equivalent to
giri. In fact, [[EA38.7]] at T II 723a15 introduces this mountain as “seer’s cave mountain”,
(adopting the, and variant reading instead of ), and then continues to refer to this mountain as, corresponding to isigiri. Lüders 1954: 45 notes that the Mahābhārata 2:799 does indeed
refer to one of the mountains surrounding Rājagaha as ��igiri; cf. also Bapat 1970: 220 note 28 and Law
1938/1991: 3 and 10.
84 In addition to Paccekabuddhas, according to [[EA38.7]] at T II 723a18 Mount Isigili was also inhabited by
bodhisattvas, arahants, and seers. Of the various Paccekabuddhas mentioned in [[MN116]] Ari��ha (
) recurs in B [e] -Nett 143 and Upari��ha ( ) in Th 910. Tagarasikhin occurs in [[SN22.11]] at SN I
92,4 (or SN [2] 131 at SN [2] I 206,13, with a counterpart in [[SA1233]] at T II 337c8), in [[UD5.3]] at [[UD50.16]]
and in Jā 390 at Jā III 299,26 (according to Rhys Davids 1903/1997: 31, Tagara might refer to a location, in which case his name would be “Sikhin from Tagara”). A reference to Sudassana ( 仙人窟山 ) can be
found in Therāpadāna 宋, 元 514:1 at Ap II 451, 明 4 窟 ; cf. also the similarly named Paccekabuddha 掘 in [[EA38.9]] at T II 724a 仙人山 12. The specification in [[MN116]] at MN III 68,26 that “five hundred Paccekabuddhas
lived for a long time on this mount Isigili”, pañca paccekabuddhasatāni imasmi� isigilismi� pabbate
ciranivāsino ahesu�, is noteworthy, as according to Vism 234,12 a Paccekabuddha lives a solitary life
style, ekacariyanivāsena, and Pj II 64,7 explains that a Paccekabuddha is solitary in several senses, one
of them being that he stands, goes, sits, and lies alone, that is, he is without a companion, adutiya��hena 阿
利吒 eko. The Mahāvastu in Basak 1968/2004: 207, 婆利吒 21 or in Senart 1897: 347,18, however, describes a Pratyekabuddha who had various other Pratyekabuddhas as his attendants, tena dāni pratyekabuddhena ye
paricāritā pratyekabuddhā, and the Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1978a: 15,6 reports how a group of five
hundred Pratyekabuddhas went to beg alms together. In a similar vein, [[EA38.7]] at T II 723b 善觀 6 (cf. note
86 below) reports the self-incineration of five hundred Paccekabuddhas on Mount Isigili, which reads as 善目
if they were living together at the same time and in the same location. Another discourse in the same
collection, [[EA32.5]] at T II 676c18, indicates that Paccekabuddhas have no disciples and live alone, without followers, as they do not teach the Dharma to others, (cf. also
Fujita 1975: 127 note 84). Ruegg 2004: 56 explains that “in Buddhist tradition continued by both the
Prajñāpāramitā and the Abhidharma, the category of Pratyekabuddha is subdivided into two”, distin無弟子, 獨逝無伴侶, 不與他說法

was born, devas living in the Pure Abodes had come to announce to the Paccekabuddhas who were dwelling on Mount Isigili that the Bodhisattva Gotama was about to
take birth. [85] On hearing that a being destined to become a Buddha was going to be born,
the Paccekabuddhas rose up into empty space and incinerated themselves. [86] The Ekottarika-āgama discourse explains that the Paccekabuddhas had undertaken this act of
self-cremation because they knew that there could be only one Buddha at a time in the
world. [87]
The Ekottarika-āgama version continues by describing how a former king became a
Paccekabuddha. After reflecting on the suffering in the hell realms, animal realms, and
among hungry ghosts, this king had become worried about the possibility of being reborn in such conditions. Stirred by this dire prospect, he decided to renounce the throne
and go forth.
Having gone forth on his own, he went to dwell in a secluded place and undertook
contemplation of the arising and passing away of the five aggregates, by dint of which
he eventually became a Paccekabuddha. [88]

the Mahāvastu, cf. Basak 1963a: 467,1 or Senart 1882a: 357,3 (cf. also Basak 1963a: 237,11 or Senart
1882a: 197,1 and Bu ston’s “History of Buddhism” in Obermiller 1932/1986: 7) where this event forms
the background narration for the Mahāvastu version of the stanzas on living a solitary life like a rhinoceros, paralleling the Khaggavisā�a-sutta of the Sutta-nipāta, [[SNP1.3]] at [[SNP35-75]] with a Gāndhārī fragment counterpart in Salomon 2000: 105-112 (for a background narration to [[SNP35-75]] cf. Pj II 46,14, another commentary can be found in T 1650 at T XXXII 473a-480c). Wilson 2003: 41 comments that “these
solitary Buddhas committed their bodies to the flames in what may be seen through the lenses of VedicHindu mortuary rites as a sacrificial act of passing the torch to their successor”. A self-incineration of
Pratyekabuddhas is also described in the Sa�ghabhedavastu, Gnoli 1977: 92,16, where it forms the background narration to a gift of robes 諸辟支佛即於空中燒身取般涅槃 to the bodhisattva who had just gone forth. For a description of a Bhārhut relief that could be depicting such self-incineration cf. Lüders 1941/1966: 44.

that two Sammāsambuddhas cannot coexist, which would not necessarily exclude the possibility of the
coexistence of a Sammāsambuddha and a Paccekabuddha.While the Tibetan parallel to [[MN115]] similarly speaks of the impossibility of the existence of two completely awakened Buddhas at the same time,

parallel to [[MN115]] T 776 at T XVII 713b18, speaks just of the impossibility of the coexistence of two

The Ekottarika-āgama account concludes with the Buddha encouraging the monks to
hold Mount Isigili in high regard, as even at the time of Maitreya Buddha this mountain
will still have the same name. [89]
Instead of this tale, the Majjhima-nikāya version describes the qualities of several
Paccekabuddhas in a set of stanzas. [90] Thus, whereas the Ekottarika-āgama version is
predominantly narrative, the Majjhima-nikāya version is a discourse with little doctrinal or narrative content. Its listing of the names and qualities of Paccekabuddhas is
still in use nowadays as a protective chant, a paritta. [91]


[[MN117]] Mahācattārīsaka-sutta

The Mahācattārīsaka-sutta, the “discourse on the great forty”, examines the noble
eightfold path from the perspective of its eighth and final factor, right concentration.
This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama. [92] Another parallel can be found
in a discourse quotation in Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya,
extant in Tibetan. [93] A few lines of this discourse have also been preserved in Sanskrit
fragments. [94]


89 [[EA38.7]] at T II 723b29.
90 [[MN116]] at MN III 69-71; cf. also Franke 1912: 211. Winternitz 1920/1968: 37 considers this listing in
[[MN116]] of names in prose and then in verse to be a sign of lateness, as this type of pattern recurs more
frequently in later Buddhist Sanskrit literature; cf. also Barua 1971/2003: 530. Skilling 1996a: 182 note
112 points out that these stanzas end with an injunction to pay homage to the Paccekabuddhas, [[MN116]]
at MN III 71,3: paccekabuddhā ... vandatha. Wiltshire 1990: 7 comments that this listing “would seem
to imply that paccekabuddhas held or were intended to hold some special significance for those to whom
the Buddha’s discourse was addressed. It therefore indicates that some form of ‘cultus’ must have existed
in respect of them”.
91 Kloppenborg 1983: 42 explains that “images of Paccekabuddhas were used for the purpose of protection. This could well be the outcome of their reputation for extended practice of mettā, popularly believed to be a protective power which counteracts inimical influences”, a protective power she then suggests to also stand behind the use of the Isigili-sutta as a paritta; cf. also Cooray 2004: 246.
92 The parallel is [[MA189]] at T I 735b-736c and has the title “discourse on the noble path”, . As already noted by Skilling 1997a: 341, Abhidh-k-� at D (4094) mngon pa, ju 235b4 or Q (5595) tu 269a5
agrees with [[MN117]] on the title “great forty”, chen po bzhi bcu, cf. also the *Mahāvibhā�ā, T 1545 at T
XXVII 911c1: . While [[MN117]] has Jeta’s Grove by Sāvatthī as its location, [[MA189]]
takes place at Kammāsadhamma in the Kuru country. [[MA189]] has been translated into English in Anālayo 2010i and into German in Meisig 1987a.

MN III 71  The Mahācattārīsaka-sutta and its parallels approach their subject by defining right
concentration as one-pointedness of the mind that is supported by the other seven factors of the noble eightfold path. [95] This definition, unlike the more common definition of
right concentration by way of the four jhānas, [96] highlights the importance of developing concentration as part of a comprehensive practice of the noble eightfold path. [97]
Before coming to this definition of right concentration, the Madhyama-āgama version introduces right concentration as the “single way” for the purification of beings, [98]
thereby making use of a qualification that the Madhyama-āgama parallel to the Satipa��hāna-sutta uses in relation to the four satipa��hānas. [99] The discourse quotation in
Śamathadeva’s commentary has a similar passage, although it speaks of the “single vehicle” for the purification of beings. [100]
The Madhyama-āgama discourse follows its definition of right concentration by describing the conditional dependence of each path factor on the preceding one, a statement found at a later point also in the Pāli and Tibetan versions. [101] At the conclusion of
this conditioned sequence, the Madhyama-āgama and Tibetan versions declare that a
noble disciple, who has acquired right concentration in this way, will soon reach awakening. [102]
The three versions highlight the role of right view as a precursor to the other path
factors, since based on right view and with the support of right effort and right mindfulness the other path factors can be developed. The task of right view is to differentiate between right and wrong manifestations of the first five path factors. Right effort is
the actual endeavour to overcome wrong path factors and to develop their right counterparts, while right mindfulness is the presence of mindfulness required for this task. [103]

version, namely right after the summing up of the exposition into two sets of twenty.

When examining individual path factors, the Majjhima-nikāya version expounds the MN III 72
path factors view, intention, speech, action, and livelihood in a threefold manner, by distinguishing between manifestations of these path factors that are:

 - wrong,

 - right,

 - supramundane.
The presentation of the wrong and right manifestations of these path factors is fairly
similar in the three versions. A noteworthy difference is that the Madhyama-āgama
version does not mention the denial of the existence of spontaneously arisen beings in
its exposition of wrong view, nor does it stipulate belief in their existence when describing right view. [104] Occurrences of similar listings in the Madhyama-āgama, in the
Ekottarika-āgama and in several Chinese Vinayas also do not mention spontaneously
arisen beings. [105] Thus, according to these versions, to believe in the existence of spon

[[MA189]] at T I 735c13 and D (4094) mngon pa, nyu 44b4 or Q (5595) thu 84a5. While [[MN117]] continues in the same way, [[MA189]] differs in as much as its exposition of the relation of right view to each
path factor does not conclude that the distinction between right and wrong factors is an implementation
of right view, but rather of the respective factor itself. Thus in the case of right action, for example, [[MA189]] at T I 736a15 indicates that “when he sees wrong action as wrong action, this is reckoned right action, when he sees right action as right action, that is also reckoned right action”,
. As Meisig 1987a: 238 note 27 points out, this is obviously
a textual error. A comparable error occurs also in Abhidh-k-�, which in the context of describing the
role of effort and mindfulness for abandoning wrong intention and arousing right intention speaks of
‘view’, when ‘intention’ would instead be required, D (4094) mngon pa nyu 45a2 or Q (5595) thu 84b4,
thereby confusing log par rtog pa and yang dag pa’i rtog pa with log par lta ba and yang dag pa’i lta
ba. This error differs from the one found in [[MA189]] as it replaces the path-factor with view, whereas
[[MA189]] replaces view with the path-factor. Nevertheless, the similarity in type of this error shows how
in such a repetitive exposition such confusion can easily arise during the transmission of the texts.

where this listing functions as an instance of wrong view). Spontaneously arisen beings are also not
mentioned in a definition of right view in the Arthaviniścaya-sūtra in Samtani 1971: 35,5. Another relevant instance is [[SA1039]] at T II 271c14, which in what is the counterpart to a reference to spontaneously
arisen beings in [[AN10.176]] at AN V 265,23 has the statement: “there are no living beings born in the
world”,, a formulation that leaves it open to interpretation if it refers to beings being reborn in general or in a ‘spontaneous’ manner. That the point at stake would indeed be spontaneous rebirth can be seen from the Tibetan parallel to the same type of reference, albeit in the positive mode,
found in [[SA784]] at T II 203a7 to, in which case the corresponding passage in Abhidh-k-� at
D (4094) mngon pa, ju 206a5 or Q (5595) tu 235a7 reads sems can rdzus te byung ba yod do. The same
expression in [[MA71]] at T I 525b15, however, appears to rather intend rebirth as such, as becomes clear from its use throughout the discourse, even though the parallel [[DN23]] at DN II 318,18 does

taneously arisen beings would not be required for establishing right view. The Tibetan
counterpart to the Mahācattārīsaka-sutta, however, does mention spontaneously arisen
beings in its presentation of wrong and right view. [106]
Another and rather major difference is that the Madhyama-āgama discourse and the
Tibetan version do not have the supramundane manifestations of the path factors, found
in the Majjhima-nikāya version, at all (see below table 12.6). [107] Notably, the Mahācattārīsaka-sutta is the only discourse in the Pāli Nikāyas that features such a presentation
of the path factors defined as “supramundane”. [108]
According to the preamble found in all versions of the discourse, the main intent of
the present exposition was to show the supportive function of the other seven path factors for right concentration. That is, the point at stake does not seem to have been an
exposition of the path factors individually, but rather their interrelation as a basis for
developing right concentration, and in particular the function of right view, right effort,
and right mindfulness as means of correction and support for the other path factors. [109]
This intent of the exposition would not require a supramundane description of the path
factors. Hence, it seems quite possible that the exposition of the supramundane path
factors is a later expansion of the present discourse. Perhaps an early commentary on
the Mahācattārīsaka-sutta developed such a treatment of the path factors from the supramundane perspective of path attainment. What originally may have been only an alternative mode of explanation preserved in an oral commentary, during the process of
transmission could then have become part of the discourse itself.

refer to spontaneously reborn beings. An explicit reference to the existence of spontaneously arisen beings can be found in a description of wrong view in the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, T 1442 at T XXIII
692c8: . A reference to spontaneously arisen beings occurs also in Abhidh-k 9 in

107 For a more detailed discussion of this difference cf. Anālayo 2005c: 98-100.
108 The importance of this unique supramundane description of the path factors can be seen in a discussion
on the nature of the supramundane noble path, depicted in the commentary on the Vibha�ga at Vibh-[[AN320.26]] according to which a monk should ask another monk if he is a “reciter of the ‘great forty’”, tva�
tāva mahācattā�īsakabhā�ako 無化生有情於此世間 hosi? This question shows the significance of the present discourse, whose
recall the commentaries consider an indispensable requirement for being able to engage in a discussion
on the supramundane noble path. Mori 1990: 125 takes the expression mahācattārīsakabhā�aka to be
an example of “Bhā�akas who further specialized in some particular suttas” (Adikaram 1946/1994: 31
and Goonesekera 1968: 689, in their surveys of the bhā�aka tradition, simply list the mahācattārīsakabhā�aka without attempting an explanation). Alternatively, the expression mahācattārīsakabhā�aka
may also be just a form of inquiring if the other monk remembered the exposition given in this particular discourse, equivalent to asking him: mahācattārīsaka� dhāresi? Be that as it may, the use of the
term mahācattārīsakabhā�aka definitely highlights the importance of the exposition of the noble eightfold path given in [[MN117]] which due to its uniqueness in the Pāli discourses would have been (and still
is) an important reference point for discussions on the supramundane path.

Chapter 12 Anupada-vagga                                    -  661


A somewhat similar exposition of the path factors in their supramundane manifestation can be found in a discourse in the Sa�yukta-āgama, which distinguishes all eight
path factors into worldly and supramundane manifestations. [110] The description of the
first five supramundane path factors in this Sa�yukta-āgama discourse is similar to the
corresponding sections in the Mahācattārīsaka-sutta.
Unlike the Mahācattārīsaka-sutta, however, this Sa�yukta-āgama discourse only
takes up right path factors in their worldly and supramundane manifestations, without
covering wrong manifestations of the path factors. The Sa�yukta-āgama discourse also
does not mention the role of right view, right effort, and right mindfulness in relation to
each path factor. These differences make it clear that this Sa�yukta-āgama discourse
would not be a parallel to the Mahācattārīsaka-sutta.
Nevertheless, the occurrence of an exposition of the supramundane path factors in a
Sa�yukta-āgama discourse shows that different Buddhist traditions gave importance to
this type of presentation. Its occurrence further supports the assumption that this type
of treatment could stem from an early Indian exegetical tradition, which during the
course of transmission could have made its way into the Mahācattārīsaka-sutta in the
case of the Pāli tradition and into the Sa�yukta-āgama discourse in the case of the reciter tradition that transmitted this particular discourse collection.
Another difference between the Mahācattārīsaka-sutta and its parallels is that the
Chinese and Tibetan versions extend their treatment to the path factors right effort,
right mindfulness, and right concentration, with the Madhyama-āgama version also
mentioning right liberation and right knowledge (see table 12.6). [111]
Yet, in all versions right concentration has already been defined as one-pointedness
of the mind endowed with the other seven path factors, while right effort and right mindfulness have been defined as the effort and the mindfulness required for establishing
the right manifestations of the other path factors. Hence, it seems redundant to treat
these path factors once more.
Moreover, whereas in regard to the earlier path factors the Chinese and Tibetan versions invariably conclude each treatment by highlighting the cooperative action of right
view, right effort, and right mindfulness, the same is absent from their exposition of the
remaining three path factors. Nor do they provide a contrast to wrong manifestations of
these path factors.
The Chinese and Tibetan versions also differ in the definitions they employ. Whereas
the Chinese version uses the standard descriptions of the four right efforts, the four
satipa��hānas, and the four absorptions, the Tibetan version instead defines these three
path factors by listing several synonyms for effort, mindfulness, and concentration in
turn.
This makes it highly probable that the additional treatment of these three path factors
was added during the process of transmission, with the reciter(s) supplying the ‘miss

ing’ parts, perhaps even unintentionally, from the standard treatment of this subject
found elsewhere in the discourses. [112] This impression is further strengthened by the
circumstance that the Madhyama-āgama stands alone in mentioning right liberation
and right knowledge at this point.

MN III 76  The Mahācattārīsaka-sutta and the Tibetan version continue by depicting the conditional dependence of each path factor on the preceding one, a treatment that the Madhyama-āgama version already took up at an earlier point. In all versions, this exposition
is complementary to their earlier depiction of right view, right effort, and right mindfulness as necessary conditions for the implementation of the path factors right speech,
right action, and right livelihood, thereby highlighting the conditional interrelatedness
of the factors of the noble eightfold path.
The Mahācattārīsaka-sutta and its parallels extend their examination to the ten-factored path of an arahant, followed by indicating that each of the ten right factors serves
the purpose of overcoming its wrong counterpart. [113]


112 Cf. also Meisig 1987a: 230. In fact, whereas the earlier part of [[MA189]] at T I 735c3 was concerned with
a definition of “noble right concentration”,, just as its counterpart [[MN117]] at MN III 71,16: ariyo sammāsamādhi, the present part in [[MA189]] at T I 736b16 speaks merely of “right concentration”,
, a change of terminology that supports the impression that this part of the discourse may be a later
expansion or addition. The Tibetan version, however, speaks from the outset only of “right concentration”, without further qualifying it as “noble”, cf. D (4094) mngon pa, nyu 44a2 or Q (5595) thu 83b1:
yang dag pa’i ting nge ’dzin.
113 A description of how the right path factors overcome their wrong counterparts can also be found in [[DN34]] at DN III 291,13 and in [[AN10.106]] at AN V 215,1, cf. also the Daśottara-sūtra fragment 679 folio
23R in Schlingloff 1962a: 12 and its Chinese counterpart [[DA10]] at T I 57b14.

Another difference between the parallel versions can be found in the sequence in
which they present the final two factors, as right knowledge precedes right liberation in
the Pāli version, [114] whereas in the Chinese and Tibetan versions right knowledge follows right liberation.
The Madhyama-āgama version also offers an explanation of right knowledge. According to its presentation, right knowledge stands for the retrospective knowing that
right liberation has been reached by becoming free from lust, anger, and delusion. [115]
The Mahācattārīsaka-sutta and its parallels sum up their exposition by adding up the
ten wholesome factors, the ten wholesome states originating from them, the ten un
114 The sequence found in [[MN117]] at MN III 76,6 appears to be standard in the Pāli discourses, some of
which indicate that right knowledge is the factor that leads to right liberation. This suggests that right
knowledge stands for penetrative insight, for seeing things as they truly are, which then issues in realization, in fact [[DN18]] at DN II 217,10 explicitly indicates that sammāñā�assa sammāvimutti pahoti. Ñā�a similarly precedes vimutti in [[DN17]] at DN II 217,10, [[DN33]] at DN III 271,9, [[DN34]] at DN III 292,2,
[[MN8]] at MN I 44,15, [[MN65]] at MN I 447,2, [[MN78]] at MN II 29,9, [[SN55.26]] at SN V 384,1, [[AN5.118]]
at AN I 292,8, [[AN4.89]] at AN II 89,35, [[AN4.206]] at AN II 222,12, [[AN8.21]] at AN II 223,28, [[AN4.210]]
at AN II 225,15, [[AN10.103-166]] at AN V 212-249, [[AN10.218]] at AN V 310,12, and [[AN11.11]] at AN V
327,15. The Chinese Āgamas usually follow the sequence found in [[MA189]] with right knowledge coming only after right liberation, cf., e.g., [[DA10]] at T I 57b17, [[DA11]] at T I 59a25, [[DA12]] at T I 60a22, [[SA481]] at T II 122c6, and [[SA750]] at T II 198c10. An exception can be found in [[DA9]] at T I 52c8, where right
knowledge precedes right liberation. Yet, [[DA9]] at T I 52c7 also has right mindfulness before right effort, which suggests that the presentation in this discourse may have suffered from a transmission or
translation error. The sequence found in [[MA189]] recurs also in the Sanskrit fragments of the Sa�gītisūtra and the Daśottara-sūtra, cf. fragment K 484m2Rb in Stache-Rosen 1968: 35 and fragment 679
folio 23R4 in Schlingloff 1962a: 12. Notably, the Pāli discourses that refer to right knowledge do not
seem to specify the implications of right knowledge or to offer further explanations on its significance.
The type of knowledge that in the discourses usually precedes liberation is insight into the four noble
truths. Such insight, however, could also be considered as an instance of right view, which the discourses in fact explicitly define as insight into the four noble truths, cf., e.g., [[DN22]] at DN II 312,1. On
sammā ñā�a in the Pāli discourses cf. also Bucknell 1984: 9-10, 15, and 31 and id. 1986: 6-7.
115 [[MA189]] at T I 736b19: “knowing that the mind has been liberated from sensual desire, knowing that
the mind has been liberated from anger and from delusion, this is reckoned right knowledge”,
; for a similar definition cf. also [[SA750]] at T II 198c11. This explanation squares well with the Pāli commentaries, according to which right knowledge represents reviewing knowledge, cf. Ps I 189,1: paccavekkha�āñā�a� sammāñā�an ti vuccati, cf. also Ps IV 134,24,
which glosses the occurrence of sammāñā�a in [[MN117]] with maggapaccavekkha�a and phalapaccavekkha�a. On this commentarial explanation, right knowledge should indeed be placed after right liberation, not before it. Such retrospective knowledge of liberation is part of the standard description of
realization in the Pāli discourses, which invariably speak of knowing that birth has been destroyed, the
holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, etc., cf., e.g., [[DN2]] at DN I 84,10. The
same is also reflected in another type of presentation in the Pāli discourses, where the aggregate of liberation is followed by the aggregate of “knowledge and vision of liberation”, cf., e.g., [[SN22.21]] at SN I 知欲心
100, 解脫, 2 (or SN 知恚癡心解脫, [2] 135 at SN 是謂正智也 [2] I 222,16), [[SN6.2]] at SN I 139,18 (or SN [2] 173 at SN [2] I 304,22), [[SN47.13]] at
SN V 162,20, [[AN5.50]] at AN I 162,7, [[AN10.59]] at AN III 134,15, [[AN5.250]] at AN III 271,12, [[AN10.12]] at
AN V 16,25, and It 4:5 at It 108,3. In the same type of presentation, however, the aggregate of liberation is preceded by the aggregate of wisdom, which would thus mirror the position given in the Pāli
discourse to right knowledge in respect to right liberation.

wholesome factors, and the ten unwholesome states originating for them, thereby arriving at a final count of forty. [116]
The Majjhima-nikāya version proclaims that the Dharma instruction on the great forty
has been set rolling and cannot be stopped from rolling by any recluse or Brahmin, [117]
with the Madhyama-āgama and Tibetan versions referring to this Dharma instruction
on the forty as a divine wheel (literally: Brahmā’s wheel). [118]

MN III 78  The three discourses conclude by proclaiming that anyone who rejects this discourse
will only incur censure, since by doing so one would speak in praise of those endowed
with the wrong manifestations of the ten factors. [119]


[[MN118]] Ānāpānasati-sutta

The Ānāpānasati-sutta, the “discourse on mindfulness of breathing in and out”, offers a detailed exposition of mindfulness of breathing and of its relation to the four satipa��hānas, to the seven factors of awakening, and to knowledge and liberation. This
discourse has a parallel in the Sa�yukta-āgama. [120]


116 A discourse quotation from this section can be found in the *Mahāvibhā�ā, T 1545 at T XXVII 911c1.
117 [[MN117]] at MN III 77,26: mahācattārīsako dhammapariyāyo pavattito appa�ivattiyo sama�ena vā brāhma�ena vā (C [e] -MN III 220,34: mahācattārisako). The use of the verb “rolling” in this context is unusual, as elsewhere the Pāli discourses use this term in relation to rolling the wheel of the Dharma, but
do not speak of “rolling” in relation to a discourse or an instruction, cf. [[DN16]] at DN II 140,25, [[MN111]] at MN III 29,15, [[MN141]] at MN III 248,6, [[SN8.7]] at SN I 191,13 (or SN [2] 215 at SN [2] I 412,4), [[SN56.11]] at SN V 423,16, [[AN1.70]] at AN I 23,10, [[AN5.21]] at AN I 110,26, [[AN10.71]] at AN III 148,10,

lo. The usage of the wheel imagery fits the idea of “rolling”, suggesting that perhaps this image has been
lost in the Pāli version.
119 [[MN117]] and [[MA189]] mention followers of the doctrine of non-action who nevertheless would not dare
to contradict this exposition. [[MN117]] at MN III 78,13 refers to these as Okkalā Vassa-Bhaññā (C [e] -MN
III 222,25 and S [e] -MN III 189,6 read Ukkalā). The commentary at Ps IV 136,4 explains that Vassa and
Bhañña are the proper names of two individuals who were inhabitants of the country of Okkala. The
Ukkalā-Vassa-Bhaññā as proponents of a doctrine of non-action recur in [[SN22.62]] at SN III 73,3 and in
[[AN7.35]] at AN II 31,21; cf. also Kv 141,28. [[MA189]] at T I 736c19 instead speaks of “the squatters and
advocators [of the practice] of squatting”, and a little later refers to being “cut off and destroyed”, . Bareau 1981b: 3 concludes that [[MA189]] 梵輪 “makes no allusion to the Ukkalas”, but
Meisig 1987a: 245 note 93 and 99 suggests that the translator may not have recognized these proper
names and instead rendered them as the activities of “squatting” and being “cut off and destroyed”.
120 The parallel is [[SA815]] at T II 209b-210a and takes place in Jeta’s Grove, while [[MN118]] takes place in
the Hall of Migāra’s Mother in the same Sāvatthī. Akanuma 1929/1990: 77 gives “observance day”,
, as a tentative title for [[SA815]] According to ibid. p. 169, another parallel should be the individual
translation T 96 at T I 919a-b. Apart from a single sentence that relates the practice of mindfulness of
breathing to the acquisition of knowledge and liberation, however, this discourse has nothing in common with [[MN118]] Zürcher 1995: 166 note 8 comments that T 96 “appears to be an independent treatise ... not based upon the prototype of the Pali 蹲踞說蹲踞 ānāpāna-sati-sutta”. For a Sanskrit fragment with instructions on mindfulness of breathing cf. below note 140. 斷絕破壞

The Ānāpānasati-sutta and its Sa�yukta-āgama counterpart begin with an introductory narration, according to which senior monks were instructing junior monks in various ways. [121] According to the Majjhima-nikāya account, the Buddha expressed his appreciation of the serious practice of the monks by stating that they were worthy of respect and offerings. The Sa�yukta-āgama version reports him expressing his appreciation by declaring that the monk disciples of former and future Buddhas had practised
and will practise in the same way. [122]
The two versions differ to some degree in their description of the distinctions attained and the practices undertaken by the members of the assembled community of
monks (see table 12.7). They agree that each of the four stages of awakening had been
reached by some of the monk disciples present on this occasion. The Sa�yukta-āgama
discourse indicates that some of the monks had also attained:

 - the jhānas,

 - the immaterial attainments,

 - the supernormal knowledges (abhiññā).
In addition to listing their attainments, the Ānāpānasati-sutta and its parallel also describe the meditation practices undertaken by some of the monks, who were engaged in
practising:

 - the brahmavihāras, [123]

 - meditation on the impure,

 - perception of impermanence,

 - mindfulness of breathing.
The Sa�yukta-āgama discourse also explains the purpose of these practices, indicating
that the monks undertook contemplation of the impure to counter sensual desire, meditation on loving kindness to counter anger, perception of impermanence to counter conceit, and mindfulness of breathing to counter (distracting) thoughts and perceptions. [124]

121 An introductory narration that is similar in several respects can be found in [[AN8.14]] at AN II 183,16.
According to [[MN118]] at MN III 79,2, Ānanda was among the monks present on this occasion ([[SA815]]
does not list the elders that were present). In [[SN54.13-14]] at SN V 328-334 and [[SA810]] at T II 208a-c,
Ānanda receives the same instruction on mindfulness of breathing on yet another occasion. Since according to [[SN54.13]] and [[SA810]] the instruction was prompted by an inquiry by Ānanda, it should presumably be considered earlier than the exposition in [[MN118]] since if Ānanda had already heard the
exposition given in [[MN118]] he would not have needed to request another exposition of the same matter on a subsequent occasion. In contrast, his mere presence as a member of a group of monks to whom
[[MN118]] was delivered would not conflict with him having personally received the same exposition already on an earlier occasion.
122 [[SA815]] at T II 209c17.
123 While [[MN118]] at MN III 81,30 describes monks undertaking each of the four brahmavihāras, [[SA815]]
at T II 209c29 only mentions their practice of loving kindness. In its earlier description of the attainments of the monks, however, [[SA815]] at T II 209c21 mentions all four brahmavihāras. As this implies
that the monks must have been undertaking the respective brahmavihāra practices, the two versions
seem to agree that some monks were developing each of the four brahmavihāras.
124 A similar correlation of these meditation practices with these mental obstructions can be found in other
Pāli discourses, with the minor difference that, whereas according to [[SA815]] at T II 210a1 mindfulness

According to the Majjhima-nikāya version, some monks were also engaged in practising each of the different sets of mental qualities and practices that make up the
thirty-seven requisites to awakening (bodhipakkhiyā dhammā). None of these is mentioned in the Sa�yukta-āgama version. The way the requisites to awakening are introduced in the Ānāpānasati-sutta appears to be modelled on the description of the different levels of attainments mentioned earlier, even though this mode of description
does not fit a listing of the requisites of awakening too well. [125] This, together with the
absence of this whole passage from the parallel version, suggests the possibility that
the requisites to awakening might not have been part of the original exposition.

MN III 82   The Ānāpānasati-sutta and its parallel take up the practice of mindfulness of breathing in sixteen steps, which they correlate with the four satipa��hānas. [126] A minor but


of breathing “removes thoughts and perceptions”,, [[AN9.1]] at AN IV 353,11 (cf. also [[UD4.1]] at
[[UD37.17]]) does not mention perceptions and only indicates that mindfulness of breathing leads to “cutting of thoughts”, vitakkūpacchedāya (B [e] -AN III 165,14: vitakkupacchedāya, C [e] -AN V 370,18: vitakkapacchedāya).
125 E.g., the description in [[MN118]] at MN III 81,25 that there were monks who practised the noble eightfold path, santi ... bhikkhū imasmi� bhikkhusa�ghe ariyassa a��ha�gikassa maggassa bhāvanānuyogam anuyuttā viharanti, reads almost as if other monks present on this occasion did not develop the
eightfold noble path. Judging from the way the whole company of monks has just been praised, this
would hardly have been the case, giving rather the impression that all of them would have been engaged in developing the noble eightfold path.
126 [[SA815]] at T II 210a2 has abbreviated this whole section, which thus needs to be supplemented with the 斷覺想
full treatment given in [[SA810]] at T II 208a-208c (translated in Anālayo 2007d), a discourse that parallels [[SN54.13]] at SN V 328-333. The initial exposition of the sixteen steps of mindfulness of breathing


Chapter 12 Anupada-vagga                                    -  667


noteworthy difference in relation to the third step of mindfulness of breathing is that
whereas the Majjhima-nikāya instructions speak of experiencing the “whole body”, [127]
its Sa�yukta-āgama counterpart speaks of experiencing “all bodily formations”. [128]
The Majjhima-nikāya instructions for the third step of mindfulness of breathing can
be interpreted in different ways, as they could be taken to refer to the ‘body’ of the
breath, or else to the whole physical body. [129] Since other Pāli and Chinese discourses
identify the breath as a “bodily formation”, [130] the formulation in the Sa�yukta-āgama
presentation fits the interpretation according to which the breath is the exclusive object
of mindfulness at this stage, instead of awareness encompassing the breath together
with the physical body.
In regard to another instance of this instruction in the Mahārāhulovāda-sutta, however, the corresponding Ekottarika-āgama version directs awareness to the “body”, [131]


in [[SA810]] at T II 208a23 is again abbreviated, and thus needs to be supplemented with the full treatment given in [[SA803]] at T II 206a27. Judging from the abbreviation in [[SA815]] however, it seems as if
only the treatment of the sixteen steps found in [[SA803]] should be supplemented, not the relation of
these sixteen steps to the seven awakening factors and to knowledge and liberation given in [[SA810]]
For a comparative study of the sixteen steps in a range of sources cf. Dhammajoti 2008. A discourse
quotation on mindfulness of breathing as a mode of practising the four satipa��hānas can be found in
the *Mahāvibhā�ā, T 1545 at T XXVII 134b18.

other meditation treatises preserved in Chinese, T 602 at T XV 165a12 and T 606 at T XV 216a15,
speak in this context of knowing the “bodily motions”, . The Śrāvakabhūmi, Shukla 1973: 230,3 or
ŚSG 2007: 96,3 and T 1579 at T XXX 432b2, which otherwise agrees closely with the presentation in
[[SA810]] instructs to experience the whole body, sarvakāyapratisa�vedī/, thereby corresponding
to the Pāli instructions for this third step of mindfulness of breathing. The same is also the case for the
corresponding instruction in the Mahāvyutpatti no. 1177 in Sakaki 1926: 89, according to which this
step of practice is concerned with the “body”, sarvakāyapratisa�vedya, and the bodily formations occur only in the next step, prasrabhya kāyasa�skārān. Sanskrit fragments of a meditation treatise that
contains instructions on mindfulness of breathing, the “Yogalehrbuch”, also do not seem to have brought
in formations in their description of this third step of mindfulness of breathing, cf. fragment 118V 一切身行覺知 4:
sarvak[ā](yapratisa�vedanāyām) and fragment 122R5: (sarvakā)yapratisa�(vedanāyām) in Schlingloff 1964: 69 and 75. The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā(-upadeśa)-śāstra 動身, T 1509 at T XXV 138a11, also
follows awareness of long and short breaths with awareness of the whole body, although in its presentation this forms the fourth step of practice. Of interest in relation to this third step of mindfulness of 了遍身
breathing is also the, T 614 at T XV 275b26, which describes how awareness during this
third step of mindfulness of breathing “pervades and reaches inside the body up to the toes and the
fingers, pervading every pore [of the body]”,, “being aware from
the feet to the hair”,, a practice it compares to water entering sand, . A more
detailed discussion of this instruction in the light of modern day meditation practice can be found in
Anālayo 2006a.

668   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


as does a Madhyama-āgama parallel to another instance of this instruction in the Satipa��hāna-sutta. [132] Another Sa�yukta-āgama discourse speaks also just of the “body” in
its instructions for the third step of mindfulness of breathing, thereby agreeing with the
way this instruction is formulated in the Pāli discourses as well as in the Madhyamaāgama and the Ekottarika-āgama. [133]
Thus, the formulation of the third step of mindfulness of breathing in the Sa�yuktaāgama counterpart to the Ānāpānasati-sutta could be the result of a transmission or
translation error, where the reference to bodily formations in the fourth step of the sixteen-fold scheme influenced the formulation of the third step. [134]
Another difference in regard to this first tetrad of mindfulness of breathing is that the
Majjhima-nikāya version uses the injunction “to know” in relation to the first two steps,
after which it enjoins “to train” in relation to the remaining steps. [135] The Sa�yukta-āgama version instead speaks of “training” throughout. [136]
Yet another difference can be found in regard to the final four steps of mindfulness
of breathing. In the Ānāpānasati-sutta, these final four steps proceed from contemplating impermanence to contemplating fading away, cessation, and relinquishment. [137] The
Sa�yukta-āgama version instead follows contemplation of impermanence with contemplating eradication, fading away, and cessation. [138] While the sequence found in the


132 [[MA98]] at T I 582c16: “he trains [to experience] the whole body [when] he breathes in, he trains [to experience] the whole body [when] he breathes out”, .
133 [[SA807]] at T II 207a19 agrees closely with the presentation in [[MN118]] as it proceeds from “experiencing the whole body”,, to “calming the bodily formations”, .
134 This possibility suggests itself from [[SA803]] at T II 206a28, which instructs to “experience and know
the whole body”,, followed by instructing to “experience and know all bodily formations”,
. As [[SA803]] does not refer to the fourth step of calming bodily formations at all, it
seems as if some confusion during transmission or translation has occurred. Thus [[SA807]] could still
preserve the original version, [[SA803]] shows what could be a transitional stage, where the original and
the changed instruction stand side by side, while in [[SA810]] only the altered instruction is found.
135 [[MN118]] at MN III 82,28-32 uses the expression “he knows”, pajānāti, in relation to the first two steps
of being mindful of the breath as long or short, but then uses the expression 學一切身息入, 學一切身息出 “he trains”, sikkhati, from
step three onwards during the remainder of its exposition. The instructions in the Path to Liberation (Vimuttimagga/ 一切身覺 ), T 1648 at T XXXII 429c28, are similar to [[MN118]] 身行休息 Buddhadāsa 1971/1976:
63 explains this change of terminology to imply that “from stage 3 onwards we are concerned with the
real practice, the training 覺知一切身 proper”, whereas “stages 1 and 2 are just preliminaries”. The Arthaviniścaya覺知一切身行 sūtra in Samtani 1971: 43-45 (cf. also T 763 at T XVII 657b29), however, does not use “training” in relation to any of the sixteen steps.
136 [[SA810]] at T II 208a24 enjoins to “train”,, already in relation to the preliminary step of just knowing
in- and out-breaths. The Śrāvakabhūmi, Shukla 1973: 230,1 or ŚSG 2007: 96,1 and T 1579 at T XXX
432a29, agrees in this respect with [[SA810]] as it also speaks of “training”, śik�ate/, right away from
the preliminary step of just knowing in- and out-breaths. Nevertheless, from the perspective of textual
transmission it seems more likely that the detail of not applying the expression ‘training’ to the first and
second phases of practice was subsequently forgotten, instead of imagining that it could have been in- 解脫道論
troduced at a later stage.

Ānāpānasati-sutta recurs in the Arthaviniścaya-sūtra and in the Path to Liberation (Vimuttimagga), [139] the sequence adopted in the Sa�yukta-āgama version recurs in the
Śrāvakabhūmi and in the so-called Yogalehrbuch. [140]
The Ānāpānasati-sutta and its parallel agree that the first four steps of mindfulness of
breathing fulfil the first satipa��hāna of body contemplation, as by undertaking them
one contemplates something that pertains to the body. [141]
According to both versions, the next four steps of mindfulness of breathing correspond to the second satipa��hāna, mindfulness of feelings. The Majjhima-nikāya version explains that the second tetrad of mindfulness of breathing fulfils the second satipa��hāna because to give close attention to the breath should be understood as a certain
feeling among feelings. [142] The Sa�yukta-āgama version instead explains that practice
of the second tetrad involves giving attention to a type of feeling. It thus continues with
the same mode of explanation that both versions had adopted in their earlier correlation
between the first tetrad of mindfulness of breathing and the first satipa��hāna. [143]

regard to the description of this and subsequent tetrads is that [[MN118]] in each case indicates that such
contemplation is undertaken with diligence, clear comprehension, mindfulness, and while being free
from desires or discontent in regard to the world, MN III 83,35: ātāpī sampajāno satimā, vineyya loke

attention as a feeling. Although paying close attention to the breath would lead to deeper concentration
and therewith to the arising of pleasant feelings, to speak of attention to the breaths as a type of feeling 爾時身身觀念住異於身者
does not seem to fit too well with the usage of the term 異於身者 “attention”, manasikāra, in other discourses. Ps

and does not intend “attention”, manasikāra, itself, but only its objects.

670   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


According to the Majjhima-nikāya version, the third tetrad of mindfulness of breathing corresponds to contemplation of the mind because mindfulness of breathing cannot
be properly developed without mindfulness and clear comprehension. [144] The Sa�yuktaāgama version simply explains that practice undertaken in this way is to give attention
to the mind, thereby continuing with the type of explanation that it had for the earlier
two tetrads. [145]
In regard to the final four steps of mindfulness of breathing, the Majjhima-nikāya
version explains that this tetrad should be reckoned as contemplation of dharmas because at this stage a meditator has seen with wisdom that desires and discontent have
been overcome and inspects properly and with equanimity. [146] The Sa�yukta-āgama


and variant reading instead of, in analogy to the formulation found in [[SA810]] for contemplation of the mind and contemplation of dharmas). This explanation seems quite straightforward,
since just as by being aware of the breath one is mindful of an aspect of the body, so too by being
aware of feelings of joy and happiness and by calming such feelings during the second tetrad of mindfulness of breathing one is indeed mindful of feelings.
144 [[MN118]] at MN III 84,23: “I do not say that there is development of mindfulness of breathing for someone who is without mindfulness and clear comprehension”, nāha� ... mu��hassatissa asampajānassa
ānāpānasatibhāvana� vadāmi (B [e] -MN III 127,4: ānāpānassati�, S [e] -MN III 197,1: ānāpānasati�).
This explanation is also to some extent puzzling, since one may wonder why the need for mindfulness
and clear comprehension qualifies the third tetrad of mindfulness of breathing as an equivalent to contemplation of the mind. In fact, mindfulness and clear comprehension would already be required during 明 隨受 受隨身
the preceding steps of mindfulness of breathing. Although their presence at the present juncture might
be particularly called for, so as to enable undertaking the more subtle contemplation of the mind, their
presence would similarly be required when undertaking the final tetrad of mindfulness of breathing.
That is, the statement that mindfulness and clear comprehension are required to develop mindfulness of
breathing would apply to the entire set of sixteen steps and does not really explain why the third tetrad
should be reckoned as an instance of contemplation of the mind in particular. Ps IV 141,23 explains
that, even though the sign of breathing in and breathing out is the object, when a meditator establishes
mindfulness and clear comprehension on the object of the mind, this form of practice should be reckoned as contemplation of the mind. This is certainly true, but then the same could be said for the preceding and subsequent steps of mindfulness of breathing as well, as these similarly require mindfulness
and clear comprehension, but would nevertheless not be reckoned as instances of contemplation of the
mind.
145 [[SA810]] at T II 208b8: “at that time [in regard to] the mind he contemplates the mind with mindfulness
established on what is a certain [state of] mind”, . In this case, too, the
Sa�yukta-āgama version’s explanation seems quite straightforward, as by experiencing, gladdening,
concentrating, and liberating the mind, this particular way of developing mindfulness of breathing becomes indeed an instance of contemplation of the mind.
146 [[MN118]] at MN III 84,34: ya� ta� abhijjhādomanassāna� pahāna� ta� paññāya disvā sādhuka� ajjhupekkhitā hoti (S [e] -MN III 197,10: yan ta� and pahāna� paññāya, without ta�). According to the
commentarial gloss, Ps IV 142,4, the reference to desires and discontent in this explanation intends the
five hindrances, which form the beginning of contemplation of dharmas in [[MN10]] Yet, while [[MN118]]
speaks of desires and discontent being overcome, in the case of contemplation of the hindrances in [[MN10]] at MN I 60,11 the hindrances have not yet been overcome, santa� vā ajjhatta� kāmacchanda� ... iti
ajjhatta� vā dhammesu dhammānupassī viharati. Thus if, in accordance with the specification in MN 爾時心心觀念住若有異心者
118, it were characteristic of contemplation of dharmas that desires have already been overcome, then


Chapter 12 Anupada-vagga                                    -  671


parallel does not mention desires and discontent when relating the fourth tetrad of
mindfulness of breathing to the fourth satipa��hāna. Instead, this version simply
explains that practice undertaken in this way is to give attention to dharmas, thereby
continuing with the same type of explanation that it had adopted for the previous three
tetrads. [147]
The Ānāpānasati-sutta and its Sa�yukta-āgama parallel continue by describing how,
once mindfulness becomes well established through satipa��hāna, the development of
mindfulness as an awakening factor takes place. The two versions continue by indicating that the remaining awakening factors arise in conditional dependence on each other,
leading from investigation-of-dharmas, [148] to energy, rapture, [149] tranquillity, concentration, and equanimity.


contemplation of the hindrances, or at the very least of the first hindrance of sensual desire, should not
be part of contemplation of dharmas in [[MN10]] Instead of taking the absence of desires and discontent
to be characteristic of the fourth satipa��hāna, perhaps their absence may better be understood to characterize a more advanced stage of practice, a stage that could be based on having developed any of the
four satipa��hānas. In fact, [[MN10]] at MN I 56,4 presents freedom from desires and discontent, vineyya
loke abhijjhādomanassa�, as something relevant to all four satipa��hānas, so that their absence need
not be confined to contemplation of dharmas. The need to stay aloof from abhijjhādomanassa recurs
also in the standard description of the practice of sense-restraint, cf., e.g., [[MN39]] at MN I 273,6, a practice that would also be relevant to all four satipa��hānas. Besides, to identify abhijjhādomanassa with
all five hindrances seems questionable, as according to [[MN44]] at MN I 304,1 some types of domanassa
are free from the underlying tendency to aversion, so that these might not be identifiable with the hindrance of ill will. The general usage of domanassa in the discourses also does not give the impression
as if this term implicitly stands for the hindrance of ill will, except for a single occurrence in [[SN45.15]] at
[[SNP1106]] In addition, one might also wonder why the present passage does not simply mention the remaining three hindrances of sloth-and-torpor, restlessness-and-worry, and doubt, if to refer to them had
been the original intention. However, at least in as much as the first hindrance of sensual desire is concerned, the identification made by the commentary finds support in a good number of discourses that
use abhijjhā instead of the more common kāmacchanda to refer to the first hindrance, cf. [[DN2]] at DN I
71,20, [[DN10]] at DN I 207,17, [[DN25]] at DN III 49,13, [[MN27]] at MN I 181,16, [[MN38]] at MN I 269,28,
[[MN39]] at MN I 274,35, [[MN51]] at MN I 347,1, [[MN94]] at MN II 162,9, [[MN101]] at MN II 226,8, [[MN107]] at MN III 3,27, [[MN112]] at MN III 35,25, [[MN125]] at MN III 135,28, [[AN4.198]] at AN II 210,34, [[AN5.75]] at AN III 92,24, [[AN10.40]] at AN III 100,11, [[AN9.40]] at AN IV 437,5, [[AN10.99]] at AN V 207,7,
and It 4:12 at It 118,13.
147 [[SA810]] at T II 208b11: “at that time [in regard to] dharmas he contemplates dharmas with mindfulness
established on a certain kind of dharma, that is indeed [how] he gives attention in accordance with dharmas”, . Thus in the present case, as well as in the case of the
correlation of the second and third tetrad of mindfulness of breathing with the second and third satipa��hāna, the explanations in [[SA810]] seem more straightforward than their counterparts in [[MN118]]
148 A minor difference is that, in its description of the investigating and scrutinizing activity of the dhammavicayasambojjha�ga, [[MN118]] at MN III 85,16 explicitly refers to the presence of wisdom, ta� dhamma� paññāya pavicinati pavicarati parivīma�sa� āpajjati (B [e] -MN III 128,1 and C [e] -MN III 232,22:
pavicayati), while [[SA810]] at T II 208b17 does not mention wisdom, reading only: “he discriminates
and examines the Dharma”, . The association of the awakening factor dhammavicaya
with wisdom is highlighted in particular in the Abhidharma, cf., e.g., Dhs 62,24, which includes this
awakening factor in its definition of the faculty of wisdom, paññindriya, or Vibh 229,26, which in its

672   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


According to the Majjhima-nikāya presentation, the last step in this sequence, concerned with progressing from concentration to equanimity, requires to inspect with
equanimity the concentrated state of mind. [150] The Sa�yukta-āgama account explains
that due to having overcome desires and discontent the mind at this stage reaches balance and equanimity. [151]

MN III 88  The Ānāpānasati-sutta and its Sa�yukta-āgama parallel conclude their presentation
by indicating that the awakening factors lead to knowledge and liberation when they


abhidhammabhājaniya equates the awakening factor dhammavicaya with various paññā synonyms.
Notably, Nett 82,26 includes not only the awakening factor dhammavicaya, but also the awakening factor of equanimity, upekkhāsambojjha�ga, in a listing of paññā synonyms. Vibh-[[AN313.5]] relates dhammavicayasambojjha�ga to insight knowledge, vipassanañā�a. Ps IV 143,8 explains that dhammavicayasambojjha�ga stands for knowledge conjoined with the development of mindfulness, satiyā sampayutta� ñā�a� dhammavicayasambojjha�go. Pe� 187,3 sums up: “what understands in accordance
with reality [when being] concentrated, that is the awakening factor of investigation-of-dharmas”, ya�
samāhito yathābhūta� pajānāti, aya� dhammavicayasambojjha�go. According to Mil 83,23, realization takes place through this particular awakening factor and is impossible without it, ekena ... bojjha�gena bujjhati, dhammavicayasambojjha�gena ... dhammavicayasambojjha�gena vinā chahi bojjha�gehi na bujjhati. Another noteworthy point in relation to the description of the activity of the
dhammavicayasambojjha�ga, given in [[MN118]] at MN III 85,16, is that dhamma here stands in the
singular, which suggests an inquiry into the Dharma as the “teaching”. Such an understanding finds
support in [[SN46.3]] at SN V 67,27, which describes the development of this awakening factor based on
having heard, remembered, and reflected on the teaching, dhamma� sutvā ... ta� dhamma� anussarati
anuvitakketi. An examination of the development of the same awakening factor in [[SN46.52]] at SN V
111,1 speaks instead of contemplating dharmas internally and externally, ajjhatta� dhammesu and bahiddhā dhammesu, where the plural form conveys the sense of “phenomena” in general; cf. also the
discussion in Gethin 1992a: 147-154. The Chinese counterpart to [[SN46.52]] [[SA713]] at T II 191b25,
confirms this, as according to its presentation the task of this particular awakening factor is to distinguish between wholesome phenomena and unwholesome phenomena, and . [[SN56.51]] at
SN V 104,8 also reflects this function of the awakening factor dhammavicaya, which it expresses by
presenting proper attention, yoniso manasikāra, in regard to wholesome and unwholesome things as the
nutriment for dhammavicayasambojjha�ga. This sets a direct contrast to the hindrance of doubt, since
according to [[SN56.51]] at SN V 106,11 proper attention in regard to wholesome and unwholesome
things is the antidote (literally “anti-nutriment”, anāhāra) to doubt. That is, from an early Buddhist perspective the way to overcome doubt requires the type of investigation that corresponds to the development of the dhammavicayasambojjha�ga.
149 [[MN118]] at MN III 85,33 qualifies this rapture to be “non-worldly”, nirāmisa, a qualification not made
in [[SA810]]
150 [[MN118]] at MN III 86,16: tathāsamāhita� citta� sādhuka� ajjhupekkhitā hoti 善法 . 不善法
151 [[SA810]] at T II 208b26:, . In this way, [[SA810]] explicitly presents the absence of desires and discontent as characteristic for the progression to the seventh awakening factor, which indeed
marks an advanced level of practice. This further supports my earlier suggestion that contemplation of
dharmas in itself need not imply the absence of desires and discontent, nor does the absence of desires
and discontent need to be restricted to the fourth satipa��hāna. In fact, even though the seven awakening factors come under the fourth satipa��hāna in [[MN10]] at MN I 61,32, [[MN118]] explicitly relates their
development to each of the four satipa��hānas. This goes to show that the advanced stages of practice,
when desires and discontent are overcome and the awakening factor of equanimity becomes well established, need not be confined to contemplation of dharmas, but can take place with each satipa��hāna.

are developed in dependence on seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, thereby culminating in relinquishment or letting go. [152]


[[MN119]] Kāyagatāsati-sutta

The Kāyagatāsati-sutta, the “discourse on mindfulness of the body”, describes the
development and benefits of mindfulness of the body. This discourse has a parallel in
the Madhyama-āgama. [153]
The Kāyagatāsati-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel begin by reporting that the
Buddha visited a group of monks, [154] who had just been conversing on the Buddha’s
disclosure of the benefits of mindfulness of the body. [155] In both versions, the Buddha
then gave a full exposition of this topic, an exposition that covers the exercises listed
under contemplation of the body in the Satipa��hāna-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama
parallel. [156]
In addition to the contemplations found in the Satipa��hāna-sutta, the Kāyagatāsatisutta and its parallel also examine the effect of the four jhānas on the body. [157] While
the Kāyagatāsati-sutta at first describes the attainment of each jhāna, before turning to
the effect of the jhāna on the body, its Madhyama-āgama parallel dispenses with this
description and directly takes up the effect each jhāna has on the body. This mode of


152 [[MN118]] at MN III 88,3: vivekanissita�, virāganissita�, nirodhanissita�, vossaggapari�āmi�, and [[SA810]] at T II 208c3: .
153 The parallel is [[MA81]] at T I 554c-557c, which agrees with [[MN119]] on the title ( ) and takes
place at the village Āpa�a in the A�ga country, whereas [[MN119]] takes place in Jeta’s Grove by Sāvatthī. [[MA81]] has been translated by Kuan 2007, for remarks on [[MA81]] cf. Minh Chau 1964/1991: 107,
108, and 145. For a discourse quotation in Abhidh-k-� cf. below note 156.
154 According to [[MA81]] at T I 554c22, the Buddha had overheard the discussion of the monks with his divine ear and thereon decided to approach them.
155 While [[MN119]] at MN III 88,22 simply qualifies mindfulness of the body to be of great fruit and benefit, mahapphala mahānisa�sa, [[MA81]] at T I 554c20 speaks of it being of “great fruit, [leading to] attaining vision, to being endowed with the ‘eye’ that sees the highest benefit”,
. 依遠離, 依無欲, 依滅, 向於捨

four postures, various activities, the anatomical parts of the body, the four elements, and the cemetery
contemplations. Similar to [[MA98]] (the parallel to [[MN10]]), [[MA81]] takes up mindfulness of the four
postures, various activities, overcoming unwholesome states of mind, forceful control of the mind,
mindfulness of breathing, the physical experience of the four jhānas, development of awareness of
light, attending to the sign of [reviewing] contemplation, the anatomical parts of the body, the six elements, and the cemetery contemplations. For a more detailed examination of the differences between
these two expositions of body contemplation cf. above p. 80. A discourse quotation with the listing of
anatomical parts (not necessarily specific to the present instance) can be found in Abhidh-k 7:27 in 大果報, 得眼, 有目見

approach makes it quite clear that it is not the attainment of jhāna as such, but rather
the bodily experience caused by a jhāna that comes under the heading of mindfulness
of the body.

MN III 92  The Kāyagatāsati-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel illustrate the bodily experience of the four jhānas with the same set of similes. In regard to the simile employed
for the second jhāna, which describes a lake that does not receive any water from outside and is fed only by water that wells up from within the lake itself, the Madhyamaāgama version additionally mentions that this lake is fed by a pure mountain spring. [158]

MN III 94   A minor difference can also be found in relation to the fourth jhāna simile, which describes a man seated and covered from head to toe with a cloth. The Madhyama-āgama
version indicates that the cloth used to cover the man is seven or eight cubits long,
without, however, describing the colour of the cloth. [159]


158 [[MA81]] at T I 555b29: “a mountain spring, completely pure and clean”, . The same image can also be found in version of this simile in [[DA20]] at T I 85b21: “like a clear spring of water at the
top of a mountain”, . A version of this simile in the Sa�ghabhedavastu and in an individual translation similarly speaks of a pond that is located on top of a mountain, cf. Gnoli 1978a: 243,18:
“a pond at the top of a mountain”, upariparvata� ... udakahrado (cf. also fragment 512v1 in Wille
1990: 125) and T 13 at T I 234c1: “a spring water pond on top of a hillside”, . The specification of the lake’s location on a mountaintop clarifies why such a lake would not receive any water
from outside, but is only fed by a mountain spring from inside. At the same time, this specification
highlights the aloofness reached by attaining the second jhāna, an experience of non-sensual pleasure
born not only of seclusion but of concentration proper, resulting in a unified and totally tranquil state of
mind. Although the first jhāna is already aloof through being “secluded from sensuality 山泉, 極淨澄清 ”, vivicc’ eva
kāmehi, it nevertheless is an experience which due to is proximity to sensuality has not yet reached
total aloofness. This can be seen in [[SN40.1]] at SN IV 263, 如山頂涼泉水 16, according to which Mahāmoggallāna’s
attainment of the first jhāna was disturbed by the “arising of attention to perceptions related to sensuality”, kāmasahagatā saññā manasikārā samudācaranti. With the attainment of the second jhāna, the
level of concentration is not only “born of seclusion”, but additionally “born of concentration 阪頭泉水池 ” proper,
samādhija� pītisukha�, a state of “mental unification that is internally tranquil”, ajjhatta� sampasādana� cetaso ekodibhāva� and thereby more decisively aloof from any disturbance than the first jhāna
(cf. [[MN119]] at MN III 93,5). The image of a pure lake on top of a mountain, self-sufficient and independent of any external source, aptly conveys such aloofness and tranquillity. According to the Path to
Liberation (Vimuttimagga/ ), the same is also implicit in the reference to the absence of any
inflow of water from the outside, which stands representative for the absence of initial and sustained
application of the mind in the second jhāna, T 1648 at T XXXII 418c27. The same work explains that
the welling up of water from within, which causes no waves, illustrates the welling up of happiness and
joy born of concentration that completely pervade body and mind without causing any mental agitation.
The Path to Liberation also offers helpful comments on the simile used to illustrate the first jhāna. According to T 1648 at T XXXII 417b8, bath powder in its natural state can easily be scattered by the
wind (here it needs to be kept in mind that in ancient India bathing usually would have been undertaken
out in the open, such as by the side of a river, cf., e.g., [[MN81]] at MN II 46,21 or [[MN93]] at MN II
151,19). Similarly, a mind without joy and concentration will easily be scattered by the ‘wind’ of the
five hindrances. Thus joy, happiness, and concentration are to the mind what water is to the bath pow- 解脫道論
der, whose kneading is comparable to the action of initial and sustained application of the mind.
159 [[MA81]] at T I 555c19: “clothes/robes of seven units length or clothes/robes of eight units length”,
. [[DA30]] at T I 133a12 uses the same measurement given in [[MA81]] and explains that

The Majjhima-nikāya version does not give the size of the cloth, but notes that it is of
white colour. [160] An individual translation of the Sa�gīti-sutta also gives the size of the
cloth, in addition to which it indicates that this cloth is white, a colour also mentioned
in a Dīrgha-āgama version of this simile. [161] According to the Yogācārabhūmi, the
whiteness of the cloth in this simile stands representative for the mental purity reached
with the fourth jhāna. [162]


seven units length corresponds to the average height of a person, . The character in the
Āgamas usually refers to “robes”, although in the present instance it could also stand for “clothing” in
general. Hirakawa 1997: 1048 lists cīvara, vastra, cela, pa�a as equivalents for, a character translated by Soothill 1937/2000: 222 as “clothes, especially a monk’s robes”. The measurements given in
[[MA81]] would roughly correspond to the size of a monk’s robe, cf. pācittiya rule 92 at Vin IV 173,24,
according to which the proper size for a robe is less than six sugata spans by nine sugata spans (on the
sugata span, sugatavidatthi, cf. also Sp III 567,21 and Thanissaro 1994/2007: 565-566). The idea behind this image could thus be taken from actual experience, as at times an itinerant monk who sits
down to meditate may cover himself in this way with his robes as a protection against flies and mosquitoes; cf., e.g., [[SN7.9]] at SN I 167,27 (or SN [2] 195 at SN [2] I 359,7) and [[SNP3.4]] at Sn p. 80,2, which, together with their parallels [[SA1184]] at T II 320b24 and SĀ [2] 99 at T II 408c 人身長七肘 28, describe the Buddha 衣
seated in meditation with his head covered with his robe. [[SA1184]] and SĀ [2] 99 explain that the Buddha
had just shaved his head, so that he may indeed have covered himself with his robe in order to protect 衣
his freshly shaven head. The image of such protection against external disturbances by being totally
covered with a robe would well illustrate the mental state of imperturbability that is reached through
attaining the fourth jhāna. Just as by covering himself with his robe a monk would create the suitable
conditions for developing his meditation practice, so by attaining the fourth jhāna he would create the
suitable condition for developing various supernormal powers and higher meditative attainments. Although Ps II 323,3 does not bring in flies and mosquitoes, it also takes the point of the image of the cloth
to be related to the body, as it explains that the man’s body is kept warm by the cloth. T 1648 at T XXXII
420c2 similarly understands the image to imply protection from heat or cold through being completely
covered by the white cloth.
160 [[MN119]] at MN III 94,17 speaks of a “white cloth”, odāta vattha, thereby making it clear that from its
perspective this would not be a monk’s robe.
161 T 13 at T I 234c14 illustrates the effect of the fourth jhāna with the example of a member of any of the
four classes who covers himself with a white cloth that is eight to nine units long (T 12 uses, which
according to Mathews 1963: 21 stands for “a measure of ten feet”. Applying this measurement would
result in a huge cloth, so that in the present context is perhaps best taken to refer to a unit of length
corresponding approximately to ). [[DA20]] at T I 85c4 speaks of “using a new white piece of cloth to
cover the body”,, without giving any measurements.
162 T 1579 at T XXX 339c8. The purity reached with this deep level of concentration is explicitly mentioned in the standard descriptions of the fourth jhāna as upekhāsatipārisuddhi, cf., e.g., [[MN119]] at
MN III 94,11, a qualification referred to in Madhyama-āgama discourses as, e.g., [[MA2]] at T
I 422b22. In its description of the effect of the fourth jhāna on the body, [[MN119]] at MN III 94,13 describes this purity in terms of the pure mind that pervades the whole body, parisuddhena cetasā ... pharitvā, an experience which [[MA81]] at T I 555c18 depicts in the following terms: “in regard to this body, 丈
he dwells having accomplished its complete pervasion within by means of purity of the mind and mental understanding”, 丈 . Thus the image used to illustrate the fourth
jhāna in [[MN119]] and [[MA81]] may convey the idea of protecting the body just as it may exemplify men- 肘
tal purity (yet another interpretation is suggested by Schlingloff 1962b: 62, who takes the image of the 以新白疊被覆其身
white cloth that completely covers the meditator to represent the brilliancy and clarity of the heavenly

After each of the body contemplations, the Kāyagatāsati-sutta explains that practising diligently in this manner will lead to overcoming thoughts related to the household
life and to concentrating the mind. [163] Its Madhyama-āgama counterpart similarly speaks
of practising diligently in order to develop concentration, without, however, mentioning
the removal of thoughts related to the household life. [164]
The Kāyagatāsati-sutta next highlights that mindfulness of the body includes all
wholesome things, which it compares to developing an awareness that encompasses the
whole ocean, in the sense that such awareness would automatically include all the rivers that flow into the ocean. [165] The Madhyama-āgama version makes a similar proclamation, differing in so far as it describes how on flowing into the great ocean all rivers
become parts of it, without mentioning any awareness of the ocean. [166]


spheres). It is noteworthy that according to the explanation given in the Pāli commentary the cloth protects the body, an idea that also suggests itself from the wording of the Madhyama-āgama simile, whereas the explanation offered in the Yogācārabhūmi fits well with the simile found in the Majjhima-nikāya.
163 [[MN119]] at MN III 89,21: “by dwelling diligently, ardently, and resolutely in this way, memories and
intentions related to the household life are abandoned, and with their abandoning the mind becomes internally ... concentrated”, evam appamattassa ātāpino pahitattassa viharato ye ... gehasitā sarasa�kappā te pahīyanti, tesa� pahānā ajjhattam eva citta� ... samādhiyati.
164 [[MA81]] at T I 555a15: “in this way, dwelling alone in a secluded spot, with a mind that is not negligent
he practises energetically, removes distress from the mind, and attains concentration of the mind;
having attained concentration of the mind, he knows the above [i.e. what has been mentioned earlier] as
it really is”, .
Notably, both discourses apply this description to all of the body contemplations in their respective
lists, and thereby also to the bodily experience of the four jhānas. In [[MA81]] this is less problematic,
since this application results only in the proposition that diligent practice of the four jhānas will develop concentration, although it would perhaps have been more natural to propose that the diligent
practice of concentration will lead to developing the four jhānas. In the case of [[MN119]] this passage
becomes considerably more puzzling, since the Pāli discourse follows the attainment of each of the four
jhānas by describing how, by abiding in this way, thoughts related to the household life can be overcome, whose removal then leads to settling and concentrating the mind. Yet, to attain the jhānas would
require that the mind has already been settled and concentrated and that thoughts related to the household have long been left behind. Thus, [[MN119]] seems to present a stage of practice preliminary to 如是 在遠離獨住, 心無放逸, 修行精勤, 斷心諸患而得定心, 得定心已, 則知上如真
jhāna attainment as if it were an outcome of jhāna attainment. This suggests that perhaps at some comparatively early stage during the discourse’s transmission the description of diligent practice was added
to the treatment of each of the jhānas, even though this description does not fit too well with the content of the passage to which it was appended. From the perspective of the dynamics of oral transmission, it could easily be imagined how the description of diligent practice, which anyway was to be repeated after each of the other body contemplations, was accidentally also applied to the treatment of the
jhānas during recitation.
165 [[MN119]] at MN III 94,25. As an illustration of mindfulness of the body, this simile recurs in [[AN1.21]] at
AN I 43,13. Kuan 2008: 131 points out that the image of the ocean as the converging point of all waters
can also be found in the B�hadāra�yaka Upani�ad 2.4.11, cf. Radhakrishnan 1953/1992: 199: sarvāsām

The two versions agree in illustrating the ability to withstand Māra, once one is established in mindfulness of the body, with a set of similes that contrast:

 - throwing a heavy ball at a wet mud wall with throwing a light ball at a door panel,

 - trying to light a fire with dry wood with attempting to do the same with wet wood,

 - pouring water into an empty jug with attempting to do the same with a full jug.
They differ, however, in the sequence of their presentation (see table 12.8). [167]
The Majjhima-nikāya version continues with another set of three similes, which describe the ability of reaching any attainment based on mindfulness of the body to being
able to tip over a full water jug, to loosen the embankment of a full pond so that water
will flow out, and to drive a chariot wherever one wishes. [168] These three similes are not
found in the Madhyama-āgama version (see table 12.8).

The two versions conclude by listing the benefits to be reached through mindfulness
of the body (see table 12.9). [169] They agree in listing the abilities to conquer:

  - discontent, [170]

  - fear,

  - the vicissitudes of climate and hunger, etc.
A benefit of mindfulness of the body mentioned only in the Madhyama-āgama account is that the three types of unwholesome intention will not be able to overwhelm


167 The pair-wise arrangement in [[MA81]] thus provides the contrast to each image immediately.
168 The same similes recur in [[AN5.28]] at AN III 27,26, where they illustrate how, based on developing five
types of right concentration, any attainment can be reached. The image of driving a chariot recurs in
[[MN21]] at MN I 124,18 to illustrate the willingness of the early generation of monks to follow the Buddha’s instructions, while in [[SN35.198]] at SN IV 176,16 the same image illustrates control of the senses.
169 A listing of the benefits to be obtained through developing mindfulness of the body can also be found
in [[AN1.21]] at AN I 43-46.

170 In relation to discontent, it is perhaps noteworthy that [[MN119]] at MN III 97,20 speaks of conquering
discontent and delight, aratiratisaho, but then treats only the topic of discontent. [[MA81]] at T I 557b13
consistently speaks only of discontent: “he bears discontent, if discontent arises, the mind nevertheless
does not hold on to it”, . For a similar case cf. above p. 47 note 105.

the mind. [171] Other benefits of a higher nature, found in both versions, are that mindfulness of the body enables attaining:

  - the jhānas,

  - the supernormal knowledges,

  - the destruction of the influxes.


Table 12.9: Benefits of Body Contemplation According to [[MN119]] and [[MA187]]

|[[MN119]]|[[MA187]]|
|---|---|
|conquer discontent (1)<br>conquer fear (2)<br>bear cold, heat, hunger, thirst, etc. (3)<br>fourjhānas (4)<br>supernormal powers (5)<br>divine ear (6)<br>know others’ minds (7)<br>recollect past lives (8)<br>divine eye (9)<br>destruction of influxes (10)|bear cold, heat, hunger, thirst, etc. (→ 3)<br>endure discontent (→ 1)<br>endure fear (→ 2)<br>not be overwhelmed by unwholesome thoughts<br>4 jhānas (→ 4)<br>stream-entry<br>once-return<br>non-return<br>immaterial attainments<br>supernormal powers, divine ear, know others’<br>minds, recollect past lives, know re-arising of<br>beings, destroy influxes (→ 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)|



To the destruction of the influxes, the Madhyama-āgama version adds the other three
stages of awakening (which would be implicit in the Majjhima-nikāya version). [172] In
addition to the four jhānas, the Madhyama-āgama discourse also mentions the immaterial attainments. [173] Thus, with some differences in their respective listings, the two versions agree that a broad range of benefits can be expected from diligent undertaking of
mindfulness of the body.


[[MN120]] Sa�khāruppatti-sutta [174]
The Sa�khāruppatti-sutta, the “discourse on re-arising [in a particular way by means
of an] aspiration”, describes how an aspiration can influence the mode of one’s rebirth.
A discourse in the Madhyama-āgama takes up the same topic, although its mode of

171 [[MA81]] at T I 577b17.
172 [[MA81]] at T I 557b22. Due to these additional five benefits and because of considering each of the four
jhānas as a single benefit, [[MA81]] at T I 557b9 counts eighteen benefits,, whereas [[MN119]] at
MN III 97,18 counts ten benefits, dasa ānisa�[[SA173]] [[MA81]] at T I 577c2. In its description of the attainment of the immaterial spheres, [[MA81]]at T I 557c3
already refers to the destruction of the influxes, which reads as if instead of the immaterial spheres it
were to be taking up the attainment of cessation. [[MA81]] moreover, presents the four immaterial attainments as a single benefit, whereas it earlier reckoned the four jhānas as four benefits. These irregularities suggest that a textual error may have occurred in this passage.
174 Be-MN III 140,12 and Se-MN III 217,1 have the title Sa�khārupapatti-sutta, while Ps II 106,26 refers to
the present discourse as Sa�khārabhājanīya-sutta.
十八德


Chapter 12 Anupada-vagga                                    -  679


presentation is different to such an extent that these two discourses do not seem to be
“parallels” properly speaking. [175]
The Sa�khāruppatti-sutta lists various possible rebirths, covering:

 - the human realm,

 - the sensuous heavens,

 - the Brahmā worlds,

 - the immaterial realms.
According to its exposition, a monk may be reborn in any of these realms if he aspires to such rebirth and has:

 - faith,

 - virtue,

 - learning,

 - renunciation,

 - wisdom.
The Madhyama-āgama discourse only covers rebirth in the Brahmā worlds and the
four immaterial realms. According to its presentation, to be reborn in these realms requires developing the corresponding meditative attainment. One who develops the first
jhāna, for example, will later on be reborn in the Brahmā world corresponding to the
first jhāna.
In this way, the Madhyama-āgama discourse indicates that meditation practice undertaken successfully leads to rebirth in these realms. [176] It explains that rebirth takes
place in this way because the experience of the particular jhāna that has been developed corresponds to the experience of the respective Brahmā world. [177]
The treatment given in these two discourses thus differs not only in regard to the
range of rebirth modes taken into account, but also about the principle responsible for
such rebirth. While the Madhyama-āgama discourse relates rebirth in a particular realm
to having developed the corresponding meditative attainment, the Majjhima-nikāya


175 [[MA168]] at T I 700b-701b, which agrees with [[MN120]] on locating the discourse in Jeta’s Grove by Sāvatthī and has the title “discourse on mental practice”, . Although usually stands for sa�khāra, judging from the way is used in [[MA168]] it seems to stand rather for “practice” in the present
context. Minh Chau 1964/1991: 143 highlights the degree to which the theme of the conditions for rebirth “is ... differently treated in both versions”. On [[MA168]] cf. also Schmithausen 1987: 355 note 204.
Besides [[MA168]] another probable parallel is Senior Kharo��hī fragment 10 (I am indebted to Mark
Allon for kindly providing me with a preliminary draft transliteration of this fragment); cf. also Allon
2008: 166. Fragment 10 recto b5 appears to have preserved a reference to rebirth among wealthy families and recto c-h10-11 to rebirth among what in Pāli are the nimmānaratī and paranimmitavasavattino
devā. Fragment 10 verso h-c10+13 refers to the Brahmā of Five Thousand and verso b2 and [[AN2]] to the
Brahmā of Ten Thousand, cf. also recto c-h16.
176 [[MA168]] at T I 700c9: “he is reborn according to his mental practice 意行經 ”, 行 .
177 E.g., in relation to the first 行 jhāna, [[MA168]] at T I 700c7 explains that “these two [types of] joy and happiness arisen from seclusion are not different, the two are completely equal ... one who first practises
this concentration will later be reborn there”,

version’s exposition centres on the idea of being reborn through the power of an aspiration, based on a set of qualities that do not mention the development of concentration.
A related treatment can be found in the Sa�gīti-sutta and a discourse in the A�guttara-nikāya, which describe how on giving a gift someone may aspire to rebirth in upper
families or in the heavenly realms of the sensuous sphere. These two discourses present
the development of such an aspiration in terms similar to the Sa�khāruppatti-sutta, [178]
and also stipulate the need of a foundation in morality for such an aspiration to come
true. [179] Although the Sa�gīti-sutta and the A�guttara-nikāya discourse do not explicitly
identify the person who develops such an aspiration, [180] the circumstance that the aspiration is based on giving a gift suggests that a lay aspirant is intended. In the Sa�khāruppatti-sutta, however, the one who aspires to rebirth in an upper-class human family
or in a sense-sphere heaven is a monk. [181] The Sa�gīti-sutta and the A�guttara-nikāya
discourse also envisage rebirth in the Brahmā world, in relation to which they additionally stipulate the need to go beyond sensuality. [182]

178 [[DN33]] at DN III 258,25 (cf. also [[AN8.35]] at AN IV 239,13): ta� citta� dahati, ta� citta� adhi��hāti,
ta� citta� bhāveti, which parallels [[MN120]] at MN III 99,27: ta� citta� dahati, ta� citta� adhi��hāti,
ta� citta� bhāveti (S [e] -MN III 217,12: padahati instead of dahati).
179 [[DN33]] at DN III 259,1: “I say this [is the case] of a virtuous one, not of one who is not virtuous. Friends,
the mental aspiration of the virtuous one thrives due to its purity”, tañ ca kho sīlavato vadāmi, no dussīlassa. ijjhat’, āvuso, sīlavato cetopa�idhi suddhattā (B [e] -DN III 214,19, C [e] -DN III 442,12, and S [e] -DN
III 272,8: visuddhattā); cf. also [[AN8.35]] at AN IV 239,17. An exposition of rebirth due to an aspiration
in the Sa�gītiparyāya, T 1536 at T XXVI 442c15, similarly highlights the causal function of the purity
of virtue,, which a treatment of the same subject in the Dharmaskandha presents in terms of
pure action by way of the three doors, T 1537 at T XXVI 506b3: .
180 [[DN33]] at DN III 258,17 and [[AN8.35]] at AN IV 239,4 simply speak of “some”, ekacco, corresponding
to in the Sa�gītiparyāya, T 1536 at T XXVI 442c6, and in the Dharmaskandha, T 1537 at T XXVI
506a29.
181 [[MN120]] at MN III 100,17 introduces the aspiration to be reborn in a heavenly realm of the sense-sphere
by describing that the aspirant has heard that the inhabitants of this realm are “long-lived, beautiful and
enjoy great happiness”, dīghāyukā va��avanto sukhabahulā ti. Thus, what motivates the wish to be reborn in such a realm is quite different from the aspiration to reach liberation from any type of rebirth,
which according to a standard pericope in the early discourses is the normative motivation for going
forth, cf., e.g., [[MN7]] at MN I 40, 尸羅淨故 2. Vetter 2000: 45 remarks that, although wisdom is mentioned as one
of the prerequisites for the aspiration to lead to a particular rebirth, 三妙行 the same quality has clearly not been
fully “developed. If it were, the monk would not wish to be reborn somewhere”. In fact, for a monk to
aspire to rebirth in a sense-sphere heaven is something [[MN16]] at MN I 102, 一類 9 considers a mental bondage, cetaso vinibandha. [[AN7.47]] at AN IV 55,21 scornfully treats such an aspiration as being bound to
sexuality; cf. above p. 129 note 148. The disdain for such aspiration is of such degree that, if someone
were to ask the monks if they were living the holy life for the sake of being born in a heavenly sphere,
this would cause them to feel repelled, ashamed, and disgusted, cf. [[AN3.18]] at AN I 115,4. In view of
this, it is remarkable that according to [[MN120]] the one who formulates such an aspiration is a monk.
182 [[DN33]] at DN III 260,1: “I say this [is the case] for a virtuous one, not for one who is not virtuous, for
one who is free from lust, not for one who is with lust. Friends, the mental aspiration of the virtuous
one thrives due to its freedom from lust”, tañ ca kho sīlavato vadāmi, no dussīlassa, vītarāgassa, no
sarāgassa. ijjhat’, āvuso, sīlavato cetopa�idhi vītarāgattā; cf. also [[AN8.35]] at AN IV 241,7. The Sa�gītiparyāya, T 1536 at T XXVI 442c19, similarly highlights the importance of freedom from lust for


Chapter 12 Anupada-vagga                                    -  681


Similar to the Madhyama-āgama version, another discourse in the A�guttara-nikāya
explains that rebirth in the Brahmā worlds is to be expected of those who develop the
jhānas. [183] The next discourse in the same A�guttara-nikāya collection then presents insightful contemplation of such jhāna attainment as the condition for rebirth in the Pure
Abodes. [184]
The examination of various modes of rebirth in the Sa�khāruppatti-sutta culminates
with the destruction of the influxes. According to its presentation, a monk who aspires
to this goal will realize the destruction of the influxes and thereby go beyond any mode
of rebirth, if he has faith, virtue, learning, renunciation, and wisdom. [185]
The Madhyama-āgama discourse also has the destruction of the influxes as its culmination point. In line with its presentation of levels of rebirth reached through developing the jhānas and the immaterial attainments, it describes how a monk goes beyond
the attainment of neither-perception-nor-non-perception and attains the cessation of
perceptions and feelings, [186] which it reckons the supreme and most excellent type of
concentration, [187] as a monk who has reached it has completely transcended dukkha.


rebirth in the Brahmā world, . The Dharmaskandha, T 1537 at T XXVI 506b14, however, stipulates the corresponding meditative attainment, similar to [[MA168]] cf. also Schmithausen 1987: 356
note 211b. This highlights another curiosity in the treatment in [[MN120]] which presents the same set of
conditions for all of its rebirth perspectives, without making any distinctions. Thus, just as faith, virtue,
learning, renunciation, and wisdom are required for rebirth in a good householder family, so the same
qualities serve their purpose for rebirth in the different Brahmā worlds, including the Pure Abodes and
the immaterial realms. For rebirth in these quite different realms, some additional specification would
fit the context better, such as the removal of lust stipulated in [[DN33]] and [[AN8.35]] or the development
of the different jhānas, mentioned in [[MA168]] As it is, the presentation in [[MN120]] runs the risk of giving the misleading impression that the five qualities it mentions are all that is required for such elevated
rebirths. Ps IV 149,9 makes up for this by explaining that, in addition to the five qualities mentioned in 離欲
the discourse, the corresponding jhānas need to be developed, and for rebirth in the Pure Abodes insight up to non-return is required.

cessation while the same is absent in the Pāli version.
187 [[MA168]] at T I 701b13 illustrates the superiority of cessation attainment by comparing it to obtaining ghee
from milk. This simile occurs also in other Pāli discourses, cf., e.g., [[DN9]] at DN I 201,24, [[SN34.1-55]]
at SN III 264-278, [[AN4.95]] at AN II 95,28, [[AN5.181-190]] at AN III 219-220, and [[AN10.91]] at AN V

## Chapter 13 Suññata-vagga

[[MN121]] Cū�asuññata-sutta

The Cū�asuññata-sutta, the “lesser discourse on emptiness”, depicts the progress of a
gradual meditation on emptiness. This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama and a parallel preserved in Tibetan. [1]
The Cū�asuññata-sutta and its parallels begin with Ānanda inquiring if he rightly remembered an earlier occasion when the Buddha had proclaimed that he often dwelled in
emptiness. [2] The Buddha confirms that Ānanda has properly remembered this earlier
statement, [3] followed by explaining how to undertake such dwelling in emptiness.
In relation to the various steps to be taken during the gradual approach for such dwelling in emptiness, the Cū�asuññata-sutta and its parallels propose a similar mode of
contemplation. This contemplation is based on developing a unitary type of experi

1 The parallels are [[MA190]] at T I 736c-738a and the mdo chen po stong pa nyid ces bya ba, translated by
Jinamitra, Prajñāvarman, and Ye shes sde, D (290) or Q (956), edited in Skilling 1994a: 146-186. [[MA190]] and the Tibetan version agree with [[MN121]] on locating the discourse in the Hall of Migāra’s Mother
by Sāvatthī. While [[MA190]] agrees with [[MN121]] on the title ( ), the Tibetan version’s title would
correspond to Śūnyatā-nāma-mahāsūtra. [[MN121]] and [[MA190]] have been compared by Choong 1999:
66-76. All three versions of the present discourse have been studied by Schmithausen 1981: 232-239 and
Skilling 1997a: 335-363; cf. also Skilling 2007: 233-235. According to Skilling 1997a: 14 and 338, the
Tibetan version stems from a Madhyama-āgama collection that would have belonged to the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda tradition. For counterparts to [[MN121]] at MN III 104,7-11 in Vyākhyāyukti literature cf. Skilling
2000b: 343.
2 Skilling 1997a: 347 note 46 notes a minor difference, as in [[MN121]] at MN III 104,9 the Buddha speaks
of dwelling much in the ‘emptiness dwelling’, suññatāvihārenāha� ... etarahi bahula� viharāmī ti,
while the Chinese and Tibetan versions simply speak of dwelling much in ‘emptiness’, [[MA190]] at T I
737a4: and Skilling 1994a: 148,4: stong pa nyid kyis lan mang du gnas so 小空 經 . The idiomatic expression vihārena viharati is a recurring feature in the discourses (cf., e.g., [[DN16]] at DN II 130,35, [[MN151]] at MN III 294,2, [[SN21.3]] at SN II 275,22, [[AN6.10]] at AN III 284,26, etc.), listed by Wijesekera
1993: 84 as an example for the instrumental case that expresses “attendant circumstances”, so that this
difference would be mainly a matter of formulation.
3 This earlier statement by the Buddha has not been recorded elsewhere in the Pāli discourses. Skilling
1997a: 346 notes that the Vyākhyāyukti (cf. Lee 2001: 206,8) takes up the absence of a record of this saying “to demonstrate that the sūtra collection of the Śrāvakas is not complete: that it does not record every
teaching given by the Buddha” (cf. also Cabezón 1992: 227). Without intending to dispute the incompleteness of the collection of discourses, it could nevertheless be noted that the argument made in relation to the present instance does not seem to work too well. If the Buddha had given a full exposition of 多行空
the matter on that earlier occasion, Ānanda would not have needed to inquire about it again on the present occasion. This suggests that, on that former occasion, the Buddha made only the short statement
quoted in the present discourse. Such a short statement would then, due to its brevity, not have stood a
chance to be recorded as a discourse on its own. Other instances of this short statement, where monks
similarly declare that they often dwell in emptiness, are also not found on their own but occur as part of a
longer exposition, cf. [[MN151]] at MN III 294,4 and Vin II 304,12.

ence, [4] followed by considering this experience as devoid of the disturbances related to
the types of perception that at this stage have been left behind. [5] The three versions instruct to contemplate what is present as “existing” and at the same time as “empty” of
what has been left behind, [6] and conclude that in this way a genuine and undistorted approach to emptiness can be developed. [7]
According to the Cū�asuññata-sutta and its parallels, the Buddha began his exposition by highlighting the absence of any animals, possessions, or human beings – except
for the community of monks – in the forest where the discourse was taking place. [8]
The Chinese and Tibetan versions turn to the presence of the monk community as a
first step in their gradual approach to emptiness, presenting it in the same manner as all
the subsequent steps of practice in the gradual meditation on emptiness (see table 13.1). [9]


4 [[MN121]] at MN I 105,5+20 introduces each of its steps (e.g., for perception of earth) with the injunction
to “give attention to the unity dependent on” the particular perception to be developed, ºsañña� pa�icca
manasikaroti ekatta�, and concludes its treatment of each step by indicating that the experience based
on such unity is what remains at this point, ºsañña� pa�icca ekatta� (on ekatta� in the sense of a “uniform” perception cf. Schmithausen 1981: 233 note 122). [[MA190]] at T I 737a21+29 (e.g., for perception
of earth) instructs to be mindful of a “unitary” or “single” perception,, followed by concluding that what remains is such “unitary” or “single” perception, (a procedure absent from the
treatment of the community of monks in [[MA190]] at T I 737a9). The Tibetan version in Skilling 1994a:
156,3 and 160,1 (e.g., for perception of earth) instructs to give attention to unity, de las kha cig yid la
bya, and then concludes that what remains is the type of experience dependent on such unity, de las kha
cig la brten nas, thereby bringing in the idea of “dependence” found also in the Pāli version (I take kha
cig to be a confusion of ekatta or ekatva for ekacca or ekatya, as suggested by Skilling 1997a: 349).
5 [[MN121]] at MN III 104,23: ye assu darathā ... te ’dha na santi, [[MA190]] at T I 737a15:
, and the Tibetan version in Skilling 1994a: 154,1: nyon mongs pa’i gnas gang dag yin pa de dag
med. While [[MN121]] speaks first of the disturbances and then of contemplating what is there and what is
not there, the Chinese and Tibetan versions adopt the opposite sequence. The term 念一 ... 想 daratha, derived from
dara, for which Böhtlingk 1883/1998c: 70 s.v. dara gives “bersten, sprengen, zerreissen 唯一 ... 想 ” and MW: 470
s.v. dara “cleaving, breaking”, thus sets a contrast to the “unitary” character of these experiences, which
are developed by overcoming any daratha related to the perceptions that are to be left behind. On daratha cf. also Brough 1962/2001: 186 and Skilling 1997a: 352-355.

7 [[MN121]] at MN III 105,2 additionally qualifies this entry into emptiness as “pure”, parisuddha, a qualification not made in its Chinese and Tibetan parallels.
8 Although the items listed in the Tibetan version are more numerous than those listed in [[MN121]] and [[MA190]] the basic idea of the absence of animals, possessions, and human beings (except for the monks) is
the same in the three versions. For a discussion and survey of the listings in the three versions cf. Skilling
1997a: 348 and 363. Hayashima 1962: 758 and 765 notes that the early Buddhist conception of emptiness was closely related to the solitary and remote lifestyle of the Buddha and his disciples, something 若彼中無者, 以此故, 彼見是空, 若彼有餘者, 彼見真實有
particularly evident in the present instance.
9 In [[MA190]] at T I 737a10 it is the Buddha himself who views the absence of animals, etc., as empty and


Chapter 13 Suññata-vagga                                      -  685


The Chinese and Tibetan versions then proceed to perception of the forest, [10] which thus
forms the second step of the meditative development of emptiness in their versions. The
Pāli version, however, does not reckon awareness of the monk community as a stage in
itself, as it immediately continues by directing attention to perception of the forest. [11]
The step that follows perception of the forest in the gradual meditation on emptiness,
described in the Cū�asuññata-sutta and its parallels, requires developing a unitary perception of earth by not giving attention to such things as valleys and mountains, etc. [12]
The three versions illustrate this unitary perception of earth by comparing it to fixing
the hide of an ox with pegs until it is fully stretched and without any wrinkles. [13]
This process of mental abstraction by ‘emptying’ or ‘voiding’ the mind of its former
perceptions proceeds in the Cū�asuññata-sutta and its parallels from the perception of
earth to the perceptions of:

 - boundless space,

 - boundless consciousness,

 - nothingness.
The gradual approach to emptiness thus progresses through the types of perception
that correspond to the first three of the four immaterial attainments. Each time, the respective experience is contemplated in the following manner:

 - as empty of what is not there (the former perceptions),

 - as not empty of what is there (the present perception).
According to the Cū�asuññata-sutta and its parallels, in this way it becomes possible
to develop a genuine and undistorted meditative entry into emptiness. A minor difference is that, in relation to each perception, the Pāli discourse depicts how the mind gets
firmly established in the respective experience, a circumstance not mentioned in the
Chinese and Tibetan versions. [14]


the presence of the monks community as what is still there: “I contemplate it as empty”,, and
“I contemplate it as truly existing”,, whereas the ensuing steps of contemplation have a
monk as their subject,, and are described without use of the personal pronoun “I”, cf., e.g., [[MA190]] at T I 737a18: and .
10 [[MA190]] at T I 737a13: and the Tibetan version in Skilling 1994a: 152,7: dgon par ’du shes

11 [[MN121]] at MN III 104,17: bhikkhusa�gha� pa�icca ekatta�, directly followed in the next line at MN III
104,18 by araññasañña� pa�icca manasikaroti ekatta�. The perception of forest recurs in [[AN6.42]] at
AN III 343,9 (= [[AN8.86]] at AN IV 344,6) as a means to develop a unitary experience, ekatta. Vism 73,17
considers the same as a supportive condition for developing concentration.
12 While [[MN121]] at MN III 105,10 only takes up what should not be attended to in order to develop a uni- 我見是空
tary perception of earth, [[MA190]] at T 我見真實有 I 737a23 and the Tibetan version in Skilling 1994a: 156,9 also mention what should be attended 比丘 to, describing that the meditating monk gives attention to the aspect of sameness, similar to looking at the palm of a hand. 見是空 見真實有
13 This simile recurs in [[MA199]] at T I 760b 一無事想 28 to illustrate a particular torture administered to evildoers in
hell, where the tongue is stretched out and fixed by a hundred pegs, a punishment also described in Jā
541 at Jā VI 112,31; cf. also [[EA50.5]] at T II 810c27.

686   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


MN III 107  The Pāli version next takes up the attainment of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. This step is not found in the Chinese and the Tibetan versions (see table 13.1).


Table 13.1: Gradual Descent into Emptiness in [[MN121]] and its Parallels

The Cū�asuññata-sutta and its parallels agree in presenting the signless concentration
of the mind as the last step in this gradual series of perceptions. [15]

124 and adopt the reading adhimuccati found in B [e] -MN III 147,18, C [e] -MN III 264,21, and S [e] -MN III
227,1, instead of E [e] : vimuccati; cf. also above p. 194 note 263. An argument in favour of the reading vimuccati would be the expression vimocaya� citta� in [[MN118]] at MN III 83,10 which, since it is preceded by samādaha� citta�, clearly occurs in a context closely related to the development of concentration).
15 [[MA190]] at T I 737c3 actually speaks of “unconscious concentration of the mind”, . The notion
of a meditative experience that involves the absence of perception is reflected in the expression asa�j[ñ]isa(m)[ā]patti�, found in the otherwise unrelated fragment SHT IV 623 folio 40V6 (p. 256); cf. also
the asaññasamāpatti mentioned in Sp II 514,17. The reference in [[MA190]] to, however, points to
an equivalent to cetosamādhi instead of samāpatti. Moreover, since the Pāli and Tibetan parallels qualify the present experience as “signless”, cf. [[MN121]] at MN III 107,29: animitta and the Tibetan version
in Skilling 1994a: 172,5: mtshan ma med pa (though the Tibetan version differs in as much as it speaks
of the signless “element” or “sphere”, dbyings, instead of the signless “concentration of the mind”), it
seems that in the present case the character, “perception”, should be corrected to, “sign”, resulting
in what is the standard rendering of the signless concentration of the mind as ; for other cases
where and appear to have been confused with each other cf. above p. 274 note 54. The main point 無想心定
in developing such a “signless” form of meditation appears to be not to allow attention to be concerned
with any “sign”, cf., e.g., [[MN43]] at MN I 296,33. A “sign” in such contexts refers to those aspects, marks,
and characteristics by which one recognizes phenomena. Several Pāli discourses relate meditation on 心定
signlessness to the path to liberation or to liberation itself. Thus [[MN43]] at MN I 298,22 and [[SN41.7]] at
SN IV 297,25 speak of unsurpassable liberation of the mind, akuppa cetovimutti, as the highest of all
signless experiences. According to [[SN43.4]] at SN IV 360,16 and [[SN43.12]] at SN IV 363,12, animitta
samādhi constitutes a path that leads to the asa�khata. [[AN3.163]] at AN I 299,14 relates animitta samādhi to the removal of rāga, dosa, and moha 想 . [[AN7.53]] at AN IV 78,19 takes up a monk who dwells in 相
signlessness, animittavihārin, in the context of a discussion of various noble disciples. To be able to 無相心定
practise signless concentration of the mind does, however, not necessarily imply a high level of reali- 想 相
zation, since [[AN6.60]] at AN III 397,11 describes the case of a monk who, priding himself on having
attained signless meditative experiences, neglects seclusion and excessively associates with others, as a
result of which lust invades his mind and he finally disrobes. An additional perspective on signlessness
can be found in a discourse in the Sa�yukta-āgama, according to which it is not possible to develop


Chapter 13 Suññata-vagga                                      -  687


The three versions direct insightful contemplation to the conditioned and mentally MN III 108
fabricated nature of such signless concentration. While the Pāli discourse instructs to
contemplate this experience as impermanent and subject to cessation, [16] the Chinese and
Tibetan accounts recommend avoiding delight in relation to this attainment. [17]
The Pāli discourse stands alone in taking up the signless concentration of the mind
twice (see above table 13.1). The Chinese and the Tibetan versions mention signless
concentration only once and then continue directly with the insightful contemplation to
be undertaken in regard to this experience.
The Pāli version also speaks twice of the only “disturbance” that remains at this stage,
which is the continuity of the six sense-spheres conditioned by the life faculty. [18] The
Chinese and Tibetan versions speak of the six sense-spheres and the life faculty only
once, as part of the retrospective knowledge after the influxes have been eradicated. [19]


signlessness (in its ultimate sense) without at first developing concentration on emptiness, cf. [[SA80]] at T
II 20b4: “having attained emptiness, it is possible to develop signlessness”,, a statement [[SA80]] precedes by explaining that without having attained emptiness, to develop signlessness is
not possible. For a discussion of the relationship between śūnyatā and animitta cf. also SHT V 1131 V45 (p. 126). These various passages make it clear why signless concentration of the mind comes as the
climax of the gradual development of emptiness described in [[MN121]] and its parallels. For a detailed
study of different occurrences of animitta in the Pāli discourses and commentaries cf. Harvey 1986.
16 [[MN121]] at MN III 108,17: “this is impermanent and subject to cessation”, tad anicca� nirodhadhamman ti.
17 [[MA190]] at T I 737c11 describes the reflection like this: “I do not delight in this, do not seek this, it is not
suitable [for me] to be established on this”, . According to the Tibetan version in Skilling 1994a: 174,7: “it is not suitable to delight in it, to approve of it, to become attached to it, 得空已, 能起無相
or to remain attached to it” (my translation), de la ni mngon par dga’ bar bya ba ’am, mngon par brjod
par bya ba ’am, lhag par chags par bya ba ’am, lhag par chags shing gnas par bya bar mi rigs so. Schmithausen 1981: 236 note 136 suggests that mngon par brjod pa could be a mistaking of abhila�itu� for
abhilapitu�. Although mngong par brjod pa is indeed the standard rendering of abhilapanatā, cf. eg.
BHSD: 56 s.v. and entry no. 2795 in the Mahāvyutpatti, Sakaki 1926: 201 (for a discussion of abhilapanatā cf. also Cox 1992/1993: 79-82 and Gethin 1992a: 39-40), in the present context an alternative
way of understanding mngong par brjod pa might be that it renders abhivaditu�, found as part of a similar sequence of verbs, e.g., in [[MN106]] at MN II 263,7: abhinanditu� ... abhivaditu� ... ajjhositu�, or
else in [[MN38]] at MN I 266,29: abhinandati abhivadati ajjhosāya ti��hati 我不樂彼, 不求彼, 不應住彼 . A Sanskrit fragment version of
this verb series in SHT III 865V4-5 (p. 114), however, does not include abhivaditu�, as it only reads
(a)[bh](i)n(a�)ditu� vā adhyavasitu� vā adhyava(sāya) vā sthātu�.
18 [[MN121]] thereby no longer conforms to its own pattern of overcoming a particular “disturbance” with
each of the successive steps. Schmithausen 1981: 237 comments that “this appears strange in a text which
up to this point had strictly followed a pattern of ... progressive spiritual stages. In such a framework, the
two final sections give the impression of being ... a juxtaposition of an original and a revised version of
the final portion”.
19 [[MA190]] at T I 737c15 and Skilling 1994a: 176,11, corresponding to the second occurrence of the six
sense-spheres and the life faculty in [[MN121]] at MN III 108,26; on the instruction regarding the six sensespheres cf. also Tanto 2004. Here the Chinese and Tibetan versions offer a more straightforward perspective, since to speak of the six sense-spheres as the only disturbance left makes sense in relation to
retrospective knowledge of the destruction of the influxes. Once the influxes are destroyed, sensory experience is indeed the only disturbance left (Ps IV 154,1 explains that the reference to the six sense

688   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


According to all versions, insight contemplation undertaken in regard to the signless
concentration of the mind leads to the destruction of the influxes, which the Pāli and
the Tibetan discourses qualify as an unsurpassable manifestation of emptiness. [20]

MN III 109  The Pāli version refers to recluses and Brahmins in past, present, or future times who
dwell in this type of pure and supreme emptiness, while its two parallels speak of
Tathāgatas of the past, present, and future. [21] The three versions conclude with the Buddha encouraging Ānanda to put this gradual approach to emptiness into practice. [22]


[[MN122]] Mahāsuññata-sutta [23]

The Mahāsuññata-sutta, the “greater discourse on emptiness”, takes up the topic of
emptiness from a variety of perspectives. This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama and a parallel preserved in Tibetan. [24]


spheres stands for “what is related to the six sense-spheres”, sa�āyatanapa�isa�yutta�, i.e., experiences
through the six senses), standing representative for the subtlest degree of dukkha recognized in early
Buddhism, the unsatisfactoriness of all that is conditioned, cf., e.g., [[DN33]] at DN III 216,22 and its
parallel [[DA9]] at T I 50b12 (on the three types of dukkha cf. also Schmithausen 1977; on a Jain counterpart to sa�khāradukkhatā cf. Jaini 1977/2001). The same qualification does, however, not fit signless
concentration of the mind, which by its very absence of signs would be aloof from sensory experience.

21 [[MN121]] at MN III 109,2, [[MA190]] at T I 737c21, and Skilling 1994a: 178,10. The Chinese and Tibetan
versions of this statement fit the context well, since the discourse as a whole is a detailed exposition of
the Buddha’s statement that he often dwelled in emptiness. In view of this, it would be natural for the
discourse to conclude by referring to the dwelling in emptiness of a Tathāgata, an expression used regularly to refer to the Buddha, but which in a more general sense can also include all arahants, cf., e.g.,
[[MN22]] at MN I 140,5, [[SN54.12]] at SN V 327,8, or [[SNP3.4]] at [[SNP467-477]] Ps IV 154,16 takes that the expression “recluses and Brahmins”, used in [[MN121]] for those who dwell in emptiness, to intend only
Buddhas and their disciples in the present context. In fact, as according [[MN11]] at MN I 66,3, [[MA103]] at T
I 591a20, and [[EA27.2]] at T II 644a16 heterodox recluses and Brahmins did not really understand the
problem posed by clinging to a doctrine of self, one would not expect [[MN121]] to propose that these
same heterodox recluses and Brahmins were able to dwell in supreme emptiness.
22 [[MN121]] at MN III 109,13, [[MA190]] at T II 737c29, and Skilling 1994a: 180,5. Skilling 1997a: 358 notes
that while [[MN121]] and the Tibetan version report only that Ānanda rejoiced in the discourse, [[MA190]] at
T I 738a1 adds that other monks also rejoiced in the Buddha’s exposition. Such variations are found frequently between parallel versions of the same discourse, e.g., [[MN122]] at MN III 118,6 reports only that
Ānanda rejoiced, while its parallel [[MA191]] at T I 740c1 reports that Ānanda and the monks rejoiced, and
the Tibetan counterpart in Skilling 1994a: 262,4 mentions only the monks. It appears to be a stylistic device in the early discourses that by mentioning the most important member of a group, anyone else who
may be present is implicitly included. Thus by naming Ānanda, presumably anyone else present is also
taken into account. In the case of [[MN121]] this is self-evident, as unless other monks had been present, it
would have been impossible to direct Ānanda’s awareness to the community of monks as a first step in
the meditative development of emptiness; cf. also above p. 66, p. 474 note 169 and p. 618 note 161.
23 Skilling 1997a: 368 draws attention to an alternative title given in the commentary, Ps IV 157,13, which
speaks of the discourse on ‘breaking up the crowd’, ga�abhedana� nāma ida� sutta�, a title that takes
up the present discourse’s emphasis on the importance of avoiding excessive socializing.


Chapter 13 Suññata-vagga                                      -  689


The Mahāsuññata-sutta and its Chinese and Tibetan parallels begin by describing
how the Buddha chanced upon a number of resting places prepared for monks. [25] The
commentary explains that this was the first time the Buddha had come across such a
large group of monks living together in the same place. [26]
According to all versions, Ānanda explained to the Buddha that the monks had come
together to make robes. [27] The Tibetan version provides the additional indication that
the seats or mats had been left outside in the open. [28]
This could be a sign of heedlessness, since according to the monastic rules the monks
should have stored those mats away. [29] This additional detail in the Tibetan version

24 The parallels are [[MA191]] at T I 738a-740c and the mdo chen po stong pa nyid chen po zhes bya ba,
translated by Jinamitra, Prajñāvarman, and Ye shes sde, D (291) or Q (957), edited in Skilling 1994a:

cf. also Choong 1999: 79-84. [[MA191]] and the Tibetan version agree with [[MN122]] on the location. [[MA191]] also agrees with [[MN122]] on the title ( ). The title of the Tibetan version would correspond to
Mahāśūnyatā-nāma-mahāsūtra and thus applies the qualification “great” to “emptiness” and to the “discourse”. The qualification “great discourse”, mahāsūtra, is something the Tibetan parallel to [[MN122]]
has in common with the Tibetan parallel to [[MN121]] and a number of other selected discourses, so that
only the qualification of emptiness as “great” is specific to the present instance. Thus, the Tibetan parallel to [[MN121]] takes up “emptiness”, while the parallel to [[MN122]] is on “great emptiness”. Abhidh-k
4:60 in Pradhan 1967: 235,17 similarly refers to the present discourse as a treatment of “great emptiness”,
mahatyā� śūnyatāyām. Regarding the relationship between [[MN121]] and [[MN122]] Choong 1999: 83
makes the pertinent observation that in [[MN121]] “the practice proceeds vertically, step by step ... through
the fading away of ... perceptions in the process of practising emptiness” up to the culmination point of
emptiness with the destruction of the influxes. [[MN122]] however, 大空經 “proceeds horizontally from inner to
outer”, as it progresses from the meditative abiding in emptiness to various practices related to this abiding. Skilling 1997a: 14 and 369 notes that the Tibetan version would have belonged to a (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Madhyama-āgama collection. Wille 2004: 146 note 5 mentions a Sanskrit fragment from the
British Library collection as a possible parallel to [[MN122]] at MN III 114. For a discourse quotation in
Abhidh-k-� cf. below note 60.
25 [[MN122]] at MN III 110,3 stands alone in describing that, on seeing these resting places, the Buddha reflected: “are many monks living here”, sambahulā nu kho idha bhikkhū viharantī ti?
26 Ps IV 155,18: “previously the Blessed One had not seen ten or twelve monks living together in one place”,
ito kira pubbe bhagavatā dasa dvādasa bhikkhū eka��hāne vasantā na di��hapubbā.
27 While [[MN122]] at MN III 110,9 simply describes that the Buddha sat down on a prepared seat, the Chinese and Tibetan versions depict Ānanda’s reception of the Buddha with additional detail. According to
[[MA191]] at T I 738a12, when Ānanda saw the Buddha approaching he took the Buddha’s bowl and robe,
set out a seat, and brought water for washing the Buddha’s feet. According to the Tibetan version in
Skilling 1994a: 192,6, Ānanda arranged a seat for the Buddha and welcomed the Buddha, inviting him
to sit down.
28 Skilling 1994a: 190,9: “outside of the dwelling place many mats had been laid out” (my translation),

receives support from the Pāli commentary, which reports Ānanda thinking that the
Buddha must have seen that the monks had not put away their bedding and was going
to rebuke them for it. [30]
The three versions agree that the Buddha expressed his disapproval of excessive socializing, explaining that a monk who delights in company will be unable to easily experience the happiness of renunciation, seclusion, peace, and awakening, [31] and will also
be unable to reach temporary or perpetual liberation of the mind. [32]

MN III 111  According to all versions, the Buddha explained that to delight in any manifestation
of material form inevitably leads to dukkha, since material form is impermanent.
Next the Buddha described his own dwelling in emptiness, which the Pāli version describes as a dwelling in emptiness internally by not giving attention to any sign. [33]
According to the Chinese and Tibetan versions, however, the Buddha’s own practice
was rather a dwelling in external emptiness after overcoming perceptions of form. [34]


30 Ps IV 157,27: “surely those monks have not set their bedding in order and the Blessed One would have
seen it. Being displeased with this, the teacher well wishes to admonish them”, a��hā etehi bhikkhūhi

31 [[MA191]] at T I 738a23 adds to this the “noble happiness”,, the “non-carnal happiness”,
(nirāmisa), and the “happiness [beyond] birth and death”, . The “noble happiness” recurs also
in the Tibetan version in Skilling 1994a: 196,3: ’phags pa’i bde ba. It is perhaps also noteworthy that
[[MA191]] at T I 738a24 refers to the nekkhammasukha found in [[MN122]] at MN III 110,20 as,
literally “happiness of no desire” (cf. also [[MA102]] at T I 589a15, which has, “thought of no desire”, as a counterpart to the expression nekkhammavitakka found in its parallel [[MN19]] at MN I 114,28),
whereas the Tibetan version in Skilling 1994a: 196,3 speaks of “going forth happiness” (my translation),

by overcoming all perceptions of material form stands for going beyond the five types of sense pleasure.
This explanation does not seem to be applicable to the present context, since perceptions related to the

The Pāli commentary explains that the reference to the Buddha’s abiding in emptiness internally intends his fruition attainment. [35] The fruition attainment of an arahant
takes Nirvā�a as its object and would indeed be an experience devoid of any signs.
In contrast, the need to overcome perceptions of material form, mentioned in the Chinese and Tibetan versions, recurs regularly in other discourses as the starting point for
attaining the sphere of boundless space. The close relationship between overcoming
perceptions of form and the attainment of boundless space is of such regularity in the
discourses as to make it quite probable that the same attainment is meant in the present
context. [36] The sphere of boundless space could indeed be reckoned as a dwelling in
“external” emptiness, as such experience of all-pervading space is devoid of any material objects. [37]
Yet, the Cū�asuññata-sutta and its parallels consider the sphere of boundless space as
only an intermediate step in their gradual approach to emptiness, [38] a gradual approach
that in all three versions leads up to the development of signlessness. [39] This suggests
signless meditation to be superior to attaining the sphere of boundless space.
The Chinese and Tibetan parallels to the Mahāsuññata-sutta continue by indicating
that abiding in the attainment reached after overcoming perceptions of form will lead


five types of sense pleasure are already left behind with the first jhāna, whereas in the present context
the problem seems to be that despite jhāna attainment the monk is not able to successfully direct the
mind to emptiness.

I am not aware of a Pāli discourse where the formulaic expression about overcoming all perceptions of form, sabbaso rūpasaññā�a� samatikkamā, does
not introduce the sphere of boundless space. The same is the case in the Madhyama-āgama, where except for the present occurrence in [[MA191]] at T I 738b14, all other occurrences of the formulaic expression on overcoming all perceptions of form,, introduce the sphere of boundless space, cf.
[[MA86]] at T I 563b23, [[MA91]] at T I 573c2, [[MA97]] at T I 581b20, [[MA163]] at T I 694b1, [[MA164]] at T I

800b12, [[MA217]] at T I 802b26, and [[MA219]] at T I 803b22. The same formulation recurs also as the
introduction to the sphere of boundless space in the Daśottara-sūtra fragment [[SN473]] folio 17V2-3 in
Mittal 1957: 48, cf. also Pauly 1957: 292, and in the Mahāvyutpatti no. 1514 in Sakaki 1926: 117; for
further references cf. Deleanu 2006b: 546 note 208.
37 The attainment of boundless space does not necessarily imply any level of realization of emptiness, however, in fact, the Brahmajāla-sutta and its parallels indicate that the attainment of the sphere of boundless space could also lead to the arising of annihilationist views, cf.

to the arising of joy, rapture, tranquillity, happiness, and concentration. [40] This passage
thus depicts mental experiences that only lead up to the development of concentration.
Feelings of joy and happiness, in particular, are long left behind when the sphere of
boundless space is attained, as such feelings are experienced only during the lower jhānas. Considered from this perspective, the present reference to overcoming perceptions
of form in the Chinese and Tibetan versions would even fall short of being the attainment of boundless space.
In sum, the Chinese and Tibetan versions’ reference to overcoming perceptions of
form and experiencing joy and happiness combines an instruction usually related to the
attainment of the first immaterial sphere with a state of mind that would correspond to
the first or second jhāna. The two specifications are difficult to reconcile with each
other and neither of them fits the present context, where the point at stake is a meditative dwelling “realized” by the Buddha. [41] From this perspective, only the Pāli version’s
reference to leaving behind all signs would fit a meditation that could indeed be reckoned as a personal discovery of the Buddha.
The reference to overcoming perceptions of form in the Chinese and Tibetan version
could be the result of a reciter’s error, perhaps caused by the reference to form in the
immediately preceding statement of the Buddha, which explains that to delight in any
manifestation of material form inevitably leads to dukkha.
The three versions next take up the Buddha’s attitude towards visitors, [42] explaining
that he would instruct them with a mind that inclines to seclusion. [43]

tranquillity arises, happiness arises, concentration arises”,

supreme joy ... rapture, tranquillity, happiness and concentration” (my translation), nga gnas pa ’dis gnas

teachers, and their disciples.
43 According to [[MN122]] at MN III 111,16, the Buddha would deliver uyyojaniyapa�isa�yutta� yeva katha� (B [e] -MN III 153,14, C [e] -MN III 274,11, and S [e] -MN III 235, 我行此住處已, 8: uyyojanikapa�isa�yutta� 生歡悅 ... 生喜, 生止, ). Chalmers 生樂,
1927: 218 renders this as 生定 “he frames his speech so as to be left alone once more”, Horner 1959: 154 as
“[he] speaks there as one intent only on inspiring them”, and Ñā�amoli 1995/2005: 972 as “he invariably talks to them in a way concerned with dismissing them”; cf. also the commentarial gloss at Ps IV
160,18, according to which dismissal is meant, uyyojanikapa�isa�yuttan ti gacchatha tumhe ti eva� uyyojanikena vacanena pa�isa�yutta�. The expression itself is ambiguous, as uyyojeti 我 ... can mean 正覺盡覺 “to dismiss” and to “send away”, but also “to instigate” and “to urge”, cf. CPD II: 547 s.v. uyyojeti, DP: 508
s.v. uyyojana, and PED: 155 s.v. uyyojeti. Examples where the sense of dismissal fits the context are
Vin IV 92,32, where a monk sends another monk away, or Vin IV 94,32, where a layman asks a monk to
leave. Horner 1959: 154 note 8 draws attention to the expression uyyojanikapa�isa�yutta� yeva katha�
in [[AN8.30]] at AN IV 233,33, where the commentary offers a different gloss, explaining that uyyojanikapa�isa�yuttā kathā stands for talk that is going to be of support for the listeners, Mp IV 122,2: tesa�

The Pāli and Chinese versions continue by describing how a monk gives attention to MN III 112
emptiness internally, externally, and internally-and-externally. [44] The Tibetan version
differs in so far as it begins with the external, followed by the internal, before coming
to the external-and-internal. [45] The sequence from internal via external to internal-andexternal is standard not only in the Pāli discourses, [46] but also in the Chinese Āgamas, [47]
hence it is unusual for the Tibetan version to adopt a different sequence.
The three versions precede this topic by taking up the need to develop concentration
as a basis for dwelling in emptiness. While the Pāli version lists the four jhānas as a
way of settling and stabilizing the mind internally, the Chinese and Tibetan versions
refer only to the first jhāna. [48]
The Mahāsuññata-sutta and its parallels describe in similar ways that, after being unsuccessful in giving attention to emptiness internally, or externally, or internally-andexternally, the meditating monk is also unsuccessful in giving attention to imperturbability. According to the Pāli commentary, “imperturbability” here refers to the immaterial attainments. [49]


ing”, finds support in the Chinese and Tibetan parallels to [[MN122]] as according to [[MA191]] at T I 738b20
on such occasions the Buddha would “speak Dharma to advise and help” his visitors,, and according to the Tibetan version in Skilling 1994a: 202,8 the Buddha would “exchange pleasant words”
with his visitors and “proceed to give them a discourse on the Dharma” (my translation), phan tshun kun
dga’ bar gtam ’dre bar smra, phebs par smra zhing chos kyi gtam yang zer ro. Horner 1959: 155 note 8
remarks that for the Buddha to talk to others with the intention of dismissing them could seem “a certain
selfishness” on his part. The commentary at Ps IV 160,20, however, explains that such dismissal would
only take place when something else needed to be done at the time after the meal or at the time of the
first watch of the night (the period usually allotted to meditation practice), pacchābhattakiccavelāya vā

694   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


The Chinese and Tibetan versions indicate that the problem when giving attention to
internal, external, and internal-and-external emptiness was that the mind had been
“perturbed”. [50] This suggests that the attempt to develop emptiness in these different
modes led to a loss of the level of concentration reached earlier. From this it would
follow that the basis for developing the emptiness contemplations was indeed the
fourth jhāna, as suggested by the Pāli version, a level of concentration with which
mental stability becomes “imperturbable”. [51]
The three versions agree that, once the basis of concentration has been stabilized again,
the monk will be able to develop emptiness meditation. In regard to this and subsequent
stages of the meditative development of emptiness, the parallel versions mention the
presence of clear comprehension as a characteristic aspect of this way of practice. [52]
The Mahāsuññata-sutta and its parallels continue by explaining that emptiness can
be developed during walking and sitting. While the presentation in the Chinese and
Tibetan versions describes formal meditation practice in the sitting and walking posture and thus only mentions these two postures, [53] the Pāli version adds standing and
lying down, thereby covering all four postures. [54] The parallel versions agree that one
who dwells in emptiness in this way will stay aloof from covetousness and dejection
while being in any of these postures. [55]


ing to which imperturbability in the present context refers to developing perception of impermanence
and perception of du�kha.

51 To attain the fourth jhāna is equivalent to having “reached imperturbability”, āneñjappatte (cf., e.g., [[MN4]] at MN I 22,10), a condition which then enables the development of the immaterial attainments. If the
meditating monk had earlier only developed concentration up to the level of the first jhāna, it would not
make sense for him to try to give attention to imperturbability at a junction of his practice where his earlier attempts to develop emptiness had failed. The point of the present passage in [[MN122]] rather seems
to be that, in order to prepare himself for another attempt at meditating on emptiness, the monk at first
has to re-establish the level of concentration he had earlier developed, but which during his attempts to
develop emptiness meditation had become ‘perturbed’.
52 [[MN122]] at MN III 112,14+30 心移動 : itiha tattha sampājano hoti, [[MA191]] at T I 738c27 and T I 739a3+7+12:

the Tibetan version combines with the presence of mindfulness, dran pa. [[MN122]] mentions clear comprehension already in regard to the earlier attempts to give attention to emptiness and imperturbability.
53 The Chinese and Tibetan versions describe how a monk who intends to do walking meditation will get
up and leave the place where he had been seated in meditation to go outside, [[MA191]] at T I 739a13:
and Skilling 1994a: 222,1: dge slong des gtsug lag khang gi phyi
rol bla gab med pa’i ’chag sar. These two versions continue by describing walking meditation in terms
similar to [[AN7.58]] at AN IV 87,2, where it forms a method to overcome drowsiness. The Chinese and
Tibetan discourses then describe how, once the monk wishes to sit again, he sits down cross-legged in
meditation, [[MA191]] at T I 739a17: and Skilling 1994a: 224,4: skyil mo krung

According to the Pāli presentation, one who dwells in emptiness will refrain from unsuitable topics of conversation and will avoid the three unwholesome thoughts. [56] The
Chinese and Tibetan versions present the same two issues in a similar way, although in
the opposite order. As the general pattern in this part of the discourse is to move from
formal meditation to less formal activities, the Chinese and Tibetan versions’ progression from thoughts to conversation would fit this pattern better.
The three versions next take up the five types of sensual pleasure. [57] While the Pāli
version only indicates that a monk who is still attracted to these five types of sensual
pleasure should know that he has not yet overcome desire, the Chinese and Tibetan
versions also explain what should be done in order to go beyond such desire. For this
purpose, the monk should contemplate sensual pleasures in terms of impermanence,
decay, dispassion, cessation, and release. [58]
The Mahāsuññata-sutta and its parallels next turn to the five aggregates, instructing
to contemplate their arising and passing away in order to go beyond the conceit ‘I am’.
The Tibetan version introduces these instructions by describing how the meditating
monk at first examines himself to see if he has conceit, desire, or any underlying tendency towards ‘I am’ in regard to these five aggregates. [59]


ties, thereby making it clear that what follows is an outcome of dwelling in emptiness and at the same
time an integral part of its practice, [[MN122]] at MN III 112,31: iminā vihārena viharato, [[MA191]] at T I
739a12:, and the Tibetan version in Skilling 1994a: 220,14: de gnas pa ’dis gnas pa
na. Ñā�amoli 1982: 2 notes that Ps I 92,32 refers to the present discourse “as one of the ‘pa�ipadā’ suttas ... discourses ... which would be adopted by a bhikkhu as a guide in the particular mode of practice
(pa�ipadā)”, a practice of which the presently described activities are obviously an integral part. Another
point worthy of note is that the reference in [[MN122]] at MN III 112,34 to the absence of covetousness
and dejection, nābhijjhā domanassā pāpakā akusalā dhammā anvāssavissantī ti, and to the presence of
clear comprehension, iti ha tattha sampajāno hoti, recurs in a description of sense-restraint in [[AN8.9]] at
AN IV 167,4. Judging from this parallelism, to maintain one’s dwelling in emptiness would require the
successful implementation of sense-restraint during various activities.
56 [[MN122]] at MN III 113,15 and MN III 114,2 explains that unsuitable conversation and unwholesome
thoughts are avoided because 彼比丘 行此住處 “it/they does/do not lead to disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, peace,
direct knowledge, awakening, and Nirvā�a”, na nibbidāya na virāgāya na nirodhāya na upasamāya na
abhiññāya na sambodhāya na nibbānāya sa�vattati/sa�vattanti, a point not made in the parallels.
57 The Tibetan version in Skilling 1994a: 232 does not have the detailed examination of the five types of
sensual pleasure according to each sense-door, given in the other versions. The Tibetan discourse in
Skilling 1994a: 232,5 also changes from having as its subject a monk, dge slong, to the noble disciple,
’phags pa nyan thos pa, a change not made in [[MN122]] or [[MA191]] In its examination of the five types
of sense pleasure, the Tibetan version in Skilling 1994a: 234,3+6+10 reverts to the monk, dge slong, an
inconsistency which suggests that the change to the noble disciple found at the outset of this passage
and again at the outset of the subsequent passage on the five aggregates could be a textual error.

The three versions conclude that all these phenomena are entirely outside of the reach
of Māra. [60] The Pāli commentary explains that the expression ‘phenomena’ refers to the
series of practices described up to this point. [61] The Madhyama-āgama version points
out that all these phenomena have their root in diligence. [62] It continues with the Buddha explaining that all Tathāgatas reached unsurpassable awakening through diligence,
followed by instructing Ānanda that he should also train himself in diligence. As the
next topic in all versions is the proper conduct of a disciple, the Madhyama-āgama version’s presentation provides a smooth transition from the meditation practices covered
so far to the topic of the type of conduct that is appropriate for a disciple of the Buddha.

MN III 115  The Pāli version introduces this topic with the image of a disciple who follows the
teacher even when the teacher sends him away. [63] While the Tibetan version proceeds
similar to the Pāli account, [64] the Chinese discourse does not envisage the possibility
that a disciple would follow the Buddha even when being sent away, speaking only of
a faithful disciple who follows the Buddha and acts respectfully until the end of his life. [65]
The Madhyama-āgama version then describes how a disciple might follow the teacher
for the sake of discourses, verses-with-prose, and explanations. [66] This statement thus
takes up the first three of the nine or twelve a�gas, listed regularly in early Buddhist


pa’i bag la nyal ma spangs shing; cf. also D (4094) mngon pa, ju 235b6 or Q (5595) tu 269a6 which,
although differently worded, has the same reference to desire and an underlying tendency. The Tibetan
version thus stands alone in speaking of “desire” and “underlying tendency”, in addition to the “conceit”
found also in [[MN122]] and [[MA191]] The Pāli commentary, Ps IV 163,14, in its gloss on the present passage similarly speaks of asmī ti māno, asmī ti chando, asmī ti anusayo. Skilling 1997a: 390 notes that
the same threefold presentation recurs in [[SN22.89]] at SN III 130,29 (where this pattern is found similarly in the parallel version [[SA103]] at T II 30a24:,, ).
60 A discourse quotation paralleling the reference to entirely wholesome things that are beyond Māra in [[MN122]] at MN III 115,8 can be found in Abhidh-k 4:60 in Pradhan 1967: 235,17, cf. also T 1558 at T XXIX

in S [e] -MN III 241,10, while B [e] -MN III 156,27 reads 我慢 pa�ujjamāno 我欲 我使 )? The expression panujjamāna occurs
in a similar context in [[MN17]] at MN I 108,9, where the commentary Ps II 72,26 suggests it to stand for
being “thrown out”, api panujjamānenā pī ti api nikka��hīyamānenā pi. The two Madhyama-āgama
parallels to [[MN17]] [[MA107]] at T I 597c8 and [[MA108]] at T I 598b3, do not have such an expression.

65 [[MA191]] at T I 739b28: 不放逸 ? In fact, once the Buddha sends a disciple away, one would expect that the disciple follows such an order. This is indeed the case in the Cātumā-sutta and its parallels, where a whole group of disciples are sent away by the Buddha and only
dare to come back after others have intervened on their behalf, cf. [[MN67]] at MN I 457,10 and its parallels [[EA45.2]] at T II 770c23 and T 137 at T II 860b3.

discourse. The Pāli editions show some variations in their formulation of this passage,
as a result of which their listings could refer to two or three out of these a�gas. [67] The
Tibetan version lists the whole set of twelve a�gas. [68]
The reference in the Chinese parallel to the Mahāsuññata-sutta to the first three types
of a�gas – discourse, verses-with-prose, and explanations – has been taken by some
scholars as reflecting an early stage in the evolution of this particular listing of canonical texts. [69]

sutta� geyya� veyyākara�a� tassa hetu, and S [e] -MN III 241,15 reads sutta-geyya-veyyākara�assa sotu�. Chalmers 1927: 220 renders this as “for the interpretation of canonical scriptures”, Horner 1959:
159 as: “for the sake of an exposition of the discourses that are in prose and in prose and verse”, and in
note 3 remarks that “of the nine divisions ... only the first two are mentioned here, sutta and geyya”, Ñā�amoli 1982: 11 similarly translates: “for the sake of expositions of discourses and stanzas”.

69 Yìnshùn 1971/1983: 788 considers the three a�gas of discourse, verses, and exposition,
, to be the earliest organizing principle in the evolution of the early Buddhist canon. Choong 2010:
56-57 explains that according to this hypothesis these three a�gas underlie the structure of the Sa�yukta-āgama, considered to be “the foundation of all four āgamas (nikāyas) in the formation of early Buddhist texts”, which then “subsequently expanded and yielded the other āgamas in the sequence Madhyama-āgama, Dīrgha-āgama, Ekottarika-āgama. Therefore, the ... SA [Sa�yukta-āgama] is the foundation of all four āgamas”, in contrast to “the secondary nature of [the] Madhyamāgama/Majjhima-nikāya,
Dīrghāgama/Dīgha-nikāya, and Ekottarikāgama/A�guttara-nikāya”. This hypothesis is based on the description of the Āgamas given in the Vastusa�graha�ī of the Yogācārabhūmi. Although the indications
made in the Vastusa�graha�ī have indubitably been of great importance for reconstructing the order of
the Sa�yukta-āgama (T 99), which in the Taishō edition is in disarray (cf. also Bucknell 2006: 685), 修多羅, 祇夜,
記說 from a methodological viewpoint it would not be possible to use the reconstructed Sa�yukta-āgama in
turn to prove that the indications given in the Vastusa�graha�ī are correct, since this would become a
circular argument. Besides, it is also not clear if the description of the Āgamas in the Vastusa�graha�ī
has to be read as positing the Sa�yukta-āgama as a kind of ‘Urkanon’ in its own right. It might just intend to explain why the Sa�yukta-āgama is given pride of place in its listings of the four Āgamas. In the
corresponding passage in the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, T 1451 at T XXIV 407b27, cf. also Lévi 1916:
36, the point at stake does in fact not seem to be a temporal priority of the formation of the Sa�yuktaāgama, but only a temporal priority of it being recited by Ānanda at the so-called first council, before he
recited the other Āgamas. Although the idea that the early Buddhist oral transmission began by assembling discourses according to topics in a manner similar to what is not found in the Sa�yukta-āgama
and the Sa�yutta-nikāya is certainly appealing, there seems to be no reason why a numerical organisation could not have been in use as well, similar to what underlies the Ekottarika-āgama and the A�guttara-nikāya. The introduction to the Ekottarika-āgama in fact emphasizes this numerical arrangement, T II 550b24, and hence gives pride of place among the four collections to the Ekottarika-āgama,
with the Sa�yukta-āgama relegated to the last position in its list, cf. T II 549c29 (other listings that place
the Ekottarika-āgama in first position and the Sa�yukta-āgama last can be found, e.g., in the (presumably) Haimavata Vinaya, T 1463 at T XXIV 820a23, the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-(upadeśa-)śāstra, T 1509
at T XXV 69c5, and the, T 1634 at T XXXII 36c15; for still other listings cf. below p. 864
入大乘論


698   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


Yet, in view of the variations among the Pāli editions of the Mahāsuññata-sutta, such
a conclusion seems uncertain. A discourse in the A�guttara-nikāya presents still another variation, as in addition to discourses, verses-with-prose, and explanations it also
mentions marvellous events, abbhutadhamma, thereby covering four out of the standard listing of nine a�gas. [70]


note 46). Perhaps more than one organizing principle was in use from the outset, since otherwise it
would be difficult to explain what happened to those discourses that do not neatly fit into the topic-wise
arrangement now found in the Sa�yukta-āgama/Sa�yutta-nikāya. It seems improbable that these were
just left to float around without being in any way organized at a time when other discourses were formally assembled according to topic. Alternatively, all such discourses must be considered to be of later
origin, resulting in a presumption about the nature of earliest Buddhism that would be difficult to substantiate. The Sa�yukta-āgama (T 99) itself contains a number of passages and tales that in the Theravāda tradition are found only in commentarial literature. This makes it improbable that the Sa�yuktaāgama, at least in the form we have it now, should be assigned to a textual strata that is distinctively earlier than the other discourse collections (cf. also Choong 2010: 63, who notes that the discourse material
found in this collection does not “all actually belong to the teachings of Early Buddhism”). Regarding the
a�gas, the description of the Āgamas in the passage under discussion from the Vastusa�graha�ī does not
explicitly refer to the set of three a�gas. The only tri-partite analysis found in the present passage distinguishes the Sa�yukta-āgama discourses from the viewpoint of speaker, topic, and audience, T 1579 at T
XXX 772c17:,, and D (4039) sems tsam, zi 128a1 or Q (5540) ’i 143b6:
su ston pa dang, ci ston pa dang, gang la ston pa dang (cf. also Bucknell 2007: 19 and 32 note 78). This
division does not naturally evoke the three a�gas of sutta, geyya, and veyyākara�a (on the significance
of the last of these three cf. also Anālayo 2009l). In fact, had this been the original intention, the three
a�gas could have been directly mentioned. Another argument in support of the significance of the threefold listing is presented by Sujāto 2005: 62, who notes that in a reference to the twelve a�gas in a Mahāparinirvā�a-sūtra fragment, cf. [[SN362]] folio 173R6-7 in Waldschmidt 1950: 62, “the twelve a�gas
are listed with the first three members declined as individual words, while the remaining members occur
grouped together as one long compound”, which he takes to point to a special emphasis on the first three.
Although in the case of another Mahāparinirvā�a-sūtra version, fragment 1024R5 in Waldschmidt
1968: 5, the remainder of the listing does not form a compound: 一是能說 二是所說 三是所為說 sūtra� geya� vyākara�a� gāth-oddānā nidānāvadānā itiv�(ttkajātaka)v[ai]pulyādbhutadharmopa(deśās), Sujāto notes that in the Śrāvakabhūmi listings of the a�gas also follow the above pattern, cf., e.g., Shukla 1973: 100,18 or ŚSG
1998: 154,3. Yet, this form of presentation need not be interpreted as reflecting some underlying awareness of an ancient use of the three a�gas at the time of the formation of the canonical collections, otherwise forgotten. It could just be the result of a standard procedure in Buddhist texts, where the first three
members of listing are always mentioned, even when the rest is abbreviated (cf. also note 70 below).
This pattern can in fact be observed in the same Śrāvakabhūmi, cf., e.g., Shukla 1973: 101,20 or ŚSG
1998: 154,25: sūtra� geya� vyākara�am iti vistare�a pūrvavat, a formulation that could easily have
influenced the pattern noticed by Sujāto. In sum, it seems that the evidence brought forward so far in
support of a special significance of the three a�gas is not conclusive. Hence, the present passage in [[MA191]] (and presumably also in [[MN122]]) might, after all, be just the result of a transmission error.
70 [[AN5.194]] at AN III 237,17: yadi suttaso yadi geyyaso yadi veyyākara�aso yadi abbhutadhammaso. Von
Hinüber 1994a: 129 explores the possibility that this fourfold presentation may point to a beginning stage
of the list of nine a�gas, suggesting that sutta could refer to the Pātimokkha-sutta as the basis for the later
Vinayapi�aka (for a critical reply to this suggestion cf. Klaus 2010: 516-518), geyya could stand for the
verse, and veyyākara�a for the prose out of which later the Suttapi�aka developed, while abbhutadhamma could stand for the beginnings of the Buddha legend. Von Hinüber 1994a: 124 supports his assump

Chapter 13 Suññata-vagga                                      -  699


Thus, in spite of the sometimes ingenious hypotheses that scholars have developed
based on single instances of such shorter listings, [71] the possibility that these two instances of a three-fold and a four-fold listing could simply be accidents of oral transmission needs to be seriously taken into consideration.
When considered within its context, the present passage is in fact to some extent puzzling, since the discourse, verses-with-prose, and (their?) explanations, for whose sake
a disciple should not follow the teacher, are contrasted with beneficial types of talk for
whose sake he should follow the teacher. Such beneficial types of talk are in all versions explained to be talk on morality, concentration, wisdom, liberation, and knowledge-and-vision-of-liberation. [72] These topics would be the very topics that are covered
in the discourses, in the verses-with-prose, and in (their?) explanations, etc. In view of
this, one may wonder about the nature of the contrast between the texts for whose sake
the disciple should not follow the teacher and the topics for whose sake the disciple
should follow the teacher.
Thus, consideration of the context indicates that the present passage should have something more specific in mind than the whole corpus of early Buddhist canonical texts, independent of whether this corpus be presented as two-fold, three-fold, four-fold, ninefold, or twelve-fold. In other words, the original import of the present passage was probably not at all about a division of texts into a�gas.


tion that the nine-fold listing is later with the observation that whereas the listing sutta, geyya, veyyākara�a, abbhutadhamma follows the law of waxing syllables by having 2+2+5+5 syllables, the same is no
longer true for the nine-fold listing: sutta, geyya, veyyākara�a, gāthā, udāna, itivuttaka, jātaka, abbhutadhamma, vedalla, resulting in 2+2+5+2+3+5+3+5+3 syllables, an irregularity that can be a sign of a
later expansion of an earlier formula. However, in longer listings the principle of waxing syllables is
often applied to subunits only, cf. also above p. 15 note 102. The survey of a�ga listings in Mayeda 1964
shows that in a considerable number of instances of the nine-fold listing, the last term is adbhūtadharma; cf. also Choong 2010: 60. If the same sequence were to be applied to the Pāli listing, assuming that
perhaps the sequence got slightly jumbled during the process of transmission, then the Pāli listing of
nine a�gas would accord with the principle of waxing syllables by having three sub-groups: 2+2+5 syllables, 2+3+5 syllables, and 3+3+5 syllables. If this should indeed have been the original pattern, then
the reference to four a�gas in [[AN5.194]] could simply be the result of an intentional abbreviation, which
often mentions the first three and the last member of a listing, a tendency already noted by von Hinüber
1994a: 124.
71 In addition to the proposals discussed in the notes above, Mayeda 1964: 26 and 34 (cf. also Nakamura
1980/1999: 28) offers yet another hypothesis, according to which the starting point for the list of nine
(and later twelve) types of text could have been a fivefold listing that comprised sutta, geyya, veyyākara�a, gāthā, and udāna. Yet another listing can be found in the *Karmavibha�gopadeśa in Lévi 1932a:
161,8: sūtra� geya� vyākara�a� itiv�tta� gāthodānam, a listing which is clearly due to a loss of text,
as the *Karmavibha�gopadeśa continues by speaking of the nine types of canonical text, eva� navā�gaśāsana�. This evident instance of textual loss makes it stand to reason that a similar explanation
could also be applicable to the listings in [[MN122]] and [[AN5.194]]
72 [[MN122]] at MN III 115,25: sīlakathā, samādhikathā, paññākathā, vimuttikathā, vimuttiñā�adassanakathā, [[MA191]] at T I 739c8:, and the Tibetan version in Skilling 1994a: 244,13: tshul khrims kyi gtam dang, ting nge ’dzin gyi gtam dang, shes rab kyi gtam dang,

700   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


The Pāli commentators draw attention to a discourse found in the A�guttara-nikāya,
according to which knowledge of the discourses forms the basis for overcoming what
is unwholesome and developing what is wholesome. [73] This places the criticism levied
in the Mahāsuññata-sutta in proper perspective. The Pāli commentary explains that the
present passage only criticizes neglecting the practice for the sake of learning. [74]
From this perspective, then, the point of the present passage in the Mahāsuññata-sutta would simply be to depict a disciple who follows the teacher merely to receive ever
more explanations of the discourses, etc., for the sake of mere learning. In contrast to
such pursuits, a disciple should rather follow the teacher to receive just the type of talk
that acts as a guide and inspiration for his or her own progress on the path to liberation.
Such an admonition would in fact suit an injunction addressed to Ānanda quite well,
as in the early discourses he embodies the prototype of the learned disciple who has
heard much, but who at the same time has not yet developed the path to liberation to its
fullest potential.
In sum, it would fit the context best if the Mahāsuññata-sutta and its parallels were
to simply speak of following the teacher for the sake of getting ever more “explanations” (instead of engaging in serious practice), without bringing up any listing of a�gas, be it partial or complete. [75]
Such would also be in accordance with the general thrust of the discourse as a whole,
which appears to be a warning to Ānanda that he should not neglect practice in seclusion for the sake of making robes or, in the present context, for the sake of acquiring
more learning.
The three versions continue by examining three types of misfortune. The first of
these three is the misfortune of a teacher who dwells in seclusion but who then excessively associates with visitors, with the result that he backslides and unwholesome
states arise in him. [76]

73 [[AN7.63]] at AN IV 110,12: sutāvudho ... ariyasāvako akusala� pajahati, kusala� bhāveti.
74 Ps IV 164,13 explains that this instruction refers to a person who “has taken up the study of the discourses
and does not properly practise the path accordingly”, sutapariyatti� uggahetvā pi tad anucchavika� anulomapa�ipada� na pa�ipajjati.
75 In analogy with the reading found in the Ee and Se editions (cf. above p. 697 note 67), such an injunction
might have just read na ... arahati sāvako satthāra� anubandhitu� yadida� sutta� veyyākaranassa hetu or sutta-veyyākaranassa sotu�. The occurrence of sutta and veyyākarana could easily have led to an
accidental supplementation of the ‘missing’ part geyya during an early stage of the oral transmission of
the discourse, early enough to affect the MN and MĀ versions. Subsequently, the same tendency of supplementing what is presumed to be missing would then have resulted in the twelve-fold listing found
now in the Tibetan version.
76 [[MA191]] at T I 739c14 and the Tibetan version in Skilling 1994a: 246,10 introduce this teacher as someone given to reasoning and intellectual speculation, and rtog ge pa dpyod pa can. According to [[MA191]] at T I 739c18, while living in seclusion this teacher practised earnestly and reached the
higher mind, (corresponding to adhicitta), dwelling in happiness here and now
(corresponding to di��hadhammasukhavihāra), expressions which suggest that he had reached jhāna attainment. [[MA191]] at T I 739c26 and T I 740b6 applies the same qualifications also to the case of a disciple in general and to the case of the disciple of a Tathāgata.

The Mahāsuññata-sutta and its parallels apply the same to the case of a disciple in
general and to the case of a disciple of the Tathāgata, concluding that the last is the
worst of these three types of misfortune. [77]
When examining the third case, the Madhyama-āgama version takes up in additional
detail the reasons for the Tathāgata’s secluded life style. In agreement with a standard
specification found in other discourses, the Madhyama-āgama version explains that the
Tathāgata dwells in seclusion out of compassion for others and because it constitutes a
pleasant abiding for himself. [78]
The Madhyama-āgama discourse also gives the warning that, because of engaging in
excessive socializing, a disciple who has already reached the four jhānas may lose
them again. [79]
According to the Mahāsuññata-sutta and its parallels, a disciple who follows the
teacher’s compassionate instructions behaves towards the teacher with friendliness,
whereas not to follow the teacher’s instruction amounts to hostile behaviour on the side
of the disciple.
The parallel versions report that the Buddha instructed Ānanda that he should show
such friendly behaviour towards his teacher. The Buddha further explained that he was
not going to treat Ānanda like a potter treats his material. [80] This image recurs in a Jātaka tale that describes a meeting between the Buddha and Ānanda in a former life. According to this tale, on that former occasion the Buddha had used the same simile to illustrate his way of teaching. [81]

77 [[MN122]] at MN III 117,13, [[MA191]] at T I 740b12, and the Tibetan version in Skilling 1994a: 256,8. [[MN122]] at MN III 117,14 stands alone in suggesting that the third case not only has the most painful and bitter results, but even leads to rebirth in a lower realm, vinipātāya sa�vattati. The same dire prospect of
rebirth in a lower realm recurs in similar terms in relation to ordaining under false pretences in [[SN12.70]]
at SN II 128,19, where the parallel [[SA347]] at T II 98a10 also does not mention the prospect of any lower
rebirth.
78 [[MA191]] at T I 740a19: “because of dwelling in happiness here and now myself and because of compassion for later born people”, . The same two reasons recur in [[MN4]] at MN
I 23,34 and in [[AN2.3]].9 at AN I 60,30 to explain the Buddha’s secluded life style.
79 [[MA191]] at T I 740b1: “even if because of former energetic and diligent practice he has reached the four
higher states of mind and dwellings in happiness, the disciple can loose these because of much socializing”, .
80 [[MN122]] at MN III 118,3, [[MA191]] at T I 740b28, and the Tibetan version in Skilling 1994a: 260,10. Horner
1959: 162 note 1 comments: “whereas the potter gives, and can give, his vessels one chance only, the
Teacher is undefeated by any initial failure there may be”; cf. also Cicuzza 2004: 391. Ps IV 166,11, however, suggests the point of this simile to be that a potter treats his raw products with much care, in order
to avoid their breaking. Yet, once the products are burnt, he tests them again and again, just as the Buddha was willing to test his disciples 自現法樂居故 again and ... 慈愍後生人 again. The commentarial explanation does not fit the discourse too well, since the simile does not allude to a difference between raw and baked products and also
does not relate the Buddha’s way of handling disciples to the way a potter handles his finished products.
81 Jā 406 at Jā III 368,16. The same image recurs in the Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1978a: 78,19, where it
also serves to illustrate the Buddha’s role as a teacher, although the occasion for this is a discourse given 若彼得四增上心現法樂居, 本為精勤無放逸遊行故, 此或可有失以弟子多集會故
by the Buddha after Devadatta had requested the Buddha to retire and hand over the leadership of the
Sa�gha; for yet another occurrence in the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya cf. Przyluski 1914: 513.

[[MN123]] Acchariyabbhutadhamma-sutta [82]

The Acchariyabbhutadhamma-sutta, the “discourse on [the Buddha’s] wonderful and
marvellous qualities”, presents a description given by Ānanda of a range of various
extraordinary qualities and events related to the birth of ‘the bodhisattva’, who was to
become the Buddha Gotama. This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama. [83]

MN III 118 The Acchariyabbhutadhamma-sutta begins by relating that a group of monks had
been conversing about the Buddha’s detailed knowledge of Buddhas of the past. On
being informed about the topic the monks had been discussing, the Buddha encourages
Ānanda to continue by expounding other marvellous qualities of the Buddha. Ānanda
thereon delivers an exposition of the wonderful qualities of his teacher, beginning each
exposition by proclaiming that he had heard about the respective quality from the Buddha himself. [84]
According to the Madhyama-āgama discourse, however, after arising from seclusion
and approaching the Buddha, Ānanda had on his own begun to proclaim the Buddha’s
marvellous qualities. The Madhyama-āgama version also does not specify the Buddha
as the source from which Ānanda had received his information, as in its presentation
Ānanda only remarks that he had heard about the Buddha’s marvellous qualities. [85]

MN III 119   The list of wonderful and marvellous qualities in the two versions differs considerably and several qualities listed in one version are not found in the other (see table 13.2). [86]
The Acchariyabbhutadhamma-sutta begins its account of wonderful and marvellous
qualities with the bodhisattva’s sojourn in the Tusita heaven, describing that he was
mindful and clearly comprehending when arising in the Tusita heaven, during his stay,
and when passing away from the Tusita heaven to enter his mother’s womb. [87] The Madhyama-āgama version only mentions the bodhisattva’s clear awareness when passing
away from the Tusita heaven and entering his mother’s womb. [88]

82 Be-MN III 159,21 has the title Acchariya-abbhuta-sutta and Ce-MN III 286,1 the similar title Acchariyabbhuta-sutta.
83 The parallel is [[MA32]] at T I 469c-471c and agrees with [[MN123]] on location and title ( ). An
examination of [[MN123]] and [[MA32]] together with the Mahāpadāna-sutta and its parallels, can be found
in Bareau 1974a: 203-209, a comparison of [[MN123]] with [[MA32]] in Minh Chau 1964/1991: 66, 159-165,
and 205, a study of the Sanskrit counterparts to [[MN123]] in Windisch 1908: 107-143. For a quotation in
the Tarkajvāla that lists three of the adbhutadharmas in verse form cf. Skilling 1997b: 610-611; on the
significance of the presentation in [[MN123]] cf. also Anālayo 2010f: 28-46.
84 [[MN123]] at MN III 119,18: “I heard this, venerable sir, from the Blessed One’s own mouth, I received it

III 161,1, C [e] -MN III 288,1, and S [e] -MN III 247,18: pa�iggahita�). As the Buddha presumably had related
these qualities on a previous occasion to Ānanda and now requests him to recount them in front of the
monks, [[MN123]] could even give the impression that the Buddha was keen to hear his own praises. This 未曾有法經
is not the case in [[MA32]] according to which Ānanda extolled the Buddha on his own accord.

The presence of mindfulness on the occasion of departing from the Tusita heaven
recurs in the description of the qualities of former Buddhas in the Mahāpadāna-sutta
and its Dīrgha-āgama parallel. [89]
Instead of describing the bodhisattva’s stay in the Tusita heaven from the perspective
of his possession of mindfulness and clear comprehension, the Madhyama-āgama version highlights that, during this stay in the Tusita heaven, the bodhisattva excelled all


in the Mahāsa�vartanīkathā, Okano 1998: 113, speaks of his possession of mindfulness, sm�ti. Minh
Chau 1964/1991: 165 notes that [[MA32]] does not use the expression bodhisattva, but instead refers to the
Buddha even before his awakening with the expression the “Blessed One”, ; for other comparable
instances cf. Anālayo 2010f: 16 note 3.
89 [[DN14]] at DN II 12,4: sato sampajāno. While [[DA1]] at T I 3c16 records the bodhisattva’s unmuddled
mindfulness on entry into the womb,, T 2 at T I 152b26 does not mention mindfulness or
clear comprehension. According to Ji�acariya 3 in Jacobi 1879/1966: 34,7 (translated Jacobi 1884/
1996: 219), Mahāvīra was aware of being about to descend into his mother’s womb and of having descended, only at the actual moment of descending he was not aware, caissāmi ’tti jā�ai, cayamā�e na
jā�ai, cue ’mi ’tti jā�ai.

the other previously born devas in regard to such qualities as length of life, beauty, and
glory. [90]
The Madhyama-āgama account precedes its depiction of the bodhisattva’s sojourn in
the Tusita heaven by proclaiming that another marvellous and wonderful quality of the
Buddha, which comes as the first in its listing, was the bodhisattva’s initial vow to become a Buddha when he lived the holy life under Kassapa Buddha. [91] Notably the Gha�īkāra-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel, whose topic is the lifetime of the bodhisattva under Kassapa Buddha, do not mention such a vow at all. [92]

MN III 120  According to the Acchariyabbhutadhamma-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel,
the bodhisattva’s entry into his mother’s womb was accompanied by the manifestation
of a great light and an earthquake. [93] The presence of a great radiance on this occasion
is also reported in a discourse in the A�guttara-nikāya that is concerned with four marvellous qualities of the Buddha, of which the other three are the manifestation of a great
light when the bodhisattva left the womb, when he reached awakening, and when he
started to teach. [94] According to the Mahāpadāna-sutta and its Chinese and Sanskrit

90 [[MA32]] at T I 470a2. The bodhisattva’s excellence in this respect is also recorded in [[DN30]] at DN III
146,3, which adds his excellence in happiness, power, divine sights, divine sounds, divine smells, divine
tastes, and divine touches.
91 [[MA32]] at T I 469c24: “the Blessed One at the time of Kassapa Buddha made his initial vow to [realize]
Buddhahood [while] practising the holy life”, . For a more detailed
examination of this passage and its implications cf. Anālayo 2010f: 84-92.
92 [[MN81]] MN II 45-54 and [[MA63]] at T I 499a-503a; although the Mahāvastu does adopt this perspective
and even reports that he received a corresponding prediction from Kassapa Buddha, cf. in more detail
above p. 450. [[MA32]] at T I 469c27 presents the life of the bodhisattva under Kassapa Buddha as the last
life before his stay in the Tusita heaven, as does the Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1977: 21,1, while according to Jā I 47,16 and Ps IV 169,7 the life that preceded his stay in the Tusita heaven was as Vessantara, described, e.g., in Jā 547 at Jā VI 479,1 (the Sa�ghabhedavastu’s counterpart to this tale can be
found in Gnoli 1978a: 119,10).
93 [[MN123]] at MN III 120,8+15 and [[MA32]] at T I 470a15. According to the Mahāvastu in Basak 1963a:
251,6 or in Senart 1882a: 206,16 and in Basak 1965: 世尊迦葉佛時, 14,9 or in Senart 始願佛道, 1890: 行梵行 10,9, the bodhisattva’s mindful and clearly comprehending descent into his mother’s womb was accompanied by six earthquakes, a
number of earthquakes also recorded in the Lalitavistara in Hokazono 1994: 376,4 or in Lefmann 1902:
51,19 or in Vaidya 1958b: 39,10, whereas the Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1977: 41,7 only reports a single
great earthquake accompanied by light. For a study of earthquakes in Buddhist literature cf. Ciurtin 2009.
Reynolds 1985: 214 comments that “the Buddha’s birth is presented as a cosmic event in which his character as a mahāpurisa ... is evident to those who have the eyes to see”.
94 [[AN4.127]] at AN II 130,20. According to [[AN1.70]] at AN I 22,28, with the manifestation of a Tathāgata, a great eye, a great clarity, and a great light manifest, mahato cakkhussa ... mahato ālokassa ... mahato obhāsassa pātubhāvo hoti. Judging from this reference to a “great eye”, the manifestations mentioned in this passage may not be meant literally, but may rather intend to symbolically depict the effect
of the teaching activities of a Tathāgata. Could the descriptions of actual light that accompanied the bodhisattva’s entry into the womb or his birth, such as found in [[MN123]] or in [[AN4.127]] have their origin
in a literal interpretation of a similar passage? On the other hand, however, such notions appear to be
part of a shared heritage, in fact the Jain �hā�a�ga 4.324 in Jambūvijaya 1985: 141,4 also lists four occasions for the manifestation of a great radiance, namely when [future] arahants take birth, when they go
forth, when they attain realization, and when they attain final Nirvā�a.


Chapter 13 Suññata-vagga                                      -  705


counterparts, the manifestation of a great light and an earthquake are the rule on the
occasion when a bodhisattva’s descends into his mother’s womb. [95] In fact, most of the
qualities of Gotama Buddha described in the remainder of the Acchariyabbhutadhamma-sutta are, according to the Mahāpadāna-sutta and its parallels, normative for Buddhas in general. [96]
The Acchariyabbhutadhamma-sutta next takes up the outer conditions of the bodhisattva’s sojourn in his mother’s womb, describing that four devas protected him, [97] and
that his mother was virtuous, free from sensual thoughts and affliction, but at the same
time enjoyed the five types of sense pleasure and was able to see the bodhisattva in her
womb. [98]
The Madhyama-āgama version does not mention these circumstances. Instead, it
focuses on the bodhisattva’s condition inside the womb by describing that he rested in
the womb on his right side, was able to stretch his body, and was not sullied by blood
or any other bodily filth. [99]

95 [[DN14]] at DN II 12,6, [[DA1]] at T I 3c14, and the Sanskrit version in fragment 420dR6 in Fukita 2003: 53
(93.6) or in Waldschmidt 1953: 45. Gokhale 1994/2001e: 98 explains that “these events are explained as
the result of dhammatā ... implying that they are not causally connected with the [respective] Buddha as
such, but occur because it is the nature or order of things”.
96 Bareau 1974a: 240, 245, and 254 suggests that several elements of the account of Gotama’s youth may
at first have been developed as part of a fictional account of the former Buddha Vipassī. Subsequently
this fictional account would have been understood to exemplify the rule for all Buddhas and would then
have been applied to the case of Gotama as well.
97 [[MN123]] at MN III 120,22. The presence of four guardian deities is also recorded in the Lalitavistara in
Hokazono 1994: 372,5 or in Lefmann 1902: 50,5 or in Vaidya 1958b: 38,3, in the Mahāvastu in Basak
1965: 15,5 or in Senart 1890: 10,19, and in the Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1977: 42,3. Ps IV 179,5 explains that these were the Four Great Kings, catunna� mahārājāna� vasena vutta�, to whom the Lalitavistara refers as the four “protectors of the four directions”, caturdiśāsu pālā�, and the Mahāvastu as
the four “world protectors”, lokapālā. In the Sa�ghabhedavastu the protectors are instead Śakra together
with four devaputras.
98 [[MN123]] at MN III 120,30 and MN III 121,3+10+17+19. According to the Lalitavistara in Hokazono
1994: 352,1 or in Lefmann 1902: 41,18 or in Vaidya 1958b: 29,26, as well as according to the Mahāvastu in Basak 1965: 8,3 or in Senart 1890: 6,2, the virtuous conduct of the bodhisattva’s mother had already begun before the bodhisattva descended into her womb. [[MN123]] at MN III 121,20 illustrates the
ability of the mother to see the child in her womb with the image of a coloured thread strung through a
beryl gem, an image found in the same context also in the Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1977: 42,16. The
Lalitavistara in Hokazono 1994: 418,16 or in Lefmann 1902: 72,9 or in Vaidya 1958b: 53,20 compares
her vision of the bodhisattva to looking at one’s own face in a clean mirror. According to the Mahāvastu in Basak 1965: 23,10 or in Senart 1890: 16,16, she saw him as if she were seeing a body of gold, a
vision comparable to a beryl placed in a crystal casket. On the parallelism that these descriptions establish between the mother and a caitya cf. Drewes 2007: 107-110. Durt 2003: 44 notes that as part of “a
larger programme of quasi-deification of the Buddha ... Māyā appears as a living tabernacle sheltering
her son”. Rhys Davids 1910: 10 note 1 remarks that “the myth of the visible embryo recurs in medieval
Christian art”.
99 [[MA32]] at T I 470a27. That the bodhisattva was not sullied while staying in the womb is also recorded in
the Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1977: 42,7. For a study of marvels related to the bodhisattva’s birth, in
contrast to ancient Indian perceptions of the average conditions of being born, cf. Hara 1980.


706   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


MN III 122  Another marvellous quality of the Buddha, listed in the Acchariyabbhutadhamma-sutta, is that the bodhisattva’s mother passed away seven days after giving birth and was
reborn in the Tusita heaven. [100] The Madhyama-āgama version does not mention the
mother’s death at all.
In relation to this difference, it is noteworthy that the two parallel versions present
the qualities they enumerate in a chronological order. Thus, the Acchariyabbhutadhamma-sutta begins with the bodhisattva’s arising in the the Tusita heaven, then mentions
the qualities related to his sojourn in the Tusita heaven, followed by taking up his departure from the Tusita heaven and entry into the mother’s womb, after which it turns
to the qualities related to his stay in the mother’s womb. In continuation of this pattern,
qualities related to the mother’s pregnancy and her giving birth should come next. Instead, the Acchariyabbhutadhamma-sutta takes up the death of the bodhisattva’s
mother, after which it continues by describing her pregnancy and giving birth.
Thus, the reference to the death of the bodhisattva’s mother comes out of sequence, a
circumstance that points to a later addition. In fact, as part of a list of wonderful and
marvellous qualities of the Buddha, the premature death of his mother does not fit the
context too well.
The Udāna dedicates a whole discourse to the premature death of the bodhisattva’s
mother. This discourse, which also has the Buddha and Ānanda as its protagonists,
qualifies the mother’s premature death as something that is wonderful and marvellous
as such. [101] That is, unlike the Acchariyabbhutadhamma-sutta, the Udāna discourse does
not reckon her early death as a marvellous quality of the Buddha, but only as something
marvellous in general. This way of presentation seems more natural than the inclusion
of her death in a list of wonderful and marvellous qualities of the Buddha.
In view of the out-of-sequence placing of the mother’s death in the Acchariyabbhutadhamma-sutta, it could be that, at some point during the transmission of the Pāli discourses, this passage from the Udāna came to be added to the account of the marvel
100 [[MN123]] at MN III 122,2: “seven days after the bodhisattva has been born, his mother passes away and
arises in the Tusita heaven ... this too, venerable sir, I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of
the Blessed One”, sattāhajāte ... bodhisatte bodhisattamātā kāla� karoti, tusita� kāya� uppajjatī ti ...
idam p’ aha�, bhante, bhagavato acchariya� abbhutadhamma� dhāremi. References to the death of the
mother seven days after giving birth can also be found in the Lalitavistara in Hokazono 1994: 470,5 or
in Lefmann 1902: 98,3 or in Vaidya 1958b: 70,25, in the Mahāvastu in Basak 1965: 5,1 or in Senart
1890: 3,18 (in this instance the same is implicit in the indication that she would live only for seven days
in addition to the time of pregnancy), in the Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1977: 51,18, and in several
biographies of the Buddha, preserved in Chinese, cf., e.g., T 184 at T III 465a23, T 185 at T III 474b7, T
188 at T III 618b14, and T 189 at T III 623b9. Obeyesekere 1997: 475 suggests that “the death of Māyā
seven days after the Buddha’s birth cannot be taken literally, or even to mean that ‘she died soon after’
... rather, Māyā’s death is a structural requirement of the myth: the pure womb from which the Buddha
was born could not thereafter be contaminated by childbirth or sexual pollution”. Regarding the name of
the bodhisattva’s mother, which [[DN14]] at DN II 52,10 gives as māyā devī, von Hinüber 1995b: 189 suggests that perhaps this “was not originally meant to be a personal name, but simply is the eastern form
corresponding to mātādevī”.
101 [[UD5.2]] at [[UD48.4]]


Chapter 13 Suññata-vagga                                      -  707


lous qualities of the Buddha in the Acchariyabbhutadhamma-sutta, an addition made
without proper regard for the chronological sequence of the qualities in this discourse.
After referring to the death of the bodhisattva’s mother, the Acchariyabbhutadhamma-sutta continues by noting the length of her pregnancy and by describing that she remained standing while giving birth, [102] details not mentioned in its Madhyama-āgama
counterpart. This unusual manner of giving birth recurs regularly in various Buddha
biographies, often accompanied by the further specification that the bodhisattva issued
from the right side of his mother. [103] The Mahāvastu of the Mahāsā�ghika-Lokottaravāda Vinaya reports the same and then takes up the question how he managed to come
out without hurting her, a dilemma the Mahāvastu solves with the ingenious suggestion
that a Tathāgata takes birth through a mind-made body. [104]


102 [[MN123]] at MN III 122,7+15. The length of her pregnancy is also recorded in the Lalitavistara in Hokazono 1994: 420,15 or in Lefmann 1902: 73,11 or in Vaidya 1958b: 54,7, as well as in the Mahāvastu in
Basak 1965: 25,11 or in Senart 1890: 18,7. Franke 1914b: 337 note 1 and Printz 1925: 120 explain that
the reference to ten months of pregnancy would refer to lunar months; cf. also Durt 2002: 46, who speaks
of a ten month period of gestation “according to the classical Indian method of calculation”.
103 This is recorded, e.g., in the Buddhacarita 1:9 in Johnston 1936/1995a: 1, in the Mahāvastu in Basak
1963a: 250,8 or in Senart 1882a: 206,4, in T 184 at T III 463c13, in T 185 at T III 473c1, in T 188 at T
III 618a17, in T 189 at T III 625a24, in T 193 at T IV 58b21, and in Bu ston’s “History of Buddhism” in

That the Buddha issued from the side of his mother was also known to Hieronymus, cf. Dihle 1965: 38.
[[EA48.3]] at T II 788b2 predicts that the future Buddha Maitreya will take birth in the same manner.
Bollée 2005: 15 suggests that “the lateral birth idea ... perhaps ... originated in the custom of carrying
children on the hip”. Dayal 1932/1970: 298 notes that “the idea of being born from the mother’s side is
referred to in a hymn of the �gveda (iv, 18.1)”. Printz 1925: 125 explains that, according to ancient
Indian beliefs, when a foetus is on the right side of the mother’s womb it will be a boy, while a foetus
on the left side shows that it will be a girl, which would explain why according to the traditional account
the bodhisattva dwelled on the right side of his mother’s womb and issued from her right side (that he
dwelled on the right side of his mother’s womb is explicitly mentioned as one of the marvellous qualities
in [[MA32]] at T I 470a27). The association of a male child with the right side occurs, e.g., in the Divyāvadāna, Cowell 1886: 2,7 or Vaidya 1999: 1,17: saced dārako bhavati dak�i�a� kuk�i� niśritya
ti��hati, saced dārikā bhavati vāma� kuk�i� niśritya ti��hati; cf. also Abhidh-k 3:15 in Pradhan 1967:
126,24, T 1558 at T XXIX 46c17 or T 1559 at T XXIX 203b27. Bucknell 1980: 40 explains that in ancient Indian religious thought the female is associated with the left side of the body, as well as with the
moon, water, the out-breath, and vowels, while the male is associated with the right side of the body,
with the sun, fire, the in-breath, and consonants.
104 The Mahāvastu in Basak 1963a: 266,14 or Senart 1882a: 218,15 and Basak 1965: 29,3 or Senart 1890:
20,16 explains that manomayena rūpe�a prādurbhonti tathāgatā, a proposition which Jones 1949/1973:
174 note 1 classifies as a typical “tenet of the Lokottaravādins”. Rahula 1978: 74 notes that, soon after
giving this explanation, “the justification is forgotten in an attempt to reason the seven strides, which


708   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


The Acchariyabbhutadhamma-sutta and its parallel agree that, on being born, the bodhisattva was received by gods. [105] The two versions describe that his body was not sullied by any dirt, but nevertheless two fountains of cold and warm water appeared miraculously to bathe him. [106] To this the Madhyama-āgama version adds the miraculous
appearance of a lake so that the mother could also take a bath, as well as a rain of heavenly flowers showered on the newborn baby. [107]

MN III 123  The two parallel discourses agree that a great radiance and an earthquake accompanied the bodhisattva’s birth, after which he took seven steps. [108] The Pāli commentary
explains, in agreement with two Chinese biographies of the Buddha, that the seven
steps taken by the bodhisattva right after his birth symbolize his later revelation of the
seven factors of awakening (bojjha�ga). [109]
According to the Majjhima-nikāya discourse, not only was the bodhisattva able to
walk right after being born, he even spoke at this point, proclaiming that he was the


was necessary, according to the tradition (āgama), because the bodhisattva was tired of the ten months’
uterine confinement”, cf. Basak 1965: 29,10 or Senart 1890: 21,3.
105 [[MN123]] at MN III 122,21 considers this as two qualities, as it distinguishes between the circumstance
that the bodhisattva was first received by devas and the circumstance that, without touching the ground,
he was received by four gods and presented to his mother. [[MA32]] at T I 470b22 present this issue as a
single quality and does not explicitly mention that he did not touch the ground. For an early depiction
of this event in art cf. Schlingloff 1981a: 186-188 (with references to other representations).
106 [[MN123]] at MN III 122,33 and MN III 123,11, with its counterparts in [[MA32]] at T I 470b2 and T I 470c7,

1958b: 61,21 and 62,1, in the Mahāvastu in Basak 1965: 33,3 and 34,4 or in Senart 1890: 24,1+20 (the
miraculous appearance of the two fountains of water comes up again in Basak 1968/2004: 228,8 or in
Senart 1897: 380,13), and in the Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1977: 45,5+16. The Sa�ghabhedavastu in
Gnoli 1977: 40,6 expands on the theme of the purity of the mother’s womb, as it reports that, already
before the bodhisattva descended into the womb, Śakra had cleaned up the mother’s womb to make it
ready for receiving the bodhisattva (for a Jain counterpart to this motif cf. Alsdorf 1947: 125 and Roth
1983: 182). Klimkeit 2000: 222 explains that the emphasis in these passages is to contrast the purity of
the bodhisattva with the defilement of worldliness symbolized by the mother’s womb. Robinson 1970/
1982: 7 remarks that “the purpose of all the mythical elements in the nativity cycle is to show that the
Bodhisattva was innately different from ordinary man”. Schlingloff 1962b: 86 explains that descriptions of the Buddha’s life were not meant as historical records, hence to treat them as such misunderstands their purpose (“die Lebensbeschreibungen wollten nicht historische Reminiszenzen an tatsächliche Ergeinisse ... überliefern; sie wollten auch nicht etwa durch erfundene Berichte Authentizität vortäuschen. Wenn wir derartige Absichten voraussetzen, unterstellen wir den Erzählern ein historisches
Bewußtsein, daß jener Zeit völlig fremd war”); cf. also Klimkeit 1990: 35. Thus, e.g., the appearance of
fountains of water to bathe the anyway unsullied bodhisattva has simply a symbolic function.
107 [[MA32]] at T I 470c3+11; cf. also the Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1977: 45,18. According to [[MN123]] at
MN III 122,14, the two fountains of water were for the use of the bodhisattva and of his mother, so that
in its account there is no need for an additional source of water for the mother to clean herself.

highest being in the world and that this was his last birth. [110] The Madhyama-āgama
discourse does not record any proclamation made on this occasion. Other biographies
of the Buddha preserved in Chinese, Sanskrit, and Tibetan concur with the Majjhimanikāya report that the newborn bodhisattva made a proclamation. [111] While some only
record his proclamation of being supreme, [112] others agree with the Acchariyabbhutadhamma-sutta that the bodhisattva also claimed that this was his last birth. [113]
Numerous other discourses associate the proclamation to have reached the last birth
with the Buddha’s awakening. [114] For the bodhisattva to make such a proclamation already right after his birth would imply that he was inevitably destined to awakening.
From this perspective, his struggle to reach awakening by various methods was anyway destined to end successfully. The assumption that the Buddha’s awakening was
inevitable already at his birth shows the beginning of tendencies that in the course of
time led some traditions to assume that he was already awakened at birth and that his
activities were merely an illusory display for the sake of saving sentient beings. [115]

110 [[MN123]] at MN III 123,21: aggo ’ham asmi lokassa ... ayam antimā jāti, n’ atthi dāni punabbhavo.
According to [[DN3]] at DN I 93,6 and its parallel [[DA20]] at T I 83a8, the ability to speak right after birth
was not a prerogative of the bodhisattva, as the boy Ka�ha had also been able to speak right after his
birth. Unlike the bodhisattva, however, instead of making a majestic proclamation he asked his mother
to wash him, because he had such dark skin. For another instance where a baby is able to speak right on
being born cf. [[UD2.8]] at [[UD17.27]] for accounts of the future Buddha’s ability to speak as a newly born
baby in former lives cf. Jā 546 at Jā VI 331,15 and Jā 547 at Jā VI 485,14. Derrett 1992: 54 notes occurrences of the motif of a newly-born baby able to walk and speak in ancient Greek mythology. Karetzky 1992: 16 comments that “because no child can immediately walk or talk, let alone make proclamations at birth, it is by these acts that the Buddha’s prodigious nature, even as an infant, is revealed”.
On the significance of this event cf. also, e.g., Anālayo 2010f: 38-46, Eliade 1948, and Irwin 1981.
111 Gaffney 1996: 84 notes that in [[MN123]] “the description of his [the Buddha’s] birth is full of what might
almost be called doecetic tendencies”. Nakamura 1980/1999: 18 comments that “the verse ... proclaimed
by the Buddha at his birth was composed very late”. Silk 2003: 864 comments that according to the proclamation of supremacy the bodhisattva “is virtually fully awakened (‘enlightened’) from the moment of
his birth”, highlighting the resulting contrast where “the infant, upon his birth, knows everything; the
young man he becomes knows nothing”.

710   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


While in the Majjhima-nikāya version Ānanda’s account of wonderful and marvellous qualities of the Buddha comes to an end at this point, the Madhyama-āgama discourse continues to explore the same theme in relation to later events in the Buddha’s
life, describing that:

       - on several occasions the shadow of a tree did not move in order to give protection to the Buddha who was seated at its roots in meditation, [116]

       - a monkey took the Buddha’s bowl, filled it with honey, and offered it to him, [117]

       - a cloud did not rain until the Buddha had recovered his sitting mat, which he had
put out in the sun to dry, [118]

       - the Buddha was in such deep meditation that he did not hear a storm that killed
four oxen and two men, [119]

       - after a great rain and flooding the path for the Buddha to practise walking meditation stayed dry, [120]

       - Māra followed the Buddha for six years, [121]

       - the Buddha practised mindfulness of the body uninterruptedly for seven years. [122]

MN III 124  The Acchariyabbhutadhamma-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama counterpart agree that,
in reply to Ānanda’s exposition of wonderful and marvellous qualities, the Buddha also
came out with one of his outstanding qualities. This was his ability to know clearly the
arising, the presence, and the disappearance of feelings, perceptions, and thoughts, there

really leave the Tusita heaven and what was seen in the human world was only a magical apparition,

served as repositories of the transcendental Buddha” conception.

121 [[MA32]] at T I 471c14. [[SNP3.2]] at [[SNP446]] speaks instead of seven years, while the Lalitavistara in Lefmann 1902: 260,17 or in Vaidya 1958b: 191,2 agrees with [[MA32]] on six years. Oldenberg 1881/1961:
366 note 50 suggests that references to seven years may intend the whole period of going forth, while
those to six years may only cover the period spent in ascetic practices. Nakamura 2000a: 170 instead
explains that “in ancient India periods of time were expressed both in terms of full years (how much
time had actually elapsed) and calendar years. The difference in the number of years mentioned may
arise from different methods of counting”.
122 [[MA32]] at T I 471c17: . This brings to mind the prediction in the Satipa��hāna-sutta and its parallels, according to which non-returning or awakening can be reached within a maximum
period of seven years of satipa��hāna practice, cf. [[DN22]] at DN II 314,11, [[MN10]] at MN I 62,34, and
[[MA98]] at T I 584b16.

by presenting a quality related to meditative mastery of the mind as the culmination point
of the present listing of marvellous qualities. [123]
Thus, even though a major part of the description of wonderful and marvellous qualities in the Acchariyabbhutadhamma-sutta is different from its Madhyama-āgama parallel and appears to be reflecting later tendencies and ideas, the final point made in both
versions remains the same, in that attention is directed back to the ability to observe the
functioning of the mind. [124]


[[MN124]] Bakkula-sutta [125]

The Bakkula-sutta, the “discourse [spoken by] Bakkula”, sets forth the exemplary
conduct of the monk Bakkula. This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama. [126]
The Bakkula-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel begin by relating that the monk
Bakkula was visited by a former friend from the time before he had gone forth. This
former friend wanted to know how often Bakkula had engaged in sex during the eighty
years he had been a monk.
In reply, in both versions Bakkula made it clear that he had not even had a perception
related to sensuality during this entire period. [127] The Majjhima-nikāya version adds that,
during the entire period of his monkhood, Bakkula also never had a perception related
to aversion and cruelty, nor any thought related to sensuality, aversion, or cruelty. [128]
In both versions, Bakkula continues by listing various other qualities he possesses,
which show some divergences between the two versions (see table 13.3). The Bakkula

123 [[MN123]] at MN III 124,11 and [[MA32]] at T I 471c21, which speaks of feelings, thoughts/intentions, and
perceptions,, and, as the objects of such knowledge. This type of contemplation recurs in other
Pāli discourses, cf., e.g., [[DN33]] at DN III 223,11 and [[AN7.47]] at AN II 45,17, where the counterpart
passage in the Sa�gītiparyāya, T 1536 at T XXVI 395c21, agrees with the Pāli versions on speaking of
feelings, perceptions, and thoughts, (the Sa�gīti-sūtra restored in Stache-Rosen 1968: 113
only lists the four types of samādhibhāvanā�, without giving details of their implications). Another occurrence is [[AN8.9]] at AN IV 168,12, in which case the parallels [[SA275]] at T II 73b24 and SĀ [2] 6 at T II
375b10 list “feelings”,, “perceptions”,, and then, which judging from the context might stand
for “thought”, in fact a Sanskrit fragment of the same discourse, SHT VI 1226 folio 5V2 (p. 22) has preserved (vi)[d](i)tā vivar[k]ā [u]tpadyanti, which, as the editors in footnote 43 suggest, should be corrected to vitarkā, “thoughts”.
124 A minor difference 覺 思 is that 想 in [[MN123]] Ānanda repeats this statement, wherefore [[MN123]] concludes with
the monks rejoicing in Ānanda’s statement, while [[MA32]] concludes with the monks and Ānanda rejoicing in the Buddha’s exposition.
125 Be-MN III 165,25 has the title Bākula-sutta 受, 想, and 尋 Se-MN III 255,1 Bakkulattheracchariyabbhūta-sutta.
The Burmese edition continues to refer to its protagonist as Bākula.
126 The parallel is [[MA34]] at T I 475a-c and agrees with [[MN124]] on location and title (, which
uses the same way or rendering Bakkula’s name as 受 想 Mahāvyutpatti 覺 no. 1065 in Sakaki 1926: 81). On

sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel agree that for the entire period of his monkhood
Bakkula could claim that he:

 - never wore or accepted robes from householders,

 - never cut robes,

 - never made robes for another monk,

 - never sewed robes with a needle. [129]
The two versions continue with Bakkula’s proclamation that he never accepted an invitation to a meal. According to the Majjhima-nikāya version, he also:

 - never hoped for such an invitation,

 - never partook of a meal inside a house,

 - never sat down inside a house,

 - never interrupted the practice of begging for alms,

 - never went to beg in superior households in order to get better food. [130]
According to the Majjhima-nikāya account, Bakkula never mentally grasped at the
signs and secondary details of women. [131] The Madhyama-āgama version explains that
he never looked women in the face. [132] The two versions agree that he never visited the
nuns’ quarters.
According to the Majjhima-nikāya report, Bakkula never taught nuns or female novices, while according to the Madhyama-āgama description he never spoke to nuns, not
even when meeting them on the road. [133]

129 [[MN124]] at MN III 126,6: nābhijānāmi sūciyā cīvara� sibbitā and [[MA34]] at T I 475b12:
. For Bakkula to claim never having used a needle is surprising, since whether he wore rag robes
or robes made by householders, both types of robe would need to be mended from time to time (in fact
[[EA23.2]] at T II 611c4 describes him mending his own set of robes, on this discourse cf. also Legittimo
2009 and Anālayo 2010j). According to [[MN124]] at MN III 126,8, Bakkula also never dyed a robe,
which similarly would be difficult to avoid in a hot and humid climate like India, where the natural dye
used for robes requires renewal from time to time. The commentary, Ps IV 193,24, explains that his
relatives made rag robes for him and dyed them, leaving them out for him when he went to bathe. Bakkula then dressed in those new robes and gave his old robes to other monks, so that a need to mend his
robes never arose. It is not easy to see how such conduct could be considered a particularly praiseworthy way of obtaining robes. 未曾用針

133 [[MA34]] at T I 475b22. [[MN124]] at MN III 126,19 also mentions that he never taught even four phrases to
a woman, while according to [[MA34]] at T I 475b26 he never spoke even four phrases towards laity in
general. This brings to mind a pācittiya or pātayantika rule according to which a monk should not speak
more than five or six phrases to a woman when alone with her, cf. the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, T 1428
at T XXII 640b14, the Mahāsā�ghika Vinaya, T 1425 at T XXII 336a17, the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya, T 1421
at T XXII 38c24, the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, T 1442 at T XXIII 771b18, the Sarvāstivāda Vinaya,
T 1435 at T XXIII 70c8, and the Theravāda Vinaya at Vin IV 21,37, all of which agree on formulating
the rule in terms of speaking not more than “five or six phrases”,, chappañcavācāhi (the sequence
“six or five” in the Pāli version would be due to the law of waxing syllables) 未曾視女人面 . Horner 1930/1990: 368 is

The Majjhima-nikāya version, moreover, highlights that Bakkula never ordained or
gave dependence, nor did he ever have a novice as his attendant, while the Madhyamaāgama version only records that he never trained a novice. [134]

stands in contrast to the importance given elsewhere in the discourses to teaching laity, both men and
women. Yet, to appreciate the significance of this rule, it needs to be kept in mind that according to the
explanation given at Vin IV 23,6 there is no problem if a monk teaches in reply to a question, that is,
the regulation only refers to a monk who on his own approaches a woman and wants to give her teachings in private. Besides, the same rule applies vice versa to a nun, who similarly should not give private
teachings to a male on her own initiative.

MN III 127  The two versions continue by recording that Bakkula never became sick and therefore
never made use of any medicine. [135] According to the list of eminent disciples in the
A�guttara-nikāya, Bakkula was indeed foremost among the monks in matters of health. [136]
The Majjhima-nikāya account also notes that Bakkula:

       - never engaged in bathing in a bath house,

       - never used bathing powder,

       - never gave a massage,

       - never used a reclining board or a bed,

       - never observed the rains retreat period within a village. [137]
The Majjhima-nikāya version concludes its list of Bakkula’s qualities with his attainment of final knowledge a week after going forth, [138] while the Madhyama-āgama version reports that Bakkula attained the three realizations within three days and nights. [139]
After hearing this account of Bakkula’s marvellous qualities, according to the Majjhima-nikāya version his former friend Acela Kassapa decided to go forth and, having
received the higher ordination, in due time became an arahant. This series of events is
not recorded in the Madhyama-āgama version, which also does not give the name of
Bakkula’s friend and only indicates that he was a heterodox practitioner. [140]
The going forth of Acela Kassapa recurs also in the Kassapasīhanāda-sutta. This discourse records that Acela Kassapa felt so inspired on hearing an exposition on the topic
of asceticism by the Buddha that he requested ordination and eventually became an arahant. [141] The Dīrgha-āgama parallel to the Kassapasīhanāda-sutta reports the same out

the Chinese, Sanskrit, and Tibetan versions of his stanzas, cf. T 199 at T IV 194c1, Bechert 1961: 145,10,

come of this meeting, differing in so far as it gives the name of its protagonist just as
Kassapa. [142]
The going forth of Acela Kassapa recurs again in a discourse in the Sa�yutta-nikāya.
Similar to the Bakkula-sutta, this discourse begins with Acela Kassapa meeting a former friend, which in this case was the householder Citta. When during the ensuing discussion Acela Kassapa found out that, as a householder, Citta had progressed further
than he had been able to do as a wanderer, he decided to go forth as a Buddhist monk
and eventually became an arahant. [143]
The Sa�yukta-āgama parallel agrees with the Sa�yutta-nikāya version that after a
similar exchange Citta’s former friend decided to go forth and became an arahant. [144]
The Sa�yukta-āgama version differs in so far as it does not give the name of the former friend of Citta, but only indicates that he was an acela, a naked ascetic. [145]
The going forth of Acela Kassapa recurs once more in yet another discourse in the
Sa�yutta-nikāya, where he inquired from the Buddha whether pleasure and pain were
caused by oneself, others, both, or neither. In this case, too, Acela Kassapa was so satisfied with the Buddha’s reply that he requested ordination and eventually became an
arahant. [146]
This discourse has three parallels, one of which is found in the Sa�yukta-āgama, one
parallel is an individual translation, and another parallel has been preserved in Sanskrit
fragments. These three parallels agree with the Pāli version that the protagonist of this
discourse was indeed Acela Kassapa, although according to their report he only became a stream-enterer during the discourse and was soon after killed by a cow. [147]
Thus, in the Chinese Āgamas these four instances seem to be concerned with different
persons, the Dīrgha-āgama discourse with a certain Kassapa, the Madhyama-āgama
discourse with an unnamed wanderer, the Sa�yukta-āgama with an unnamed naked ascetic, while only the last of these four instances, preserved in Chinese and Sanskrit, has
Acela Kassapa as its protagonist. In the corresponding Pāli discourses, in contrast, four
times Acela Kassapa went forth and became an arahant, each time after receiving a different discourse. Unless one were to assume that the name Acela Kassapa refers to four
different persons, the presentation in the Pāli tradition would be self-contradictory.
Returning to the Bakkula-sutta, which in agreement with its Madhyama-āgama parallel reports that Bakkula announced his impending final Nirvā�a to the other monks, [148]

followed by then passing away seated amidst the congregation of monks. According to
the account of this event given in the Pāli commentary, Bakkula had attained the fire
element and cremated himself. [149]
Looking back on the two versions of the present discourse, it is noteworthy that according to both versions at the time of this discourse Bakkula had been ordained for eighty
years. [150] For Bakkula to be a monk for eighty years implies that the meeting recorded
in the present discourse must have taken place after the Buddha’s passing away. Even
if Bakkula should have been one of the first monks ordained by the Buddha, for him to
reach eighty years of monkhood implies that the forty-five years period of the Buddha’s teaching activities was long over. [151]
That is, the events described in the Bakkula-sutta and its parallel would have to be
placed considerably later than the so-called first council, which according to the
traditional account was convened soon after the Buddha’s demise. [152]
It is also noteworthy that the listings of his qualities in the two versions shows numerous divergences and that both versions follow each of the declarations made by
Bakkula with a narrator’s acclamation, which praises each quality of Bakkula for its
wonderful and marvellous nature. [153] This type of repeated acclamation is an unusual
feature for a discourse and further supports the impression of the comparative lateness
of the Bakkula-sutta. [154]
The Pāli commentary in fact explains that the Bakkula-sutta was included in the canonical collection only at the so-called second council. [155] This explanation is remarkable in so far as it shows that the commentators were conscious of the fact that the Nikāyas on which they were commenting could not have been recited in this form at the
first council or rehearsal, sa�gīti.


bly refers to a simple type of lock, found at the inside of a door, whose bolt can be closed from the outside with the help of a rope that is connected to this bolt and then put through a small hole in the door
so as to be accessible from the outside. The same rope does, however, not allow opening the door from
the outside, for which an apāpura�a is required, a simple type of “key” that allows opening any lock of
such a type. Hence, with the help of an apāpura�a any door with this kind of lock in a monastery could
be opened in order to enter and convey some message to the monk(s) staying inside.

151 According to [[MA34]] at T I 475a13, however, this discourse took place soon after the Buddha’s final
Nirvā�a, . Since a period of over thirty-five years would not be “soon”,, this
seems to be a case of applying a standard pericope without consideration of the context.

[[MN125]] Dantabhūmi-sutta

The Dantabhūmi-sutta, the “discourse on the [progressive] stages of [being] tamed”,
compares the gradual training of a monk to the gradual taming of a wild elephant. This
discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama. [156] A small section of the present discourse has also a counterpart in a discourse quotation in Śamathadeva’s commentary
on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya, extant in Tibetan. [157]
According to the Dantabhūmi-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel, the novice
Aciravata had unsuccessfully attempted to explain to Prince Jayasena how a monk by
dint of diligent practice could reach unification of the mind. As his explanation had not
met with the prince’s approval, Aciravata approached the Buddha to report what had
happened.
The two versions record that the Buddha replied by pointing out that it was impossible for Prince Jayasena, who was living immersed in sensual pleasures, to come to know
what can be realized only by renouncing sensual pleasures. By way of illustration, the
Buddha contrasted tamed animals with their untamed counterparts. [158] Another example
to illustrate the same point depicts a man who takes his friend to the top of a mountain in
order to show him the scenery that lies on the other side of the mountain, a scenery whose
existence the friend earlier, before getting on top of the mountain, had put into doubt. [159]
According to the Majjhima-nikāya account, the Buddha told Aciravata that, if he had
used these two similes, he would have fared better in his meeting with Prince Jayasena.
Aciravata replied that he had never heard these similes before, hence, he could not have
been able to make use of them. This exchange is not found in the Madhyama-āgama version.
The Dantabhūmi-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel continue by comparing the
gradual training of a disciple to the gradual taming of a forest elephant. [160] The two

156 The parallel is [[MA198]] at T I 757a-759a and agrees with [[MN125]] on location and title ( ). A
translation of [[MA198]] together with extracts from the present study, can be found in Anālayo 2006c.
157 Abhidh-k-� at D (4094) mngon pa, nyu 40b3-41b1 or Q (5595) thu 79a5-80a7, which corresponds to
[[MN125]] at MN III 135,20 to MN III 136,19; cf. also Abhidh-k 6:70 in Pradhan 1967: 384,22, paralleling [[MN125]] at MN III 136,15, with its Chinese counterparts in T 1558 at T XXIX 133a5 and T 1559 at
T XXIX 284b2.
158 [[MN125]] at MN III 130,2 contrasts two tamed elephants, two tamed horses, and two tamed oxen with
two untamed elephants, two untamed horses, and two untamed oxen. [[MA198]] at T I 757b13 instead
mentions four tameable beings, namely an elephant, a horse, an ox, and a man. Out of these four, it then
contrasts two untamed beings with two tamed beings. A similar pattern can be found in [[MA212]] at T I
794a29, which also has men in addition to the elephants, horses, and oxen mentioned in its counterpart 調御地經
[[MN90]] at MN II 129,4, cf. above p. 522 note 388.
159 A minor difference between the otherwise fairly similar presentations of this image in the two versions
is that, according to [[MN125]] at MN III 131,19, the Buddha explained that the mass of ignorance covering Prince Jayasena was even greater than the mountain described in the simile, a remark not found in
[[MA198]]
160 A minor difference is that in [[MN125]] at MN III 132,2+15 the king gives detailed instructions to the elephant trainer on how he should undertake the task of catching and taming the elephant, whereas in [[MA198]] at T I 757c14+20 the king merely tells the elephant tamer to catch an elephant and to tame it, with

versions agree in comparing the moment when the disciple decides to go forth to the
moment when the forest elephant has been caught and is brought out of the forest into
the open. [161]

MN III 134  The Dantabhūmi-sutta next mentions the need to observe the rules and see danger in
the slightest transgression, [162] while its Madhyama-āgama counterpart simply instructs to
purify body, speech, and mind. [163]
This in itself relatively minor difference is part of a recurring pattern, where the Pāli
discourses appear to have a predilection for the injunction to scrupulously observe the
rules, while their Madhyama-āgama counterparts place more emphasis on the purpose
of observing the rules in terms of the need to develop bodily, verbal, and mental purity. [164]
The Majjhima-nikāya version continues by taking up the practices of:

       - sense-restraint,

       - moderation with food,

       - wakefulness,

       - mindfulness and clear comprehension,

       - the removal of the five hindrances,

       - the four satipa��hānas.
The Madhyama-āgama version instead directly turns to the four satipa��hānas, without mentioning any of the other practices of the gradual path (see table 13.4). The discourse quotation in Śamathadeva’s commentary, however, precedes its description of
the four satipa��hānas with an account of the removal of the five hindrances. [165]

MN III 136   From the perspective of textual transmission, it would be easier to imagine that a reference to the arising of a Tathāgata caused the reciters to supplement a full account of
the gradual path of practice, detailing the undertaking of sense-restraint, moderation
with food, wakefulness etc., than to assume that considerable parts of an account of the
gradual path have been lost. On the hypothesis that the other practices of the gradual
path may have been added to an originally briefer account during the transmission of the


out getting involved in the details of how this should be done. For a description given by Arrian of the
procedure adopted in ancient India to catch wild elephants cf. McCrindle 1877: 213-216.

163 [[MA198]] at T I 758a29.
164 The same difference of emphasis recurs between [[MN6]] at MN I 33,5 and its parallel [[MA105]] at T I
595c19, cf. above p. 47, and between [[MN107]] at MN III 2,7 and its parallel [[MA144]] at T I 652b1, cf.
above p. 618.
165 D (4094) mngon pa, nyu 40b6 or Q (5595) thu 79a8. According to [[MN10]] at MN I 60,11 (or [[DN22]] at
DN II 300,10) and [[MA98]] at T I 584a24, awareness of the presence of the five hindrances is a task that
forms part of satipa��hāna, so that satipa��hāna practice would not necessarily require the previous removal of the five hindrances; cf. also [[AN9.64]] at AN IV 458,5, which presents satipa��hāna as the tool
for overcoming the five hindrances. Nevertheless, for advanced stages of satipa��hāna practice the removal of the five hindrances would be required.


Chapter 13 Suññata-vagga                                      -  719


Pāli version, it would be quite understandable how satipa��hāna was consequently displaced from its original location and came to stand after the removal of the five hindrances and thereby in a position that would better fit the attainment of the jhānas.


Table 13.4: Gradual Training in [[MN125]] and [[MA198]]

The Pāli, Chinese, and Tibetan versions agree in comparing the practice of satipa��hāna to a strong post to which the elephant trainer binds the forest elephant, explaining that the function of the four satipa��hānas is to overcome thoughts related to the
household life. This specification further supports the Madhyama-āgama version’s
presentation, since if the practice of satipa��hāna were to take place after the five hindrances have already been removed, there would be little need for it to perform the
function of overcoming thoughts related to the household life. [166]
The Dantabhūmi-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel continue with satipa��hāna
practice undertaken without thinking certain thoughts. The Pāli editions differ on the
nature of these thoughts, as some editions speak of not thinking thoughts related to sensuality, while others instruct not to think thoughts related to the four objects of satipa��hāna practice, that is, body, feelings, mental states, and dharmas. [167]


166 Ps IV 199,12 explains that the expression “habits [related to] the household life” (cf. [[MN125]] at MN III
136,16) refers to habits based on the [enjoyment of] the five sensual pleasures, gehasitasīlānan ti pañcakāmagu�anissitasīlāna�. With the removal of the hindrances, such concern with the five types of
sensual pleasure would have been already left behind.
167 Ee-MN III 136,21 and Se-MN III 269,16 instruct, in relation to contemplation of the body: “do not think
a thought related to the body”, mā ca kāyūpasa�hita� vitakka� vitakkesi, and continue in the same way
for the remaining three satipa��hānas by enjoining mā vedanūpasa�hita� vitakka� ... mā cittūpasa�hita� vitakka� ... mā dhammūpasa�hita� vitakka� vitakkesi. B [e] -MN III 175,20 and C [e] -MN III 316,16
instead instruct in all four cases: “do not think a thought related to sensuality”, mā ca kāmūpasamhita�
vitakka� vitakkesi. The Pañcavi�śatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā in Dutt 1934/2000: 204,2 has preserved a similar instruction, which describes an undertaking of body contemplation without forming any
thoughts associated with the body, na ca kāyasahagatān vitarkān vitarkayati; cf. also the Pratyutpannabuddhasa�mukhāvasthitasamādhi-sūtra, Harrison 1978b: 130,13 (cf. also p. 155,22), translated in


720   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


The Madhyama-āgama version instructs to avoid thoughts related to sensuality when
contemplating the body and to avoid thoughts that are “against the Dharma” or perhaps
“not rightful”, adharma, when contemplating dharmas. [168] Unfortunately, the instructions
for contemplation of feelings and states of mind are only abbreviated in the Chinese
version, so that in these two cases it remains open to conjecture what type of thoughts
are better avoided.
The need to avoid sensual thoughts would fit the context in the Madhyama-āgama
version well, where satipa��hāna comes right after the disciple has established a basis
of moral purity. Thus, from the perspective of the Madhyama-āgama account, the present stage would be a further development of satipa��hāna contemplation with particular emphasis given to overcoming any trace of sensuality. [169]
In the Majjhima-nikāya version, in contrast, the injunction to avoid sensual thoughts
seems a little out of place, as here satipa��hāna takes place after the five hindrances, including the first hindrance of sensual desire, have already been removed. For satipa��hāna to take place at such a point, the injunction to avoid any type of thought in relation to the object of satipa��hāna practice would fit the context better, thereby leading
to a level of thought-free mindfulness that can serve as a foundation for the subsequent
development of the jhānas.
The Madhyama-āgama version compares this stage of satipa��hāna to the elephant
trainer’s instruction to the forest elephant to lie down and get up, to go forward and
backward, to take something up and put it down. [170] Although this stage of taming the
forest elephant is also depicted in the Dantabhūmi-sutta, the Majjhima-nikāya discourse does not relate this stage of the elephant’s training to any of the stages of the
gradual path. [171]

present discussion already appeared in Anālayo 2005c: 103-104.
169 Such practice could then be understood to lead up to satipa��hāna being “well-established” (supati��hita) to such an extent that sensual thoughts no longer arise, cf., e.g., [[SN22.80]] at SN III 93,21 and its parallel [[SA272]] at T II 72a24.

even closer relation between these instructions to the elephant and the satipa��hāna practice of being
aware and pratising clear comprehension in relation to bodily activities, described in [[MN10]] at MN I
57,5 (or [[DN22]] at DN II 292, 莫念欲相應念, 25) and [[MA98]] at T I 582b 乃至觀覺, 心, 法如法, 25, which in addition to mentioning the activi- 莫念非法相應念

The two versions continue with the attainment of the four jhānas. While the Majjhima-nikāya discourse directly approaches the second jhāna, without mentioning the first
jhāna, [172] the Madhyama-āgama version takes the first jhāna into account (see above
table 13.4). [173]
In relation to this difference, it strikes an unfamiliar note when the Dantabhūmi-sutta
presents a progression of practice that leads from satipa��hāna meditation directly to
the second jhāna, without prior attainment of the first jhāna. Although satipa��hāna can
serve as a foundation for the development of the jhānas, [174] in itself it does not constitute a form of jhāna practice. Perhaps the occurrence of the word vitakka in the passage
on satipa��hāna without thought has led to a lapse on the part of the reciter(s) of the
discourse, who continued straight away with the calming of vitakka (vitakka-vicārāna� vūpasamā), mentioned at the outset of the second jhāna formula, thereby unintentionally dropping the first jhāna in between. [175]
The Madhyama-āgama version indicates that, by attaining the four jhānas, the disciple has reached a level of mental imperturbability that is comparable to the stage of imperturbability reached in the training of the elephant. [176] The Majjhima-nikāya version
does not relate this stage of the gradual path to the training of the elephant, even though
it earlier explicitly introduced this part of the elephant’s taming as a training in “imperturbability”, a stage of training during which, according to the description given in both
versions, the elephant has to remain unmoved even when being put in a situation that
resembles an actual fight. [177]
The Madhyama-āgama version explains that the imperturbability reached by the disciple also covers external circumstances, such as being able to bear hunger and thirst,
mosquitoes and gadflies, the vicissitudes of the climate, unpleasant words, and disease, [178] just as the elephant, on reaching imperturbability, was able to endure the blows
and noise of a battle situation. The Dantabhūmi-sutta later on does take up the disciple’s ability in endurance, although without relating it to the elephant’s endurance. [179]


ing a forest elephant and the gradual path is a central topic of both discourses, it seems probable that [[MN125]] lost this interrelation during the process of transmission.
172 [[MN125]] at MN III 136,26. Notably, Ee also does not mention the fourth jhāna, although the same is

174 The foundational role of satipa��hāna for deeper levels of concentration can be seen, e.g., in [[DN18]] at

722   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


The Madhyama-āgama discourse concludes by declaring that a disciple, who in this
way patiently bears up with difficulties, has reached a superb degree of taming and become a supreme field of merit, comparable to an elephant who, by reaching a superb
degree of taming, has become worthy of being put into service by a king.
In its account of the training of the elephant, the Majjhima-nikāya version similarly
indicates that after mastering the stage of imperturbability the elephant has become
worthy of being put into service by a king. [180] Otherwise, the Majjhima-nikāya discourse
proceeds quite differently, since before turning to the disciple’s ability to bear up with
various vicissitudes, it describes how the disciple attains the three higher knowledges
(see above table 13.4). [181]

MN III 137  The Dantabhūmi-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel agree in concluding their
account by comparing a young, middle aged, or elder monk, who passes away untamed,
to a young, middle aged, or old elephant, who passes away untamed, followed by applying the same image to the corresponding cases of tamed monks or elephants. [182] In
keeping with the different compass of the training of the disciple in each version, the
Madhyama-āgama version simply speaks of a disciple who is well trained, [183] while the
Majjhima-nikāya version speaks of a disciple who has destroyed the influxes. [184]


180 [[MN125]] at MN III 133,28: rājaraho rājabhoggo.
181 In regard to this difference, it does strike a somewhat unusual note to find [[MA198]] praising the disciple’s superior degree of taming without in any way relating such taming to the development of liberating wisdom. From this perspective, [[MN125]] would be more in accord with the general tendency of an
account of the disciple’s training in the discourses to culminate in awakening. In the present case, however, the topic of both versions is how a disciple by dint of diligent practice reaches unification of the
mind. From this perspective, it would make sense to only give an account of the disciple’s training until
the attainment of the fourth jhāna, with which the development of unification of the mind has been accomplished. The presentation in [[MA198]] would also receive support from [[AN4.114]] at AN II 117,31
and [[AN5.140]] at AN III 163,28, which compare qualities of a trained elephant to qualities of a disciple.
These two discourses describe how a disciple overcomes unwholesome thoughts and develops the ability to bear patiently the vicissitudes of climate, etc., an ability they compare to an elephant’s ability to
bear patiently a battle situation. [[AN4.114]] and [[AN5.140]] continue by comparing a disciple who swiftly
approaches liberation to the elephant’s ability to approach swiftly any place that the trainer wants it to
go to. From the perspective of these two discourses, the stages of taming an elephant described in [[MN125]] and its parallel only illustrate the stages that lead up to the point when the disciple is ready to approach liberation, but do not correspond to his actual attainment of awakening. The actual attainment of
realization, judging from [[AN4.114]] and [[AN5.140]] would correspond to the elephant swiftly going to
whatever place he is being told to go, something not mentioned in the description of the elephant’s training in [[MN125]] or [[MA198]] From the perspective of transmission, it could more easily be imagined that
a reciter supplied the ‘missing’ attainment of the three higher knowledges to an account of the gradual
path, than to assume that the higher knowledges were lost. Since already at an earlier point [[MN125]] appears to have been expanded along the lines of a full account of the gradual path, it would not be surprising if the same should have happened also at this point.

[[MN126]] Bhūmija _**-**_ sutta

The Bhūmija-sutta, the “discourse to Bhūmija”, examines if an aspiration is required
for the holy life to bear fruit. This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama. [185]
Parts of the introductory narration to this discourse appear to also have been preserved
in a Sanskrit fragment. [186]
The Bhūmija-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel begin by reporting that the monk
Bhūmija visited Prince Jayasena. [187] According to both versions, Prince Jayasena wanted
to know the opinion of Bhūmija’s teacher on whether the fruitfulness of living the holy
life depends on making an aspiration. The two versions present this proposal in the tetralemma form, by distinguishing between:

 - making an aspiration,

 - making no aspiration,

 - making both an aspiration and no aspiration,

 - neither making an aspiration nor no aspiration.
They differ in as much as in the Majjhima-nikāya version the four possibilities of this
tetralemma are concerned with the outcome that no fruit is produced, whereas in the
Madhyama-āgama version the tetralemma is concerned with the result that a fruit will
be produced.
The use of the tetralemma scheme in both versions is to some extent puzzling, since
it is difficult to imagine how someone makes an aspiration and at the same time makes


185 The parallel is [[MA173]] at T I 709c-711b and agrees with [[MN126]] on the location and on taking the
name of its main protagonist, Bhūmija/, as its title. On [[MA173]] cf. also Minh Chau 1964/1991:
69-70. The Ekottarika-āgama list of eminent disciples reckons Bhūmija as outstanding for never being
separated from his three robes (according to Nissaggiya Pācittiya rule 2 at Vin III 198,22, it is an offence for a monk to be separated from any of his three robes over night, a regulation found similarly in
the other Vinayas, cf. Pachow 1955: 98) and for being content with food, [[EA4.3]] at T II 557b29:
(literally being “peaceful in regard to food”). The A�guttara-nikāya does not include
Bhūmija in its list of eminent disciples.
186 SHT VIII 1919Bw-z (p. 100, identified in Skilling 2001b: 249). SHT VIII 1919Bw agrees with [[MN126]]
and [[MA173]] on the location of the discourse. Instead of Prince Jayasena, however, SHT VIII 1919Bz
speaks of Abhaya, which makes the identification of this fragment as a parallel to [[MN125]] and [[MA173]]
uncertain. Skilling 2001b: 249 comments 浮彌 that “the fragment cannot be identified with certainty ... although there seems to be a chance that Jayasena and Abhaya denote the same person”.
187 While [[MN126]] at MN III 138,4 simply reports that Bhūmija went to Prince Jayasena’s place and sat
down, [[MA173]] at T I 710a1 relates that Bhūmija had been on his way into town to collect alms but then
had changed his mind and decided to rather pay a visit to the prince. [[MA173]] at T I 710a5 also depicts 守持
三衣不離, Prince Jayasena’s behaviour in more detail, reporting that he respectfully welcomed Bhūmija by getting 食息
up, arranging his clothes so as to bare one shoulder and holding his hand in a gesture of reverence towards Bhūmija, followed by inviting him to sit down. According to Ps IV 199,20, Bhūmija was the
uncle of Prince Jayasena, in which case it would indeed have been appropriate for the prince to show a
more respectful behaviour than he had displayed according to [[MN125]] and [[MA198]] when meeting the
novice Aciravata. Regarding the rendering of the name of the prince given in [[MA173]] at T I 710a4 as
, the Madhyama-āgama edition p. 1555 note 9 notes that this suggests an original like
Jīvasena instead of Jayasena.

no aspiration, or else how someone neither makes an aspiration nor no aspiration. [188]
The commentary suggests that to make an aspiration and make no aspiration refers to
someone who at times makes an aspiration and at other times makes no aspiration. [189]
On adopting this commentarial explanation, one would still be at a loss to explain the
other alternative, where someone neither makes an aspiration nor makes no aspiration.
According to the Majjhima-nikāya account, Bhūmija replied that he would expect the
Buddha to state that rightly living the holy life will be fruitful independent of an aspiration. [190] The prince was pleased with this reply, concluding that on making such a statement the Buddha was superior to other teachers. The two versions record that Prince
Jayasena was so pleased that he invited Bhūmija for a meal, according to the Majjhima-nikāya version he went so far as to offer Bhūmija the food that had been prepared
for himself. [191] The Madhyama-āgama version additionally reports that after the meal
Bhūmija delivered a talk on the Dharma that satisfied and pleased the prince. [192]

MN III 139  According to both versions, Bhūmija reported his conversation with Prince Jayasena
to the Buddha. [193] Having heard Bhūmija’s report, the Buddha explained that a holy life
undertaken by developing the wrong path factors will be fruitless, [194] independent of an
aspiration, just as one will not obtain oil by pressing sand, milk by milking a cow’s
horn, butter by churning water, or fire by rubbing wet sticks. On developing the right
factors of the noble eightfold path, however, the holy life will be fruitful, independent
of an aspiration, just as oil, milk, butter, and fire can be obtained by adopting the proper methods for producing them. [195] The two versions present these similes in a different sequence (see table 13.5).


188 [[MN126]] at MN III 138,15: āsañce anāsañ ce pi karitvā ... n’ ev’ āsa� nānāsañ ce pi karitvā and [[MA173]] at T I 710a14: . The idea of making an aspiration recurs in the Chāndogya Upani�ad stanza 7:14:2 in Radhakrishnan 1953/1992: 481 (noted by Neumann 1896/1995: 1141
note 452), according to which, by making an aspiration, all desires will reach fulfilment, āśayāsya sarve kāmā� sam�dhyanti. Quite possibly some idea similar to this proposition would be implicit in Prince
Jayasena’s inquiry.
189 Ps IV 199,22: āsañ ca anāsañ cā ti, kālena āsa� kālena anāsa�; cf. also Hoffman 1982: 333.
190 In [[MA173]] at T I 710a18 he merely repeats the words used by the prince. Since such a reply would be
meaningless and would hardly have evoked approval, this appears to be a textual error, where the specification that the holy life is lived “rightly”,, has accidentally made its way from Bhūmija’s reply to
the prince’s question that elicited this reply. For a similar case cf. above p. 508 note 323.
191 [[MN126]] at MN III 139, 或願無願, 13 specifies that the prince served Bhūmija from his own dish of milk rice, 或非有願非無願 saken’ eva thālipākena parivisi.
192 [[MA173]] at T I 710a27.
193 While in [[MA173]] at T I 710b1 Bhūmija merely reports the conversation, in [[MN126]] at MN III 139,29
he inquires whether he has presented the Buddha’s position correctly, which the Buddha confirms.
194 [[MA173]] at T I 710b5 literally speaks of “wrong view, wrong view concentration”, . In
analogy with [[MN126]] at MN III 140,7, which lists all eight path-factors, I assume the passage in [[MA173]] to be an abbreviation of the same, i.e.,, where the implications of “wrong view
concentration”,, could intend “concentration [based on] wrong view 正 ”, similar to a formulation
found in [[MA64]] at T I 503c9: .

According to the Bhūmija-sutta and its parallel, the Buddha told Bhūmija that, if he
would have employed these similes, the prince would have acquired confidence in him
and also shown his confidence. [196] Bhūmija replied that he had never heard these similes
before, so that it could not really be expected of him to make use of them. [197]
The Buddha’s suggestion is slightly puzzling, since in both versions Bhūmija’s explanation had inspired confidence in the prince, so much so that he treated Bhūmija to
a meal. This suggests that the prince had understood the point made by Bhūmija, even
though the matter had not been illustrated by similes.
A similar remark by the Buddha is found also in the Dantabhūmi-sutta, where it fits
the context better, since in this case the exposition given by another Buddhist monk to
Prince Jayasena had not convinced the prince. [198]

holy life and illustrating it with the four corresponding positive versions of the same similes (i.e., pressing sesame to get oil, milking a cow’s udder to get milk, churning curd to get butter, and rubbing dry
sticks to get fire). [[MA173]] instead takes up each image from its negative and positive side and applies
it to the fruitless and the fruitful holy life, before proceeding to the next image. The similes of trying to
get oil from sand and ghee from water recur in T 203.113 at T IV 493c7, translated in Willemen 1994:
228, while the image of milking a cow’s horn can also be found in the Saundaranandakāvya 16:50 in
Johnston 1928: 118,2.
196 [[MN126]] at MN III 144,16 explains that if Bhūmija had spoken these four similes to the prince, “it
would not have been surprising if Prince Jayasena had developed confidence in you and, being confident, would have acted in such a way as to express his confidence”, anacchariya� te jayaseno rājakumāro pasīdeyya, pasanno ca te pasannākāra� kareyyā ti. According to [[MA173]] at T I 710b3, even
before delivering the four similes the Buddha asked: “why did you not think of expounding the four
similes to the prince”, ? After completing his exposition, according to [[MA173]] at T I 711b10 the Buddha explained that if Bhūmija had delivered these four similes to the prince,
“on having heard them, the prince would certainly have been greatly pleased and would have offered
you his support”,, followed by suggesting that the prince would
have supported Bhūmija for all his life with the four requisites.
197 According to [[MN126]] at MN III 144,20, Bhūmija explained that the similes were anacchariyā pubbe
assutapubbā. In [[MA173]] at T I 711b12 he similarly states that “before I had never heard these four
similes”, . Von Hinüber 1970/1994: 22-23 explains that “an-acchariyā ... can be
derived from an-ak�ar-ikā” and suggests to render the expression as “unarticulated before, unheard
before”.

726   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


The Dantabhūmi-sutta and the Bhūmija-sutta show several similarities:

       - both have as their protagonist a monk who does not feature prominently in other
discourses,

       - this monk has a discussion with Prince Jayasena and later reports this discussion
to the Buddha,

       - this discussion causes the Buddha to deliver a series of illustrative similes.
From the perspective of oral transmission, the similarity between the two discourses
could have caused the reciters to apply, perhaps quite accidentally, the Dantabhūmisutta passage, in which the Buddha reproves the monk for failing to convince Prince
Jayasena, to the Bhūmija-sutta as well. [199] Such an application would then have to have
occurred at a relatively early stage in the transmission of the discourse, as it is now found
in the Majjhima-nikāya and Madhyama-āgama versions.


[[MN127]] Anuruddha-sutta

The Anuruddha-sutta, the “discourse by Anuruddha”, takes up differences between
various types of mental liberation and various devas. This discourse has a parallel in
the Madhyama-āgama. [200]

MN III 145   The Anuruddha-sutta begins by reporting that the carpenter Pañcaka�ga invited Anuruddha together with three other monks for a meal. [201] The Madhyama-āgama account

199 Alternatively, even though Bhūmija’s exposition was basically correct and did convince the prince, perhaps he had not explored the situation to its fullest potential. In support of this alternative explanation,
another discourse concerned with Bhūmija could be taken up. According to [[SN12.25]] at SN II 38,6,
Bhūmija had approached Sāriputta and inquired about the Buddha’s position in regard to recluses and
Brahmins who propose happiness and pain to be caused by oneself, by an external agency, by both, or
by neither. The Chinese and Sanskrit fragment versions of this discourse report that, before approaching
Sāriputta with this question, Bhūmija had been confronted with this query by heterodox practitioners.
In reply, he had proclaimed that, according to his teacher, pleasure and pain were conditionally arisen
phenomena, [[SA343]] at T II 93c14: “they are produced through dependent arising”,, fragment
[[SN474]] folio 15V9 in Tripā�hī 1962: 48: pratītyasamutpanna� ... bhagavatā sukhadukha� prajñaptam
(which ibid. note 13 suggests to correct to sukhadu�kha�). On hearing this reply, the heterodox practitioners had left without further ado. Thus, according to the Chinese and Sanskrit versions of this discourse, on this other occasion Bhūmija had also been unable to present the teachings convincingly. In
this particular case, his brief reference to conditionality would not have been sufficient as an explanation, as his visitors would have been unfamiliar with the early Buddhist conception of the nature of conditionality and thus unable to appreciate fully the implications of the reply given by Bhūmija. Hence in
this case, too, Bhūmija’s reply was correct, yet, if he had explained a little more, his visitors might have
understood better.
200 The parallel is [[MA79]] at T I 549b-551c, which agrees with [[MN127]] on the location and 從緣起生 has the title “discourse on the existence of superior devas”, . On [[MA79]] cf. also Minh Chau 1964/1991: 146.
201 According to [[MN127]] at MN III 145,5, Pañcaka�ga told his messenger to ask the monks to come pagevatara, which Horner 1959: 190 and Ñā�amoli 1995/2005: 1002 translate as “punctually”. According
to [[MA79]] at T I 549b20, the monks had been asked to come “early”, . For a householder to invite
monks and then tell them to be punctual strikes an unusual note, whereas to ask them to come early
because he has work to attend to would be more natural. In line with the sense suggested by the Chi有勝天經
早


Chapter 13 Suññata-vagga                                      -  727


differs in as much as its protagonist is not the carpenter Pañcaka�ga, but rather Isidatta,
one of the chamberlains of King Pasenadi. [202] The ensuing meal offering provided the
occasion for asking Anuruddha if “immeasurable” liberation of the mind (appamā�ā
cetovimutti) was the same as liberation of the mind that has “become great” (mahaggatā cetovimutti). [203]
According to both versions, Anuruddha corrected the assumption of his host that
these two mental liberations have the same meaning, explaining that “immeasurable”
liberation of the mind stands for practising the brahmavihāras, [204] whereas liberation of
the mind that has “become great” refers to pervading an area of a size ranging from

[the shade provided by] a single tree root to the whole earth with one’s meditation object, which could be quite different from the brahmavihāras. [205]
The Anuruddha-sutta and its parallel differ in the sequence of their presentation. The
Majjhima-nikāya version first examines the immeasurable liberation of the mind, and
then takes up the liberation of the mind that has become great, whereas the Madhyamaāgama version adopts the opposite sequence (see below table 13.6). [206]
The Anuruddha-sutta next takes up four types of heavenly rebirth, distinguishing between devas that are endowed with:


nese translation, pageva + the comparative suffix ºtara could also be translated as “earlier”, in the sense
of asking the monks to come earlier than they would usually come.

Isidatta, with rendering “chamberlain”, rendering “sage” (isi), while according to ibid. should
rather be (a confusion between these two characters would be facilitated by their similar Early Middle Chinese pronunciation, cf. Pulleyblank 1991: 380 and 382), on which assumption, “to give”,
would render datta (cf. also the Madhyama-āgama edition p. 667 note 6).
203 The narration in [[MA79]] that leads up to this question is more detailed, as according to [[MA79]] at T I
549b6 the messenger was to approach first the Buddha and inquire after the latter’s health, before approaching Anuruddha. After describing the actual exchange that took place between the Buddha and
the messenger, [[MA79]] at T I 549c3 continues by reporting that Kaccāna, who was present when Anuruddha was invited for the meal, suggested that Anuruddha should accept the invitation. [[MA79]] at T I
549c19 also narrates in detail the respectful reception of Anuruddha (and implicitly of his companions), 仙餘財主
when they arrived for the meal. While in [[MN127]] at MN III 145, 財主 仙 22 Pañcaka�ga first offered the food, 餘
according to [[MA79]] at T I 549c 與 26, when Anuruddha arrived, his host immediately put his question and
the offering of the meal took place only after the discussion was completed, cf. [[MA79]] at T I 551c 與 16.
Another difference is that, while according to [[MN127]] at MN III 145, 佛光 29 elder monks, therā bhikkhū,
had recommended to develop these two liberations of the mind, according to [[MA79]] at T I 549c29 this
recommendation came from recluses and Brahmins.
204 [[MN43]] at MN I 297,20 also identifies appamā�ā cetovimutti with the brahmavihāras; cf. also the similar distinction between these two types of liberation of the mind in the Yogācārabhūmi, Delhey 2009a:
189,5 and T 1579 at T XXX 338a3.
205 Besides a possible difference in the meditation object, another difference could also be that a mind that
has become great may pervade areas of various size, whereas a mind that has become immeasurable
pervades a quite literally no longer measurable area. That the latter would be superior to the former suggests itself from a listing of four progressively subtler types of saññā in [[AN10.29]] at AN V 63,17,
where mahaggata precedes appamā�[[AN206]] [[MN127]] at MN III 146,13 and [[MA79]] at T I 550a9.

       - a limited radiance,

       - a boundless radiance,

       - a defiled radiance,

       - a pure radiance. [207]
The Madhyama-āgama version instead examines three types of heavenly rebirth, distinguishing between devas that are endowed with:

       - radiance,

       - pure radiance,

       - all-pervasive pure radiance. [208]
The two versions agree that, when these different devas come together, their radiance
is the same, comparable to numerous lamps placed together in a single room.

MN III 148  The Anuruddha-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel explain that those devas delight wherever they are, comparable to a fly that delights wherever it settles down. [209]
While according to the Majjhima-nikāya version these devas do not have the thought
that their existence is permanent, [210] according to the Madhyama-āgama version they do
not think of the realm where they have arisen as “mine”. [211]
Another difference is that, while the Majjhima-nikāya discourse first describes the
similarity of the radiance when the devas congregate (illustrated with the simile of the
lamps) and only then turns to their mental attitude towards their existence (illustrated
with the simile of the fly), the Madhyama-āgama discourse covers these two topics in
the opposite sequence (see table 13.6).
Both versions report that the monk Kaccāna intervened at this point, asking Anuruddha why devas that have arisen in the same realm differ from each other. [212] While in


207 [[MN127]] at MN III 147,17 lists parittābhā devā, appamā�ābhā devā, sa�kili��hābhā devā, and parisuddhābhā devā (C [e] -MN III 334,40 and S [e] -MN III 287,19: sa�kili��hābhā). The first two could refer to two
sub-realms of the Brahmā world of the second jhāna, cf. [[MN120]] at MN III 102,27.
208 [[MA79]] at T I 550b4: . According to Hirakawa 1997: 1155, stands for
the śubhak�tsna deva, representative of the Brahmā world that corresponds to the third absorption, cf.
also Soothill 1937/2000: 414.
209 A minor difference in relation to this image is that, according to [[MN127]] at MN III 148,14, the flies are
“being carried away on a carrying pole or a basket”, kājena vā pi�akena vā harīyamānāna�, whereas
according to [[MA79]] at T I 550b7 the fly is “on a piece of meat”, . The commentary at Ps IV
202,7 explains that such a carrying pole is employed for the purpose of carrying various victuals,
among them also meat, so that the idea behind the two versions of the simile would be quite similar.
210 [[MN127]] at MN III 148,11: “this [existence] of ours is permanent, stable, and eternal”, ida� amhāka�

212 The Pāli editions vary on his name. While Ee-MN III 148,22 and Se-MN III 289,10 refer to this monk as
Abhiya Kaccāna, B [e] -MN III 187,22 and C [e] -MN III 336,26 speak of Sabhiya Kaccāna. The name sabhiya was, according to Th-a II 113,29, given to an (apparently different) Sabhiya because his mother had
given birth to him out on the road, in an inn, antarāmagge sabhāya� vijāyi, ten’ assa sabhiyo tveva

the Majjhima-nikāya version his question takes up the difference between devas of limited radiance and devas of boundless radiance, [213] in the Madhyama-āgama version his
question is about differences in subtlety among radiant devas. [214]
In reply, Anuruddha explained that devas reborn in the same realm differ due to the
different size of the area that they had been able to pervade with their meditation practice in their former existence. [215]

According to the Majjhima-nikāya version, Kaccāna asked the same question again   MN III 151
about devas with a defiled radiance or a pure radiance, [216] while according to the Madhyama-āgama version he inquired about differences in subtlety among devas of pure radiance. [217] The two versions agree that the difference between these devas was also due
to their former lifetime’s meditation practice. The Majjhima-nikāya version explains


at T III 832b5, explains that he received his name because he was “born inside of the district”,,
which Beal 1875: 281 understands to mean the he was born in the “district-hall” (according to Mathews
1963: 400, however, means just “district”). [[MA79]] at T I 549c3 speaks of, “real” Kaccāna, which the Madhyama-āgama edition p. 668 note 1 relates to, the protagonist
of [[SA959]] at T II 244c25, a discourse counterpart to an occurrence of Sabhiya Kaccāna in [[SN44.11]] at
SN IV 401,13.
213 [[MN127]] at MN III 149,1 contrasts devatā parittābhā with devatā appamā�ābhā.
214 [[MA79]] at T I 550b19 examines “radiant devas”,, that differ in their respective “subtlety”,, a
character that often renders sukhuma or sūk�ma. It is also noteworthy that in both versions Anuruddha
and Kaccāna address each other in the way that according to [[DN16]] at DN II 154,8 and [[EA42.3]] at T II
752c17 (translated in Bareau 1987: 28) was instituted only immediately before the Buddha’s demise, 在縣內生
with Kaccāna addressing Anuruddha as bhante/, while Anuruddha in reply uses āvuso/, cf.
also above p. 212. As a description of a conversation that according to both versions took place during 縣 真迦旃延
the Buddha’s lifetime, this would be an anachronism. For this discourse to be located after the Bud 佛光 詵陀迦旃延所  dha’s demise would, however, conflict with the introductory reference to the Buddha staying at Jeta’s
Grove, found in [[MN127]] at MN III 144,25 and [[MA79]] at T I 549b5.
215 While [[MN127]] at MN III 149,6 simply speaks of “dwelling having pervaded and resolved as ‘become
great’”, mahaggatan ti pharitvā adhimuccitvā viharati 光天, [[MA79]] at T I 550b26 speaks of “making the 妙
mental resolve to put into operation perception of light, mentally creating the acme of perception of
light”, . In its recapitulation, [[MA79]] at T I 550c28 adds that
practice undertaken in this way can be refined or crude,, a point [[MA79]] at T I 551b3 and
at T I 551c4 makes also in relation to the subsequent examination of the remaining two types of 尊者 賢者 deva.
216 [[MN127]] at MN III 151,6 contrasts devatā sa�kili��hābhā with devatā parisuddhābhā.
217 [[MA79]] at T I 551a2 inquires after the respective “subtlety”,, of the “pure radiant devas”, .

that the inferior devas had not been able to overcome bodily inertia and the hindrances
of sloth-and-torpor and restlessness-and-worry. [218] The Madhyama-āgama version does
not mention any hindrance, but simply indicates that the inferior types of deva did not
fully develop their meditation practice. [219]
The Majjhima-nikāya discourse illustrates this case with the example of an oil lamp
whose wick and oil are not pure, due to which the oil lamp burns only dimly. The Madhyama-āgama version uses a different image at this point, as it compares the differences
among pure radiant devas to various lotus flowers, some of which remain in the water
while others rise above the surface of the water. [220]
At this point the examination of the relation between meditation practice and subsequent rebirth in the Majjhima-nikāya discourse has taken into account all of the four
types of deva mentioned in its version, the devas with a limited radiance, with a boundless radiance, with a defiled radiance, and with a pure radiance. In the Madhyama-āgama version, however, the examination so far has only covered two out of its three types
of deva, namely the radiant devas and the pure radiant devas. So the Madhyama-āgama
version continues by examining differences to be found among devas that are of an allpervasive pure radiance.
The Madhyama-āgama discourse relates such differences to the influence of the hindrances sloth-and-torpor and restless-and-worry during former life meditation practice,
hindrances the Majjhima-nikāya version had mentioned in its discussion of devas with
a defiled radiance or a pure radiance. [221] To illustrate the effect of these two hindrances,
the Madhyama-āgama version makes use of the same image of an oil lamp found earlier
in the Majjhima-nikāya version.

MN III 152  According to the Majjhima-nikāya account, Kaccāna remarked that Anuruddha had
described those devas as if he had personal experience of them. Anuruddha explained
that he had personally met those devas, so that he indeed spoke from personal experience. Before giving this reply, Anuruddha noted that Kaccāna’s remark was discourteous, perhaps because it was made in an ironic tone. [222] The Majjhima-nikāya discourse


218 [[MN127]] at MN III 151,15: “bodily inertia has not been fully allayed, sloth-and-torpor have not been
fully removed, and restlessness-and-worry have not been fully dispelled”, kāyadu��hullam pi na suppa�ippasaddha� hoti, thīnamiddham pi na susamūhata� hoti, uddhaccakukkuccam pi na suppa�ivinīta� hoti (B [e] -MN III 190,7: thinamiddham, S [e] -MN III 293,1: supa�ivinīta�).
219 [[MA79]] at T I 551a10: “they did not cultivate this concentration, did not practise it, did not widely [undertake] it, did not fully put it into operation”, .
220 [[MA79]] at T I 551a14+25. The same image recurs in other Pāli discourse, cf., e.g., [[DN14]] at DN II 38,24,
[[MN26]] at MN I 169,10, [[MN85]] at MN II 93,25, and [[SN6.1]] at SN I 138,8 (or SN [2] 172 at SN [2] I 302,3).
221 [[MA79]] at T I 551b14, which does not mention the bodily inertia listed in [[MN127]] at MN III 151,15.

the respective visitor had just acknowledged some accomplishment of the Buddha. In [[MN36]] the debater
Saccaka stated his belief that the Buddha was developed in body and mind; in [[AN3.60]] a Brahmin proclaimed that the Buddha must be endowed with supernormal powers, telepathic knowledge, and the

concludes with Kaccāna turning to the host and congratulating him on being able to
hear such an exposition.
The Madhyama-āgama version proceeds differently, as it begins with this comment
by Kaccāna to the host. Anuruddha then explained that there were even more devas
whom he had not mentioned, but had personally met. [223] Thus, in the Madhyama-āgama
version there seem to be nothing inappropriate in Kaccāna’s behaviour. Unlike the
Majjhima-nikāya version, the Madhyama-āgama version concludes with the delight of
the host and the assembled monks. [224]


[[MN128]] Upakkilesa-sutta

The Upakkilesa-sutta, the “discourse on [minor] defilements”, records the Buddha’s
attempt to settle a quarrel among the monks at Kosambī and his subsequent visit to another group of monks, a visit during which the Buddha gave a detailed description of
various mental obstacles to the development of deeper stages of concentration. This
discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama and a partial parallel in the Ekottarika-āgama. [225] The first part of the Upakkilesa-sutta, which records the Buddha’s attempt to settle the Kosambī quarrel, has also counterparts in the Dharmaguptaka, Mahāsā�ghika, Mahīśāsaka, (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda and Theravāda Vinayas. [226] Parts of the
Upakkilesa-sutta have also been preserved in Sanskrit and Uighur fragments, [227] and in
a discourse quotation in Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya,
extant in Tibetan. [228]


ability to teach how to develop the mind; and in [[AN4.35]] a Brahmin expressed his belief that the Buddha was acting for the benefit of mankind, had control over his mind, was able to attain the jhānas, and
had destroyed the influxes. In all these cases, the reply given by the Buddha gives the impression as if
the earlier statements by his visitors were made in an ironic manner.

refers to [[EA24.8]] as “Long Lifespan”,, the name of the king put to death by King Brahmadatta.
[[MA72]] and [[EA24.8]] agree with [[MN128]] on locating the discourse at Kosambī. For remarks on [[MA72]]

arising of mental defilements, cf. V2: avabhāso-[nta]rhi(to), V5: (avabh)[ā]sa� sa�jānāmi da(r)śa(na�

732   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


MN III 153  The Upakkilesa-sutta and its parallels begin by recording that the Buddha attempted
to stop a quarrel that had arisen among the Kosambī monks. [229] According to the Madhyama-āgama and Ekottarika-āgama versions, in order to inspire the Kosambī monks to
forgiveness, the Buddha delivered the tale of Prince Dīghāvu’s patience. [230] This tale reports that, wishing to avenge the cruel killing of his father by King Brahmadatta, Prince
Dīghāvu had under cover enrolled in the services of King Brahmadatta. When an occasion arose to carry out his plan, however, he remembered his father’s advice to be patient and decided to spare King Brahmadatta’s life.
The accounts of the Kosambī quarrel in the Dharmaguptaka, Mahāsā�ghika, Mahīśāsaka, (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda, and Theravāda Vinayas, [231] together with records of the same
incident in two Pāli Jātaka tales and a Chinese Udāna-(varga) tale, [232] agree with the
Madhyama-āgama and Ekottarika-āgama versions that the Buddha related this tale to
the quarrelling monks at Kosambī.

MN III 154  When the monks of Kosambī were unwilling to follow his advice, the Buddha decided to leave them. [233] According to the Majjhima-nikāya and Madhyama-āgama versions, as well as the Dharmaguptaka, Mahīśāsaka, (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda, and Theravāda
Vinayas, the Buddha spoke a set of stanzas on this occasion. [234]


229 On this quarrel cf. also above p. 204. How the Buddha took the quarrelling Kosambī monks to task is
also described in [[MN48]] according to which he taught them six factors conducive to communal harmony. [[MN48]] at MN I 325,28 ends by reporting that the monks delighted in what the Buddha had said,
so that this discourse gives the impression that he had been successful in settling the quarrel. Perhaps
the Kosambī monks were at first delighted with the Buddha’s instruction, but after he had left them, their
quarrel nevertheless flared up again. On this interpretation, the Buddha’s intervention described in [[MN128]] and its parallel would have taken place at a later point in time, after the events described in [[MN48]]
230 According to the version of this tale found in the Theravāda Vinaya, the father’s name was Dīghīti and
his son’s name Dīghāvu, cf. Vin I 342,6 and Vin I 343,30. Most of the Chinese versions of this tale give
the name of the father as “Long Lifespan”,, corresponding to dīgha + āyu, and the name of the
son as “Long Life”,, corresponding to dīgha + jāti, cf. [[MA72]] at T I 532c16 and T I 534a3, [[EA24.8]] at T II 626c5 and T II 627a29, T 152.10 at T III 5a20, T 161 at T III 386a8, T 212 at T IV 693b26
and T IV 694a11, and T 1421 at T XXII 159a15 and T XXII 159b7. T 1428 at T XXII 880b19 and T
XXII 880c26 instead introduces the father as “Long Life”,, and gives the name of the son simply
as “Long”, . T 152.10 at T III 6a14 and T 161 at T III 387b21 identify the father as a former life of
the Buddha and the son as a former life of Ānanda. Fragments of a version of this tale can also be found
in SHT X 3306 (p. 36). For a representation of this tale on a dome-slab in Nāgārjuniko��a cf. Ahir

In spite of some differences in formulation and sequence, the stanzas in the Upakkilesa-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel touch on the same themes. Thus, both
versions highlight that anger can never be overcome by anger, but only by abstaining
from anger, a point also made in the Vinaya versions of these stanzas. [235] The same two
discourses and the Dharmaguptaka, Mahīśāsaka, (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda, and Theravāda
Vinayas contrast the ability of thieves to act in concord with the inability of the monks
to live in harmony. [236] In the Upakkilesa-sutta, its Madhyama-āgama parallel, and in the
(Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda and Theravāda Vinayas, the verses spoken by the Buddha culminate in three stanzas in praise of a solitary life style. [237]
According to the Upakkilesa-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel, after leaving
the Kosambī monks the Buddha went to visit the monk Bhagu. [238] On being asked by
the Buddha if he was living at ease, Bhagu affirmed that this was the case. According


Dutt 1984b: 182,13, and Vin I 349,25; for a more detailed study of these stanzas cf. Dietz 1998. [[EA24.8]]
at T II 629a8 records only a single stanza spoken by the Buddha as part of his third attempt to convince
the monks to stop quarrelling, a stanza that recommends developing loving kindness instead of disputing. Vin I 350,15 continues similar to [[MN128]] by reporting the Buddha’s visit to Bhagu and to Anuruddha, without, however, giving a full record of the instruction that, according to [[MN128]] at MN III 157,20,
the Buddha thereon delivered to Anuruddha and his companions.

734   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


to the Madhyama-āgama account, the Buddha further inquired in what way Bhagu
lived at ease, to which Bhagu replied by describing his diligent meditation practice. [239]
Thus, while the Majjhima-nikāya version presents Bhagu simply as a well-behaved
monk who lives on his own, the Madhyama-āgama depicts him as a serious meditator.
In this way, the present passage seems to be yet another instance of a tendency in Chinese
Āgama discourses to give emphasis to the practice of meditation. [240]
According to the Madhyama-āgama account, after leaving Bhagu the Buddha went
to live alone in a forest with only an elephant as his company. This elephant had left
the herd of elephants in order to be at ease on his own. [241]
The Mahīśāsaka and the Theravāda Vinayas also relate that, after leaving the Kosambī
monks, the Buddha dwelled in the company of an elephant that had left his herd. [242]
While in the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya this took place right after the Buddha had left the
quarrelling monks, according to the Theravāda Vinaya this happened after the Buddha
had visited Anuruddha.

MN III 157  The Upakkilesa-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama counterpart report that, on visiting
Anuruddha and his companions, the Buddha asked them about their meditative development, a part of the discourse also preserved in the discourse quotation in Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya. [243] In reply, Anuruddha described
that he and his companions experienced meditative light and saw forms, which then
disappeared again. They failed to penetrate or apprehend the ‘sign’ responsible for this. [244]

239 [[MA72]] at T I 535c26: “I day and night energetically practise the path without drowsiness, being resolved
to practise concentration continuously and to be established in the requisites of awakening (bodhipakkhiyā dhammā)”, . [[MA72]] adds that, in approval of Bhagu’s practice, the Buddha decided to give him a discourse. The expression recurs in [[SA733]] at
T II 196b15 and [[SA737]] at T II 196c25 with the further specification “seven”, introduced as an equivalent to, the seven bojjha�gas. In Ekottarika-āgama discourses, however, the expressions
or are introduced as a set of “thirty-seven”, cf., e.g., [[EA1.1]] at T II 551a4, [[EA16.4]] at T II
579c26, [[EA23.3]] at T II 612a19, [[EA26.2]] a T II 635b27, [[EA26.4]] at T II 635c21, [[EA34.5]] at T II 696c9
(cf. also [[MA120]] at T I 609c10, where the expression has a and variant reading which
turns the seven into thirty-seven). In the Pāli discourses, references to “seven” bodhipakkhiyā dhammā
can be found in [[DN27]] at DN III 97,8, It 3:4:3 at It 75,13, and It 3:5:8 at It 96,20, while in several discourses in the Indriya-sa�yutta the expression bodhipakkhiyā dhammā stands for the five faculties (cf.

Chapter 13 Suññata-vagga                                      -  735


The use of the expression ‘sign’ in the present context is to some extent ambiguous.
The Pāli word for sign is nimitta, a term that can also have a plain causal sense. On following this causal sense, the idea behind the need to ‘penetrate the sign’ would be that
Anuruddha and his companions needed to discover the ‘cause’ for the disappearance of
their meditative visions.
This way of understanding fits the context well, since in both versions the Buddha
continued by describing a set of mental obstructions that were the cause for the disappearance of these meditative visions. The Pāli commentary on the present passage in
fact takes nimitta in a causal sense. [245]
A related meaning of the same term nimitta is ‘sign’ as a ‘mark’, in the sense of the
characteristics of phenomena by which perception recognizes an object. This meaning
preserves the causal nuance, since it is due to the nimitta that recognition takes place.
In a more specific sense, such a ‘sign’ also plays a role in relation to the practice of
meditation. The use of nimitta in the sense of a meditative ‘sign’ as a causal factor in
the development of concentration comes to the fore particularly in the commentaries,
where it regularly stands for the meditative object used for entering into deeper stages
of concentration. [246]
The use of the term nimitta in a context related to the development of concentration is,
however, not confined to the commentaries, but can already be found in the discourses,
which repeatedly speak of the “sign of tranquillity”, samathanimitta, [247] or of the “sign of
concentration”, samādhinimitta. [248]
This sense of nimitta as a mental ‘sign’ or object used for the development of concentration would also fit the present context well, which describes meditative visions
and the development of concentration. At a later point of its exposition, the Upakkilesa-sutta in fact explicitly uses the term nimitta in order to refer to the vision of light
and forms that Anuruddha and his companions had been unable to stabilize, a usage
where nimitta clearly stands for a mental sign, for something that is perceived. [249]

245 Ps IV 207,13 glosses nimitta with kāra�a, thereby indicating that in the present context nimitta should
be understood as “cause”; on the term nimitta cf. also Anālayo 2003b.
246 Vism 125,1 describes the progress of concentration, based on a kasi�a object, as proceeding from a first
apperception of the meditation object, via the ability to remember and thereby mentally see this meditation object with closed eyes, the uggahanimitta, to the stage when this memory image becomes a very
bright, clear, and stable mental image, the pa�ibhāganimitta, heralding the entry into jhāna.

the “sign of form”, rūpanimitta, and to giving attention to the meditative experience of light in terms of
the “sign of light”, obhāsanimitta. Cousins 1973: 119, in the context of examining the commentarial
usage of nimitta as a mental sign that leads to deeper concentration, comments that “the most striking
evidence for the antiquity of the concept is to be found in the Upakkilesa-sutta”.


736   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


That the development of deeper stages of concentration forms a central theme in this
part of the Upakkilesa-sutta and its parallel can also be seen from the mental obstructions listed in both versions. This list of mental obstructions does not mention the first
two of the five hindrances, sensual desire and aversion. Their absence indicates that the
meditative development described in the present discourse sets in at a more advanced
stage, when these two comparatively gross mental defilements have been subdued and
a minimum degree of mental tranquillity has already been established. It is precisely at
this point, when the gross hindrances of sensual desire and aversion have been overcome and the mind becomes increasingly concentrated, that according to the Visuddhimagga’s account the mental sign, the nimitta, will manifest to the meditator. [250] Thus it
seems that the present passage covers the same phenomena described in the Visuddhimagga in terms of a nimitta that needs to be stabilized and mastered in order to be able
to attain jhāna. [251]

MN III 158  According to the Upakkilesa-sutta and its parallel, the Buddha told Anuruddha and
his companions that during the time before his awakening he similarly experienced
meditative visions of light and forms, which then again disappeared. On investigating
this phenomenon, he found out that a series of eleven mental obstructions had been responsible for the disappearance of these meditative visions. The two versions list these
mental obstructions with a few differences (see below table 13.7). [252]
The Upakkilesa-sutta and its parallel agree in listing the mental obstructions doubt,
lack of attention, sloth-and-torpor, fear, [253] elation, [254] inertia, [255] excess of energy, [256] lack
of energy, [257] and perception of diversity. [258]


250 Vism 125,32.
251 This is not the way the commentary understands this passage, however, as Ps IV 207,11 takes the expression “vision of forms” to stand for seeing forms with the divine eye, dassanañ ca rūpānan ti dibbacakkhunā rūpadassanañ ca sañjānāma. The commentarial explanation could be inspired by [[AN8.64]] at
AN IV 302,14, where to see forms and perceive lights leads to being able to converse with devas. In the
present context, however, the commentarial explanation does not seem to fit the context, pace Schlingloff 1985: 330, since the exercise of the divine eye requires the concentrative stability of the fourth jhāna, whereas in [[MN128]] and [[MA72]] the level of concentration achieved through stabilizing the vision of
lights and forms is evidently lower, leading at [[MN128]] at MN III 162,14 and [[MA72]] at T I 538c3 to
concentration with initial and sustained mental application, savitakka savicāra samādhi/,
which corresponds to the first jhāna only.
252 The overall count of eleven mental obstructions recurs in the Yogācārabhūmi, Delhey 2009a: 193,3 and
T 1579 at T XXX 338c10, which continues with detailed explanations on their respective significance.
A similar listing of upakkilesas can also be found in the Path to Liberation (Vimuttimagga/ ),
in the context of a description of the development of the divine eye, cf. T 1648 at T XXXII 444b1.

at T XXX 338c23, just speaks of obtaining two).

They differ on two of the mental obstructions that prevent stabilizing the meditative
light and forms. Where the Majjhima-nikāya version speaks of longing, its Madhyamaāgama counterpart lists conceit; [259] where the Majjhima-nikāya version mentions excessive contemplation of forms, the Madhyama-āgama version speaks of not contemplating forms. [260]
The Madhyama-āgama version also differs in as much as, according to its account,
the Buddha explained why the first obstruction of doubt arose in him. Apparently doubt
arose due to his reflection whether he might be seeing something that does not exist. [261]

255 [[MN128]] at MN III 159,15: du��hulla. [[MA72]] at T I 537a20 speaks of “body disease perception”,
, where could be rendering an equivalent to kāyadu��hulla, to which the translator may have
added in order to indicate that the point at stake was not a physical disease (in the case of the corresponding expression kāyadau��hulya in the Yogācārabhūmi, Delhey 2009a: 193,11, the Chinese version, T 1579 at T XXX 338c18, employs the rendering ). Hecker 1994: 169 notes that in sa�ghādisesa rule 3 at Vin III 128,22 and in aniyata rule 2 at Vin III 191,27 du��hulla vācā refers to speaking lewd words to a woman, and in [[SN8.2]] at SN I 187,4 (or SN [2] 210 at SN [2] I 402,8) du��hullabhā�i occurs in a set of stanzas spoken by Va�gīsa after overcoming lust in his mind (the subcommentary at B [e]  Spk-p� I 283 glosses du��hulla in this context as referring to talk that is “related to sensuality”, du��hullavacana� kāmapa�isamyuttakathā). These occurrences invest the word du��hulla with a strong nuance
of being related to sensuality (although Vin IV 31,17 explains du��hullā āpatti to stand for any grave of- 身病
想 fence, i.e. pārājika 身病 or sa�ghādisesa). In the present context, however, the nuance of sensuality would
not fit, as the word occurs in the context of a series of refined mental obstructions. While the rendering 想
in [[MA72]] is far from conclusive, it suggests the term kāyadu��hulla instead of du��hulla. The same
meaning is also reflected in the commentary at Ps IV 208, 身麁重 10, which glosses du��hulla in the present
context as “bodily inertia, bodily distress, bodily sloth”, kāyadu��hulla� kāyadaratho kāyālasiya�. The
term kāyadu��hulla recurs in [[MN64]] at MN I 435,29 and in [[MN127]] at MN III 151,15 in the context of a
development of deeper stages of concentration, which indicates that this term would fit the present
examination of stages bordering on deep concentration better than du��hulla. The term kāyadu��hulla
occurs also in Th 114 and in Vibh 352,16, where it seems to stand for some form of bodily inertia or
sloth. The idea of bodily inertia would suit the present context well, as in this part of the exposition in
[[MN128]] the obstacles appear to come in pairs that contrast opposite qualities, the preceding pair being
sloth-and-torpor in contrast to the [agitation] of fear, and the next pair being excess of energy in contrast to lack of energy. In this pair-wise presentation, the contrast to the term under discussion is provided by elation, ubbilla. Kāyadu��hulla in the sense of bodily inertia or sloth would fit as a contrast to
elation (although this argument does not hold for the different sequence in [[MA72]]). Thus, perhaps the
original treatment spoke of an equivalent to kāyadu��hulla instead of du��hulla, as suggested by the use
of in [[MA72]]
256 [[MN128]] at MN III 159,21: accāraddhaviriya (Be-MN III 197,19: accāraddhavīriya) and [[MA72]] at T II

of gripping a fly so tight that it will die. The Uighur fragments refer to a bird, cf. T II [[SN59]] 14 in von
Gabain 1954: 27, as does the Yogācārabhūmi, Delhey 2009a: 194,1 and T 1579 at T XXX 338c22, in

This statement further supports the assumption that the stages of meditation described
at this point are related to the manifestation of the mental sign, the nimitta. It is precisely the shift from the commonly experienced world of the senses to mental visions
and signs during the progress towards deeper stages of concentration that easily can
cause the arising of such doubt and uncertainty, as it entails a shift from the known
world of sensory experience to an unknown terrain consisting of purely mental visions
and experiences, something that from the perspective of normal experience does not
really seem to exist.

After surveying the obstructions to deeper concentration, in the Madhyama-āgama
version the Buddha continues by describing his development of three types of concentration. Although the Majjhima-nikāya version does not take up these three types of
concentration at the present junction of its account, the same threefold development of
concentration comes up again towards the end of both versions. The two versions agree
that these three types of concentration cover:

 - concentration with initial and sustained mental application,

 - concentration without initial but with a remainder of sustained mental application,

 - concentration free from both. [262]

reading instead of ). The Abhidharmakośabhā�ya quote of this statement actually denies the possibility that something non-existent can be seen or known, cf. Abhidh-k 5:27 in Pradhan 1967: 300,12:

The first of these three types of concentration corresponds to concentration up to the
level of the first jhāna, while the last of these three corresponds to the second, third,
and fourth jhānas. Concentration without initial but with still a remainder of sustained
mental application represents a level of concentration situated between the first and the
second jhāna, a level not explicitly taken into account in the usual fourfold reckoning
of the jhānas found in the discourses. [263]
In relation to these three types of concentration, according to the Madhyama-āgama
account the Buddha realized that, while dwelling in one of them and inclining the mind
to another of these three types of concentration, the knowledge and vision (of light and
forms) would certainly not get lost. [264] On realizing this, he developed each of these con

in [[MN128]] and [[MA72]] differ, as according to him in [[MA72]] “the second samādhi is described as one in
which vitakka is absent and vicāra is reduced. In the Pāli version, vicāra is simply stated to be present”.
This does not appear to be the case, as the used in [[MA72]] to qualify seems to render an equivalent to the qualification matta appended to vicāra in the Pāli version, the translator apparently taking
matta in the sense of qualifying vicāra to be reduced in strength, so that the two versions rather seem to
agree in their description; cf. also Bucknell 2010: 49-50. In fact, the expressions saddhāmattakena and
pemamattakena in [[MN65]] at MN I 444,28 have their counterpart in [[MA194]] at T I 749a3 in and
, which confirms that in the Madhyama-āgama corresponds to matta or mattaka (cf. also
Hirakawa 1997: 398, who under lists mātra and mātraka).
263 Although this type of presentation comes to the fore mainly with the Abhidharma and the commentaries, references to a stage of concentration where vitakka has been overcome but vicāra still persists can
be found already in several discourses, cf. [[DN33]] at DN III 219,18, [[SN43.3]] at SN IV 360,11, and [[AN8.63]] at AN IV 300,5. [[SN43.3]] and [[AN8.63]] do not appear to have a Chinese parallel. In the case of DN 少 觀
33, the fragments of the Sa�gīti-sūtra have preserved a reference to these three samādhis, K 484Vc in
Stache-Rosen 1968: 23, cf. also the Sa�gītiparyāya, T 1536 at T XXVI 389b4:
. The same three samādhis recur in Abhidh-k 8:23
under the heading of an exposition given in a discourse, cf. Pradhan 1967: 448,18: traya� samādhaya� 少信
少愛 uktāh sūtre, savitarka� savicāra� samādhi�, avitarko vicāramātra�, 少 avitarko ’vicāra, T 1558 at T XXIX
149c4: 少, T 1559 at T XXIX 301a24:
. Whether the stage where
vitakka has been overcome but vicāra still persists is taken into account explicitly or only covered implicitly in a description of the development of deeper concentration depends on the perspective taken in
regard to this stage of development. The threefold way of presentation found in [[MN128]] focuses on the
role of vitakka and vicāra in particular, and thus explicitly takes up the intermediate stage where the
former has disappeared and the latter still persists. In contrast, the presentation by way of the four 三定者, 一有尋有伺 jhā三摩地, nas has a stronger emphasis on the affective tone of the progress through the 二無尋唯伺三摩地, 三無尋無伺三摩地 jhāna, a progress that proceeds from the rapture and happiness of seclusion (1 [st] jhāna), via the rapture and happiness of concentration (2 [nd] jhāna) and the happiness devoid of rapture (3 [rd] jhāna) to equanimity (4 [th] jhāna). This more
affectively oriented perspective does not need to take into account the stage where 經說等持總有三種, 一有尋有伺, 二無尋唯伺, 三無尋無伺 vicāra still persists, 於經
中說有三定, as this stage still falls under the category of 一有覺有觀三摩提, 二無覺有觀三摩提, “rapture and happiness related to seclusion 三無覺無觀三摩提 ” and, although
being more refined than the rapture and happiness of seclusion experienced when vitakka is still present, still falls short of being the “rapture and happiness of concentration” experienced with the second
jhāna. Thus, these two modes of reckoning jhāna experience do not entail a substantial difference in regard to actual jhāna experience, but are complementary perspectives on the same process of deepening
concentration.

centrations for a whole day, a whole night, or even a whole day and night. This description is not found in the Majjhima-nikāya version.

MN III 161  The undertaking of practice for a whole day, a whole night, or even a whole day and
night comes up in both versions again as part of an examination that investigates why
at times only light is experienced and at other times only forms are seen. [265] The Upakkilesa-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel explain that in each case attention has
been given to only one of these two aspects of the meditative experience, thereby neglecting to give corresponding attention to the other aspect.
The two versions continue by explaining that to experience limited light and forms is
due to having developed only a limited degree of concentration. [266] They indicate that,
once concentration has become immeasurable, the experienced light and forms will
similarly become immeasurable. That is, the nature of the experienced light and forms
is simply a reflection of the degree to which the mind has become concentrated. This
presentation further supports the impression that the point at stake is the development
of a nimitta in the sense of a mental sign, whose form and brilliancy reflects the depth
of concentration.

MN III 162   The Upakkilesa-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel round off their exposition by
recapitulating the mental obstructions to be overcome, after which they take up the development of concentration by way of initial and sustained mental application, absence
of initial but presence of sustained mental application, and absence of both. The
Majjhima-nikāya version continues by listing concentration with and without rapture,
concentration with enjoyment, and concentration with equanimity. [267] The Madhyamaāgama account instead lists one-sided and variegated concentration, as well as limited
and immeasurable concentration. [268]


. [[MA72]] continues by examining the possibility that the mind may incline towards another of the three types of concentration for all possible cases, that is, not only in the ascending and descending order of these three levels of concentration, but also for the possibility that the mind
may incline from initial and sustained mental application directly to the absence of both, and vice versa.
265 [[MN128]] at MN III 161,4 and [[MA72]] at T I 539a2.
266 [[MN128]] at MN III 161,30 explains that “at the time when concentration is limited, at that time my

[mental] eye is limited”, yasmi� kho samaye paritto samādhi hoti, paritta� me tamhi samaye cakkhu
hoti (B [e] -MN III 200,8 and C [e] -MN III 356,39 add me after kho and read tasmi�, S [e] -MN III 308,18 adds
me after paritto), which then results in experiencing limited light and forms. [[MA72]] at T I 539a18 offers a small but noteworthy additional detail in this respect, as it indicates that “because of entering
如是我必不失此智見 concentration to a limited degree, the purity of the [mental] eye is limited, and because of the limited
purity of the [mental] eye, I experience light and see forms to a limited degree”,
. The reference to “purity” helps to clarify the idea behind the reference to a “limited [mental] eye” in [[MN128]]

The Majjhima-nikāya discourse introduces this survey of concentrations with an announcement by the Buddha that he will develop a threefold concentration. [269] This suggests the three types of concentration mentioned in both versions to be the more original part of the exposition, while the other concentrations listed subsequently in each
version, which are without a counterpart in the parallel version, could be later additions.
The Upakkilesa-sutta concludes with the Buddha’s explanation that, after developing
these types of concentration, he attained awakening. [270] The Madhyama-āgama version
makes explicit what is only implicit in the Majjhima-nikāya version, as it mentions that
after developing these types of concentration the Buddha practised the requisites of
awakening and thereby reached awakening, clarifying that the present passage is not
meant to imply that jhāna alone will suffice for awakening. [271]


[[MN129]] Bālapa��ita-sutta

The Bālapa��ita-sutta, the “discourse on the wise and the fool”, examines what makes
the difference between a fool and a wise person. This discourse has a parallel in the
Madhyama-āgama and another parallel in an individual translation. [272] A smaller part of
the discourse has also been preserved as a discourse quotation in Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya, extant in Tibetan. [273] Moreover, a counterpart

concentration mentioned also in [[MN128]] and [[MA72]] while T 1559 at T XXIX 277b2 explains that the
development of leads to rebirth in the Akani��ha Brahmāloka, .

suggests this expression to stand for the three types of concentration (with and without vitakka), as [[DN33]] at DN III 219,19 lists the same three under the heading tayo samādhi.
270 According to Ps IV 209,26, the development of this threefold concentration took place during the last
watch of the night of the Buddha’s awakening, mahābodhimūle nisinno pacchimayāme. This explanation does not fit [[MN128]] at MN III 161,5 and its parallel [[MA72]] at T I 538c9, according to which the
Buddha repeatedly spoke of developing these different types of concentration for a whole day, a whole 一向定
night, and a whole day and night, kevalam pi ratti� kevalam pi divasa� kevalam pi rattindiva� (B [e]  MN III 199,20: diva� 雜定 instead of divasa�),, indicating that this whole development 若修雜定, 此人必生阿迦尼師吒天
was not confined to a single night.

272 The parallels are [[MA199]] at T I 759a-763a and T 86 at T I 907a-919b. [[MA199]] and T 86 agree with [[MN129]] on the location. [[MA199]] has the title “discourse on the stages of the fool and the wise”,,
while T 86 has the title “discourse spoken by the Buddha on hell”, . According to the information given in the Taishō edition, T 86 was translated by Dharmarak�a. Several parts of [[MA199]] have

to the Bālapa��ita-sutta’s description of suffering in hell can be found in the Divyāvadāna, explicitly identified as belonging to a version of the present discourse. [274]

MN III 163  The Bālapa��ita-sutta and its Chinese parallels begin by defining the fool as one who
performs evil by way of body, speech, and mind. [275] They differ to some degree in their
description of what such evil conduct entails (see table 13.8).
The Bālapa��ita-sutta illustrates performance of evil with the examples of killing,
stealing, sexual misconduct, false speech, and indulgence in intoxicating liquors. [276]


Table 13.8: Evil Conduct in [[MN129]] and its Parallels








|[[MN129]]|[[MA199]]|T 86|
|---|---|---|
|killing (1)<br>stealing (2)<br>sexual misconduct (3)<br>false speech (4)<br>taking liquor (5)|killing (→ 1)<br>stealing (→ 2)<br>sexual misconduct (→ 3)<br>false speech (→ 4)<br>(etc. up to) wrong view<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>(≠ 5)|killing (→ 1)<br>stealing (→ 2)<br>sexual misconduct (→ 3)<br>cheating<br>divisive speech<br>harsh speech<br>false speech (→ 4)<br>envy<br>covetousness<br>no faith in Buddha<br>no faith in discourses<br>no faith in karmic retribution<br>no faith in rebirth<br>(≠ 5)|



The Madhyama-āgama version agrees with the Majjhima-nikāya version on the first
four, from killing to false speech, but then continues with the remaining actions found
in the standard expositions of the ten unwholesome courses of action (although it presents these in an abbreviated manner). [277] The Madhyama-āgama discourse thereby
does not include indulgence in intoxicating liquors in its exposition. The same type of
indulgence is also absent from the individual translation, which in addition to the evil

deeds listed in the Majjhima-nikāya version mentions other unwholesome modes of
speech, envy and covetousness, as well as lack of faith in the Buddha, in the discourses,
in the karmic retribution for evil and meritorious deeds, and in the possibility of being
reborn in hell. [278]
The Bālapa��ita-sutta and its Chinese parallels take up three instances where the
fool experiences retribution for evil conduct during the same lifetime. Two of these
three instances take place when the fool hears others speak about such evil conduct and
when he sees the punishments inflicted on someone who has been caught for performing such evil conduct, [279] situations which make him realize that the same awaits him if
he is found out.
The Bālapa��ita-sutta illustrates the third instance of retribution in the present life
by describing how a fool is overwhelmed by memories of his deeds when taking a rest,
just as towards evening the shadow of a great mountain covers the whole ground in its
vicinity. [280] The Madhyama-āgama version differs in so far as here the fool is not simply taking a rest, but is sick and in pain. [281]
Although the individual translation also takes into account that the fool will not find
peace when lying down to rest, [282] it agrees with the Madhyama-āgama account on
associating the manifestation of such regret to an occasion when the fool is affected by
disease. A discourse in the A�guttara-nikāya similarly relates the regretful reflection described in the Bālapa��ita-sutta to the time of being sick and on the verge of death. [283]
The Bālapa��ita-sutta and its Chinese parallels next turn to the retribution to be expected after death, illustrating the intensity of suffering in hell with the example of a
culprit whose punishment is to have three hundred spears thrown at him. [284] Just as [[AN278]] T 86 at T I 907b2, where this listing comes at a different junction of the discourse, namely in a description of how the evil-doer on rebirth in hell will be reminded of his or her deeds.
279 [[MN129]] at MN III 163,26, [[MA199]] at T I 759b11, and T 86 at T I 907a20. For a more detailed comparison of the various punishments that, according to [[MN129]] and [[MA199]] are inflicted by a king on such
an occasion cf. Minh Chau 1964/1991: 133-134. T 86 at T I 907a17 differs on the first of these two instances, as it instead describes how a fool suffers on hearing the wise predict rebirth in hell for evil conduct, a difference in line with a general tendency of this discourse to emphasize the topic of the hells.
280 This simile also occurs in the Śrāvakabhūmi, Shukla 1973: 80,17 or ŚSG 1998: 124,12 and T 1579 at T
XXX 408c27; cf. also the Yogācārabhūmi, Bhattacharya 1957: 17,6 and T 1579 at T XXX 281c13.
281 [[MA199]] at T I 759b25: “at a time [when he is] sick and experiences suffering”, . [[MA199]] continues by describing that in this way the fool will meet with an unfavourable death, while T 86
depicts how, on being affected by disease, the fool gets visions of the tortures that await him in hell.
282 T 86 at T I 907a26: “[when] the fool lies or gets up, be it in the morning or at night, he is never at peace”,
.
283 The reflection in [[AN4.184]] at AN II 174,19 is worded in the same way as in [[MN129]] at MN III 165,4,
differing from [[MN129]] in as much as it notes that this person, on being “affected by some strong disease”, AN II 174,17: aññatarena gā�hena rogāta�kena phu��assa, is under fear of death, AN II 174,25:
bhāyati santāsam āpajjati mara�assa.
284 [[MN129]] at MN III 165,26, [[MA199]] at T I 759c21, and T 86 at T I 907b11. This simile recurs in [[SN12.63]]
at SN II 100,10 and in its parallel [[SA373]] at T II 102c23 to illustrate the nature of consciousness as one 若時疾病受苦
of the four nutriments.

pebble is insignificant compared to a mountain, so the suffering of this culprit is insignificant compared to the suffering in hell.

MN III 166  The three versions expand on the same topic by describing the various tortures that
await the evildoer in hell, such as having blazing stakes put through each limb, being
dragged across blazing ground, being put on a blazing mountain, or lowered into a
blazing cauldron. [285] The Majjhima-nikāya version and the individual translation culminate their description with a hell completely made of blazing iron. [286] The Madhyamaāgama version instead describes a hell where all sensory experiences are totally unpleasant and undesirable. [287]

MN III 167   The Bālapa��ita-sutta and its parallels next take up the prospect of being born in the
animal realm, distinguishing between animals that feed on grass or on dung, or that
live in darkness, in water, or in filth. The three versions list these in differing sequences
(see table 13.9). [288]


Table 13.9: Types of Animal Rebirth in [[MN129]] and its Parallels








|[[MN129]]|[[MA199]]|T 86|

The Majjhima-nikāya version describes how dung-eating animals will rush forwards
on smelling dung in the hope of getting food, comparable to Brahmins who rush forwards when they smell sacrifices. [289]

285 [[MN129]] at MN III 166,19+32 and MN III 167,2+6, [[MA199]] at T I 760b19 and T I 760c5+16+23, and T
86 at T I 907c21+13+2+16. [[MA199]] and T 86 compare the cauldron punishment to boiling legumes in a
pot. For a more detailed comparison of the hell tortures described in [[MN129]] and [[MA199]] cf. Minh
Chau 1964/1991: 135-137. A description of these tortures can also be found in the Divyāvadāna in Cowell 1886: 375,22 or in Vaidya 1999: 236,20. Braarvig 2009: 269 note 24 comments that “one is struck
by the imaginary power of cruelty and the highly developed ancient science of torture”.
286 [[MN129]] at MN I 167,13 and T 86 at T I 907c26. T 86 at T I 907c29 continues by describing that the fire
in this hell rebounds from each wall, depicting how at times the doors are opened, only to close again
before the culprit can make an escape, details also mentioned in a description of this hell in [[MN130]] at
MN III 183,29.
287 [[MA199]] at T I 761a6 speaks of this hell as the hell of “six contacts”, (on cf. above p. 270
note 31); cf. also a reference to this hell as in [[SA210]] at T II 53a13 and the similar expression chaphassāyatanika, which in [[MN50]] at MN I 337,7 ranks as one of the appellations of the
great hell.
288 In regard to animals born in filth, [[MN129]] at MN III 168,32 speaks of animals born in rotten fish, rotten
corpses, rotten food, a cesspit, or a sewer; [[MA199]] at T I 761a22 describes animals born inside the body,
such as worms; and T 86 at T I 908c13 mentions various worms that live in filth.
289 [[MN129]] at MN III 167,32. Neumann 1896/1995: 1145 note 469 points out that a similarly derogatory
image can be found in Chāndogya Upani�ad 1:12, which compares Brahmin priests that officiate at a

Instead of this somewhat derogatory comparison, the Madhyama-āgama version
illustrates the behaviour of dung feeding animals with the example of boys and girls
who come running when they smell food, and the individual translation describes people in general who rush forwards in expectation of food. [290]
The three versions agree in illustrating the difficulty of reaching a higher rebirth, after having been reborn in a lower sphere, with the example of the time it will take a
blind turtle that comes up to the water surface only once every hundred years to succeed in putting its head through a hole in a yoke or a piece of wood that floats somewhere on the great ocean. [291]
Even if the fool manages to be reborn as a human, [292] he will be reborn in bad circumstances that prompt him to do evil again, whereby he will soon return to a lower
realm. The three versions agree that the misfortune of a lower rebirth is far worse than
the misfortune of a gambler who at the first throw has lost all his family, wealth, and
property. [293]
The Bālapa��ita-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel continue by taking up the
complementary case of a wise person, giving it a treatment that mirrors the treatment
they had given to the fool. The theme of the wise person is not covered in the individual translation. [294]

found in a Chinese Udāna collection, T 212 at T IV 615c11. For a Gāndhārī version cf. Allon 2007.
The same simile recurs in the Sūtrasamuccaya, which gives a Sa�yukta-āgama collection as its source,
cf. T 1635 at T XXXII 50a26 and the Tibetan version in Pāsādika 1989b: 4,19. Norman 1972/1990: 157
draws attention to a Jain version of this simile, which instead of a turtle speaks of a yoke-pin entering
the hole of a yoke that floats somewhere on the ocean. Upadhye 1972: 323 quotes another occurrence
in Māt�ce�a’s Adhyardhaśataka 1.5, cf. Jayaswal 1973: 1; cf. also De 1907: 173-175 and Hara 1986b:
46-47, who provides further references in id. p. 58 note 24.
292 A discourse quotation that parallels the reference to rebirth as a man in [[MN129]] at MN III 169,26 can
be found in Abhidh-k 2:41 in Pradhan 1967: 68,7; cf. also T 1558 at T XXIX 24b7, T 1559 at T XXIX

that the expression kaliggaha, used in this simile in [[MN129]] at MN III 170,8, refers to a particular type
of throw, the kali throw. In his detailed study of dice game in ancient India, ibid. p. 161 explains that
such dice game can involve a considerable number of unmarked dice. At first an accidental number of
these dice are thrown. Then the task of the gamblers is to recognize as quickly as possible the number
of dice that have been thrown in order to be able to throw another number of dice in addition to those already thrown with the aim of arriving at a particular total number. Ibid. pp. 167-168 applies this explanation to [[DN23]] at DN II 348,20, where a gambler cheats by swallowing a dice, an action that would
alter the total number of dice and could thus turn defeat into victory, and to [[DHP|DHP252]] which compares
hiding one’s own mistakes to a swindler who tries to hide a kali throw, a bad throw, from his opponent,
presumably also trying to conceal a dice in order to change their total number.

746   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


The Bālapa��ita-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel compare the happiness to
be experienced by the wise on being reborn in heaven to the happiness experienced by
a wheel-turning king, explaining that if the happiness of a wheel-turning king were to
be compared to a pebble, the happiness of rebirth in heaven would correspond to a great
mountain. The present section has also been preserved in the discourse quotation in
Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya, which differs in so far it
compares dust on the Buddha’s finger tip to the dust of the great earth. [295]
The Majjhima-nikāya version at this point gives a detailed account of the seven treasures and four types of success of a wheel-turning king, not found in the Madhyama-āgama version or in the discourse quotation in Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya. [296] Judging from the absence of such an exposition in the parallel
versions, this detailed treatment could be a case of expansion on the side of the Majjhima-nikāya version. Perhaps the increasing interest in the topic of a wheel-turning king
caused a more in depth exposition, which originally was of a commentarial nature, to
become part of the discourse during the course of transmission. [297]
When describing the happiness of a heavenly rebirth, the Madhyama-āgama account
and the Tibetan discourse quotation indicate that the wise will experience six types of
pleasant contact. [298] In this way, the description of rebirth in heaven stands in direct contrast to the earlier description of hell in the Madhyama-āgama version, according to
which the fool experiences six types of unpleasant contact.

MN III 178   The Majjhima-nikāya and Madhyama-āgama versions agree that the fortune of rebirth in heaven is far superior to the fortune of a gambler who at the first throw wins a
great fortune. While the Majjhima-nikāya version concludes with the delight of the
monks, the Madhyama-āgama version precedes the same with the Buddha enjoining
the monks to train themselves in adopting the course of action of the wise and avoiding
the course of action of a fool. [299]

ment begins in T 86 at T I 909b2 with the standard opening for a discourse, reading “I heard like this, at
one time the Blessed One was staying in Sāvatthī”, . The circumstance that
this introductory phrase is found in the middle of the text shows that T 86 is a collection of different
discourses relevant to the topic of hell realms, collected under the title “discourse(s) spoken by the
Buddha on hell”, . Such an anthology of passages on the suffering in the hell realms might
have been put together for a specific preaching purpose, such as to inculcate moral behaviour.

296 [[MN129]] from MN III 172,14 to MN III 177,5. Fragments of a treatment of the seven treasures of a
wheel-turning king can be found in SHT VI 1387 (p. 110) and in SHT VIII 1857 (p. 50). The Jain
�hā�a�ga 7.558 in Jambūvijaya 1985: 232,9 lists two sets of treasures of a wheel-turning king, of which
one set of seven comprises material treasures, while the other set of seven covers human treasures.
297 In fact the Pāli commentary at Ps IV 214-230 devotes approximately four times as much space to ex- 聞如是, 一時佛在舍衛國
plaining the treasures of the wheel-turning king compared to the space it devotes to commenting on the
remainder of the discourse at Ps IV 210-214, which reflects the considerable interest of the commentators in the topic of the wheel-turning king. On the increasing importance accorded to the motif of the 佛說泥犁經
wheel-turning king in Buddhist texts cf. also Reynolds 1972: 14.

[[MN130]] Devadūta-sutta

The Devadūta-sutta, the “discourse on the divine messengers”, depicts the hellish
suffering that awaits an evildoer after death. This discourse has a Pāli parallel in the
A�guttara-nikāya and six Chinese parallels, one of which is found as part of a Dīrghaāgama discourse, two parallels are discourses in the Madhyama-āgama and in the
Ekottarika-āgama, and the remaining three parallels are individual translations. [300]
The Devadūta-sutta begins by comparing the Buddha’s vision of the good and bad
destiny of beings after death, in accordance with their deeds, to standing between two
houses and seeing people go back and forth, a simile found also in the Madhyama-āgama and Ekottarika-āgama versions, as well as, with some variations, in the individual
translations. [301]


300 The Pāli parallel is [[AN5.32]] at AN I 138-142. The Chinese parallels are [[DA30]].4 at T I 126b-127a (the
section corresponding to [[MN130]] is part of a considerably longer discourse), [[MA64]] at T I 503a-506a,
[[EA32.4]] at T II 674b-676b, T 42 at T I 826c-828b, T 43 at T I 828b-829b, and the later part of T 86 at
T I 909b-910c, a discourse whose first part parallels [[MN129]] According to the information given in the
Taishō edition, T 42 and T 86 were translated by Dharmarak�a, while T 43 was translated by Hùijiăn
( ). [[MA64]] agrees with [[MN130]] on the title “discourse on the divine messengers”,, a title
also given to [[AN5.32]] in the Burmese edition; cf. also the summary verse at T II 681c7, which refers to
[[EA32.4]] as “divine messenger”, . T 42 has the title “discourse spoken by the Buddha on the iron
wall hell”,, T 43 has the title “discourse spoken by the Buddha on King Yama’s five
divine messengers”,, and T 86 has the title “discourse spoken by the Buddha
on hell”, . [[MA64]] [[EA32.4]] T 42, T 43, and T 86 agree with [[MN130]] on locating the discourse at Sāvatthī, [[DA30]].4 and [[AN5.32]] do not give a location. For a partial translation of [[MA64]] cf.
Minh Chau 1964/1991: 139-142, for a study of the designation of hells in T 42 cf. van Put 2003. Skilling 1997a: 282 notes references to the present discourse in the Abhidharmakośavyākhyā as Devadūtīya-sūtra and in the Lokaprajñapti as *Pañcadevadūtavyākara�a-sūtra; Mejor 2010: 680 notes a reference in the 慧簡 Vinayak�udraka of the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya as lha’i mdo. The use of the 天使經 Devadūtasutta for preaching and conversion is reported in the Mahāva�[[SA12]].29 and 14:63 in B [e] -Mhv 70 and
79, according to which its delivery by Mahādeva in Mahisama��ala (on this location cf. Geiger 1912: 天使
84 note 5 and Hirakawa 1993/1998: 88) caused forty-thousand people to attain stream-entry and the 佛說鐵城泥犁經
like number to go forth, while its preaching in Sri Lanka by Mahinda caused a thousand stream-entries. 佛說閻羅王五天使者經
A discourse quotation paralleling the verse description of the great hell in [[MN130]] at MN III 183, 佛說泥犁經 25
can be found in Abhidh-k 3:59 in Pradhan 1967: 163,12; cf. also T 1558 at T XXIX 58b16 and T 1559
at T XXIX 215c10. Extracts from the present study already appeared in Anālayo 2007c. Obeyesekere
2002: 171 notes that the motif of King Yama’s judgement is popular in modern Sri Lankan drama.
301 [[MN130]] at MN III 178,20, [[MA64]] at T I 503c4, and [[EA32.4]] at T II 674b17. This simile recurs in other
Pāli discourses to illustrate the vision of the re-arising of beings in accordance with their karmic deeds
through exercise of the divine eye, cf., e.g., [[DN2]] at DN I 83,4, [[DN10]] at DN I 209,12, [[MN39]] at MN I
279,12, and [[MN77]] at MN II 21,24. Unlike [[MN130]] these instances first take up the case of those who
perform evil deeds and only then turn to those who do good deeds. The departure in [[MN130]] from the
standard pericope is due to the context, as in the present case the point is not the divine eye as such, but
rather a more detailed examination of the retribution to be experienced when reborn in hell. By mentioning the evildoers in second position, [[MN130]] is able to directly continue with its detailed examination of rebirth in hell. While [[EA32.4]] at T II 674b22 agrees in both respects with [[MN130]] [[MA64]] at T I
503c9 does not mention rebirth as a human, a ghost, or an animal; it also mentions first the evildoers
and then those who perform wholesome deeds. [[MA64]] at T I 503b3 also differs from [[MN130]] in that it



MN III 178


748   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


The Devadūta-sutta and its Ekottarika-āgama parallel examine four alternative modes
of rebirth – heaven, human realm, animal realm, and ghosts – before turning to the possibility of rebirth in hell. The examination of the fruit of good and evil deeds in the Madhyama-āgama version and the individual translations, however, focuses only on the contrast between rebirth in heaven and in hell.
The Dīrgha-āgama and the A�guttara-nikāya discourses do not begin by describing
the Buddha’s vision of the destiny of beings at all, but instead directly approach the
topic of rebirth in hell. [302]

MN III 179  According to the Devadūta-sutta, on arrival in hell the culprit will be questioned by
King Yama if he never saw the divine messengers, which are:

       - a baby lying in its excrement,

       - an old person,

       - a sick person,

       - a criminal caught and punished for his deeds,

       - a dead person.
These are five ‘divine messengers’ in the sense that they exemplify the inevitability
of birth, old age, disease, karmic retribution, and death. This interrogation by King Yama is found in all parallels to the Devadūta-sutta, and additionally also in several other
texts preserved in Chinese. [303]
The sequence of listing the five divine messengers differs between the Devadūta-sutta and its Chinese parallels. While in the Pāli account the criminal caught and punished


employs a whole series of other similes, in addition to the simile of standing between two houses. Thus,
[[MA64]] compares the destiny of beings after death to the arising and passing away of bubbles on a water surface during rain and to raindrops falling on upper and lower places during a great rain, followed
by illustrating the vision of their sa�sāric journey to seeing a gem strung on a string (on this simile
from a comparative perspective cf. Meisig 1987b: 68-72, for an interpretation of the image used in this
simile cf. Hamilton 1996: 87) or to standing on top of a building and watching people below act in various ways. In a similar vein, T 42 at T I 827a5 and T 86 at T I 909b7 describe bubbles arising and passing away during rain, someone who stands at a city gate at night in the light of a fire and sees people
come in and go out (this seems to be their counterpart to the simile found in [[MN130]]), someone who
stands on top of a tall building and sees all other households around, someone who is in a boat and sees
the fishes and stones below in the water, and someone who looks at a gem strung on a string. T 43 at T
I 828b24 has the simile of the bubbles during rain and the gem strung on a string, after which it describes seeing people at night come in and out through an entrance (being its counterpart to the simile
in [[MN130]]), and seeing people from on top of a building.
302 [[DA30]].4 at T I 126b19 and [[AN5.32]] at AN I 138,7.
303 The interrogation by King Yama can also be found in T 24 at T I 331a5, T 25 at T I 386a1, T 212 at T
IV 668c3, and T 741 at T XVII 547a10 (which the Madhyama-āgama edition p. 441 note 4 lists as
one of the parallels to [[MA64]] and therewith to [[MN130]]). A presentation of the same themes as modes
of reflections about old age, death, etc., without being related to Yama or the devadūtas, can be found
in [[AN5.57]] at AN III 71-75. It also needs to be noted that the role of King Yama is not that of a judge,
which, as pointed out by Siklós 1996: 176, would conflict with the theory of karma. Marasinghe 2002b:
631 explains that “Yama, the Ṛg Vedic god of death and the king and ruler of the underworld ... has been
reduced in Buddhism to a mere passive onlooker at the uninfluenced operation of the law of kamma”.

comes before the messenger of death, in those parallel versions that also have five divine messengers the criminal is the last in the list (see table 13.10). [304]

Table 13.10: Listings of Divine Messengers in [[MN130]] and its Parallels

Unlike the Devadūta-sutta and its other parallels, the Dīrgha-āgama and A�guttaranikāya versions only list three divine messengers, namely old age, disease, and death. [305]
According to the traditional account, these are the three aspects of human life that had
been instrumental in stirring the bodhisattva to go forth and eventually become a Buddha, [306] although they are not designated as “divine messengers” in this context. [307]
The first out of the set of five divine messengers is a small infant that is lying in its
own excrement. [308] The Madhyama-āgama version explains that the infant is not able to

304 [[MA64]] at T I 504b25, [[EA32.4]] at T II 675a15, T 42 at T I 827b20, T 43 at T I 829a20, T 86 at T I 909c26,
T 212 at T IV 669a24, and T 741 at T XVII 547b5 ([[AN5.32]] [[DA30]].4 T 24, and T 25 list only three divine messengers, none of which corresponds to the criminal; cf. also Masson 1942: 87, who notes that
the criminal is the only divine messenger that does not represent a stage in life). Since the punishment
for evil deeds described in the present discourse takes place after death, when the evildoer has to face
hell, this sequence fits the context well. Another difference in sequence is that T 42 at T I 827b3+8, T
86 at T I 909c7+13, and T 212 at T IV 668c17+28 have disease as their second and old age as their third,
while the other versions agree on listing old age as their second and disease as their third.
305 [[DA30]].4 at T I 126b20 and [[AN5.32]] at AN I 138,7. T 24 at T I 330c25 and T 25 at T I 385c22 also mention only three divine messengers.
306 The effect of these three divine messengers on the bodhisattva is described in [[AN5.34]] at AN I 145,21,
according to which on seeing others grow old, become sick, and pass away, all pride in his youth, health,
and [future] life span disappeared (cf. also [[MN83]] at MN II 75,17 for the effect the divine messenger of
old age had on the bodhisattva in a previous life), themes that recur in the description of his motivation
to go forth in [[MN26]] at MN I 163,15. [[AN5.34]] could be the nucleus out of which the traditional account
developed, according to which the bodhisattva was totally unaware of these predicaments of human existence until during pleasure outings he saw for the first time in his life an old person, a sick person, and
a dead person, cf., e.g., the Jātaka Nidānakathā in Jā I 58,31, the Mahāvastu in Basak 1965: 212,5 or in
Senart 1890: 150,18, the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya, T 1421 at T XXII 101b22, the Sa�ghabhedavastu in Gnoli
1977: 65,7, and a Chinese Udāna collection, T 212 at T IV 619b14; cf. also above p. 172.
307 Kariyawasam 1988: 421 points out that the “portents that prompt a bodhisatta to renounce the world are
called pubbanimittā (signs, which herald) and not devadūtas”; cf. also Borges 1974: 740, who notes
that the present discourse does not provide any explicit relation between the devadūtas and the Buddha’s own life.
308 Instead of describing an infant that is lying in its excrements, according to T 42 at T I 827a28 and T 86
at T I 909c1 Yama first of all asked the culprit why he did not respect his father and mother, even though


750   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


call his parents and ask them to wash him, a point made also in one of the individual
translations and in the Pāli commentary. [309] In addition to referring to the infant’s need
to be fed and washed by others, the Ekottarika-āgama also mentions the suffering experienced while still being in the womb. [310]

MN III 180   In relation to the divine messenger that manifests in the sight of an old person, while the
other versions only describe various physical manifestations of old age, the Ekottarikaāgama version additionally points out that the mind of elderly people will no longer be
as strong and vigorous as it had been in their youth. [311]

MN III 181  When turning to a sick person in its function as a divine messenger, the Devadūtasutta depicts how such a person is being lifted up and put down by others. [312] The Ekottarika-āgama discourse describes how a sick person may lie in his own excrement and
be unable to get out of it on his own, [313] in the Dīrgha-āgama account the sick person is
in tears and moaning due to pain, [314] and according to one of the individual translations
this sick person’s disease is incurable. [315]
In relation to the divine messengers of death, manifesting in the vision of a corpse, the
Dīrgha-āgama and Madhyama-āgama versions describe how such a corpse becomes


they had brought him up and nourished him. As the point of the other divine messengers in all versions
is that on seeing others subject to old age, disease, etc., the culprit should have realized that he will himself be subject to the same predicament, it would be more natural if the same point were to be made in
regard to birth as well. The Pāli and Chinese versions agree on mentioning lack of respect for mother
and father, or even ill-treating them, among the evil deeds of the culprit. Perhaps this reference to lack
of respect has led to a misunderstanding or mistranslation of the first divine messenger in T 42 and T
86, two discourses that according to the indication given in the Taishō edition were translated by the
same translator. Van Put 2003: 227 remarks, regarding T 42, “quite interesting is the emphasis put on
piousness towards one’s parents, a virtue which is usually seen as a typical Confucian addition”.
309 According to [[MA64]] at T I 504a3, the child is lying in its own excrement and “is not able to call [its]
mother and father, [asking] the mother and father to take it up out of the dirt and wash its body”,
. T 43 at T I 828c14 explains that the child is lying in its own
excrement and “is not able to look after itself and does not [yet] know how to speak words with its
mouth”,, thus apparently making the same point as [[MA64]] Ps IV 231,26 depicts the predicament of the child in the following terms: “I have fallen into my own urine and faeces, I
am not able to properly get up and wash myself ... I am not able to say ‘wash me!’”, sake pana ’mhi
muttakarīse palipanno, attano dhammatāya u��hahitvā nahāyitu� na sakkomi ... nahāpetha man ti vattum pi na sakkomi.
310 [[EA32.4]] at T II 674c7. T 741 at T XVII 547a22 also draws attention to the suffering experienced by the
mother during pregnancy and when giving birth.

313 [[EA32.4]] at T II 674c 不能自護, 口不知言語 29: . During Yama’s investigation in [[EA32.4]] at T II 675a3, the culprit
denies having seen such a sick person,, which judging from the context and the pattern
adopted in the exposition in general is probably a textual error for, in fact, just a few lines
earlier the culprit admits having seen such a sick person, [[EA32.4]] at T II 674c29: .
314 [[DA30]].4 at T I 126c10.

food for animals, or else will be cremated, [316] while the Ekottarika-āgama version draws
attention to the sorrow of the relatives. [317]
The Chinese discourses agree with the Pāli versions in describing how King Yama
made it clear after each inquiry that the culprit had performed the evil deed, not anyone
else, wherefore the culprit will also have to experience the retribution for these deeds. [318]
The Devadūta-sutta continues by describing the suffering to be experienced in hell,
where the guardians of hell inflict the following punishments:

 - driving hot iron stakes through the limbs of the culprit,

 - cutting him to pieces,

 - harnessing him to a chariot and dragging him across blazing ground,

 - making him climb up and down a blazing mountain,

 - hanging him into a blazing cauldron,

 - finally throwing him into the great hell. [319]
In this great hell made of iron walls a terrible fire rages. Once in a long time one of
the four doors of this hell opens, but then closes again before the culprit has been able
to escape. When after a long time the culprit does manage to get out before the door
closes again, he finds himself confronted with other types of suffering.
According to the Devadūta-sutta, the sufferings to be expected after escape from the
great hell are:

 - falling into a hell of excrement where little creatures bore into the culprit’s body,

 - falling into a hell of hot embers,

 - having to climb up and down trees with long blazing thorns,

 - having to go into a forest with sword leaves that cut the culprit to pieces,

 - falling into a river with caustic water. [320]
The Madhyama-āgama and the Ekottarika-āgama versions list a similar set of hellish
sufferings. [321]


316 [[DA30]].4 at T I 126c21 and [[MA64]] at T I 504b13. T 43 at T I 829a13 and T 212 at T IV 669a13 also describe that the corpse will be eaten by birds and dogs, while T 42 at T I 827b15 and T 86 at T I 909c20
depict how it will be eaten by worms and ants.

at T I 909c10, and T 212 at T IV 668c13.
319 [[MN130]] at MN III 182,34, a description found also in [[AN5.32]] at AN I 141,1. This set of tortures recurs
in [[MN129]] at MN III 166,19 and in its parallels [[MA199]] at T I 760b19 and T 86 at T I 907c2, cf. above
p. 744 note 285. [[DA30]].4 at T I 127a2, [[MA64]] at T I 504c13, and T 42 at T I 827b27 turn directly to the
great hell, without describing these preliminary tortures. T 43 at T I 829b1 ends after the five messengers and thus does not depict the hells in which the culprit will have to suffer at all. [[EA32.4]] at T II
675b16+26 and T II 675c9 describes how the culprit is pared with axes, harnessed to a chariot, made to
climb up and down a blazing mountain, has hot iron stakes driven through his limbs, and is hung into a
cauldron. A description of various hells that culminates by depicting the suffering in the great hell can
also be found in the Mahāvastu in Basak 1963a: 11-19 or in Senart 1882a: 9-15.

The Devadūta-sutta continues by describing that, when the culprit mentions that he is
hungry or thirsty, the wardens of hell put a blazing metal ball into the culprit’s mouth
or pour molten metal down his throat, after which he is thrown back into hell, a treatment also recorded in the Madhyama-āgama and Ekottarika-āgama versions. [322] These
graphic descriptions of various tortures reflect ancient Indian conceptions of the hell
realms. [323]

MN III 186  The Devadūta-sutta reports an aspiration by King Yama in which he expresses his
wish to be reborn as a human and to be able to receive and understand the teachings of
a Buddha, an aspiration also recorded in the A�guttara-nikāya discourse. [324] Yama’s aspiration in the Madhyama-āgama version is more detailed, as he wishes to be reborn in
a wealthy and good family, from which he then hopes to go forth and reach full awakening under a Buddha. [325]
According to the Dīrgha-āgama and Ekottarika-āgama presentations, however, Yama was not concerned with future wealth or a good family. Instead, he simply wished
to be reborn as a human in order to go forth and undertake the path to awakening. [326]

505a24 the sword leaf forest, and [[MA64]] at T I 505b23 the caustic river. [[EA32.4]] at T II 676a18 takes
up the excrement hell, while [[EA32.4]] at T II 675b19 and again at T II 676a9+15 refers to a sword thorn
forest. A sword mountain, a thorn forest, and a caustic river can be found in T 42 at T I 827c17+24 and
at T I 828a4, as well as in T 86 at T I 910a28 and T I 910b8+18 (in its earlier part, which parallels [[MN129]] T 86 at T I 908a16 and T I 908b3 also describes a hell of hot embers and a sword forest).
322 [[MN130]] at MN III 186,3+13, [[MA64]] at T I 505c5+14, [[EA32.4]] at T II 676a24 and T II 676b5. T 42 at T
I 828a11 and T 86 at T I 907b25 have this as a single treatment of pouring molten metal into the culprit’s throat, after which he is thrown back into hell. A similar treatment is described in [[DA30]].4 at T I
126b16 and in the Divyāvadāna in Cowell 1886: 375,8 or in Vaidya 1999: 236,12 (in the Divyāvadāna
this description is part of a parallel to [[MN129]]). [[MA64]] at T I 505c26 concludes its description of the
different hell realms by explaining that, once the retribution for the evil deeds has been exhausted, the
culprit might be reborn in the animal realm, or the realm of ghosts, or in a heavenly realm. In this way,
[[MA64]] at this point takes up the realms of rebirth covered already in the introductory sections of [[MN130]] and [[EA32.4]] The possibility of being directly reborn in heaven after a life spent in hell is also envisaged in [[AN1.140]] at AN I 37,26. According to the Jain �hā�a�ga 2.68 in Jambūvijaya 1985: 20,1,
however, beings passing away from hell could be reborn as animals or humans, not as denizens of heaven.
323 Law 1925/1998: 115 and 124 comments on the Buddhist descriptions of hells that “a comparison with
the Brahminical idea of hell will show that the conception of the infernal regions is very much the same
in the two systems. The names are often the same and the tortures described in the literature of the respective faiths have much in common”. Similarly, “sufferings in hell described in the Buddhist and Jain
books are almost identical”. Teiser 2004a: 316 sums up that “Buddhist ideas of hell grew out of Vedic
conceptions and share much with Brahmanical (and later Hindu) views of the underworld”. Schmithausen 2000d: 266-268 notes that some of the hellish tortures appear to mirror acts of cruelty or harming inflicted by human beings on animals and thus could be reflecting the ancient Indian conception of
the victim taking revenge in the after life.

The two Pāli versions continue with a remark by the Buddha that he had witnessed
all this himself, a remark not found in any of the parallel versions. [327] This remark makes it
clear that, from the perspective of the Pāli discourses, the above depiction of the various tortures in hell should be taken literally. The Pāli commentary explicitly refutes the
opinion that the guardians of hell do not really exist. [328]
The two Pāli versions conclude with a set of stanzas spoken by the Buddha, in which
he contrasts those who disregard the divine messengers and are reborn in the lower
worlds with those who heed the divine messengers, practise the path, and go beyond all
fear and distress by attaining liberation. [329] The Madhyama-āgama discourse concludes
with a similar set of stanzas, although according to its presentation it was King Yama
who spoke these stanzas. [330] The Dīrgha-āgama account agrees with the Pāli versions
on attributing this set of stanzas to the Buddha. [331] The Ekottarika-āgama version does
not have these stanzas and instead concludes with the Buddha exhorting the monks that
they should be mindful of their bodily, verbal, and mental actions, should overcome the
five fetters, and should develop the five faculties. [332]

at T IV 669b11 has only a single stanza on the impossibility of escaping karmic retribution, corresponding to [[DHP|DHP127]] T 42 at T I 828a25 and T 86 at 910c13 take up the same topic as [[MN130]] as they contrast people who even for a minor evil may fall into hell with those who pursue the path and become

## Chapter 14 Vibha�ga-vagga

[[MN131]] Bhaddekaratta-sutta

The Bhaddekaratta-sutta, the discourses on “an auspicious night”, is the first of four
consecutive Pāli discourses on the same set of stanzas, [1] whose theme is an ‘auspicious
night’. [2] The first of these four discourses, the Bhaddekaratta-sutta, does not have a parallel in the Chinese Āgamas, although a few parts of what appears to be a parallel to the
Bhaddekaratta-sutta have been preserved in a Sanskrit fragment. [3]


[[MN132]] Ānandabhaddekaratta-sutta

The Ānandabhaddekaratta-sutta, the “discourse by Ānanda on an auspicious night”,
reports an explanation by Ānanda of the stanzas on an auspicious night, which is then
repeated by the Buddha. This explanation is the same as the exposition given in the
Bhaddekaratta-sutta. The Ānandabhaddekaratta-sutta has a parallel in the Madhyamaāgama. [4]


1 Skilling 2009a: 406 comments that “the Majjhimanikāya preserves four commentaries on a single verse
passage, showing that from the beginning multiple interpretations, whether by the Buddha himself or by
his auditors, were the normal course of affairs”; cf. also von Hinüber 2007: 107.
2 Concerning the term bhaddekaratta, Bodhi in Ñā�amoli 1995/2005: 1342 note 1210 explains that “ratta
and ratti could be taken to represent respectively either Skt rātra and rātri (= night) or Skt rakta and rakti (= attachment) ... the Central Asian Skt version, the Skt title at the head of the Tibetan version and the
Tibetan translation itself all use bhadrakarātri. This confirms the identification of ratta with ‘night’; [in
regard to the other part of the compound] the change from -e- to -a- can be understood as an attempt to
convert a difficult reading into a more familiar one”. SHT III 816V3 reads bhadragarātrīya (cf. also R2),
while fragment 3b3 in Minayeff 1983: 243 reads bhadrakarātriya�, and fragment 4b1 refers to the whole
discourse as bhadrakarātrīyasya sūtrasya. Out of the Chinese and Tibetan parallels to [[MN132]] [[MN133]]
and [[MN134]] [[MA165]] at T I 696c7 transcribes the expression as, bat di _[h]_ la tεj _[h]_ (following
Pulleyblank 1991: 27, 76, and 203). T 1362 at T XXI 881c10 speaks of the “wholesome night”, .
The Tibetan versions D (313) mdo sde, [[SA161]]b2 or Q (979) shu 171a7, D (617) rgyud ’bum, ba 56a7 or
Q (599) ya 96b3, and D (974) gzungs ’dus, wa� 90a3 refer to the “auspicious night”, mtshan mo bzang
po. This is preceded by ’phags pa, which corresponds to Sanskrit ārya and qualifies the discourse itself,
hence this is not part of a rendering of the term under discussion, cf. Skilling 1997a: 585-586. T 77 at T I
886b7 speaks of the “noble wholesome verses”,, which could perhaps originally have been “noble verses on a wholesome night”, from which a reference to the “night” was lost.
3 The fragment is SHT III 816 (pp. 32-33). SHT III 816V1-2 records that the Buddha was at Jeta’s Grove
and addressed the monks on his own, so that the Sanskrit version appears to be a parallel to [[MN131]] SHT
III 816V4-5 has preserved parts of the verses, while the rest of the fragment continues with 跋地羅帝 dhāra�īs, so
that the remainder of this discourse must have been quite different from [[MN131]] Jā 509 at Jā IV 482, 善夜 1
refers to the Bhaddekaratta-sutta in the context of an account of a past life of the Buddha as the son of
the king of Vārā�asī.
4 The parallel is [[MA167]] at T I 699c-700b, which has the title “discourse spoken by Ānanda”,,
and agrees with [[MN132]] in locating the discourse in Jeta’s Grove by Sāvatthī. Sanskrit fragments in Mi賢善偈

MN III 189  The Ānandabhaddekaratta-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama counterpart begin by relating that Ānanda had taught other monks the stanzas on an auspicious night, together
with an explanation. The Madhyama-āgama version adds that he had given this instruction at the beginning of the night, which would indeed provide a suitable occasion for
delivering such a teaching. [5]

MN III 190  According to the Majjhima-nikāya version, the Buddha came to join the monks and
asked them who had just given an exposition on the bhaddekaratta stanzas. [6] On being
informed that Ānanda had been the speaker, the Buddha told Ānanda that he should repeat his exposition.
The Madhyama-āgama account instead reports that, once the night was over, a monk
went to visit the Buddha and told him about the teachings given by Ānanda. The Buddha then called Ānanda to his presence and asked him to repeat what he had taught.
The subject of Ānanda’s exposition in both versions are the stanzas on an auspicious
night, which begin by enjoining the letting go of past and future, as the past is gone and
the future has not yet come. [7] Besides the Ānandabhaddekaratta-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel, these stanzas can be found in Sanskrit fragments as well as in the
Chinese and Tibetan parallels to the Mahākaccānabhaddekaratta-sutta and the Loma

nayeff 1983: 242-243 have also preserved a discourse on the verses on an auspicious night, with Ānanda
as the main protagonist. Judging from what has been preserved of the introductory narration, this discourse begins with a tale found also in the Divyāvadāna in Cowell 1886: 611,2 and in the Śūra�gamasūtra, T 945 at T XIX 106c9. According to this tale, Ānanda had been overpowered by a magic spell cast
by a woman whose daughter had fallen in love with him. He was rescued by a magical counterspell by
the Buddha just in time to prevent him from having sexual intercourse with the girl. Winternitz 1912:
249 comments that “the whole great literature of mantras and dhāra�īs, of spells and incantations, found
in later Mahāyāna, finds its explanation in this episode. The common people felt a need for mantras and
spells, and Buddhism had to take this need into account. In order to be able to confront the mantras of
other sorcerers, the Buddhist monks needed their own mantras. At first these ‘mantras’ were moral sayings like the Ma�gala-sutta and the Ratana-sutta ... but eventually that did not suffice” (“die ganze große
Literatur der Mantras und Dhāra�īs, der Zaubersprüche und Beschwörungsformeln, im späteren Mahāyāna, findet in dieser kleinen Episode ihre Erklärung. Es war das Bedürfnis nach Mantras, nach Zaubersprüchen, im Volke vorhanden und diesem Bedürfnis mußte auch der Buddhismus Rechnung tragen. Um
den Mantras der Zauberer entgegenzutreten, mußten auch die buddhistischen Mönche ihre ‘Mantras’ haben.
Zuerst waren diese ‘Mantras’ noch moralische Sprüche wie Ma�galasutta und Ratanasutta ... das genügte
aber auf die Dauer nicht”). Similar to the Sanskrit fragment in Minayeff 1983: 242-243, SHT III 816, as
well as the individual Chinese parallel and the three Tibetan parallels to [[MN133]] continue after the verses
on an auspicious night with dhāra�īs.

saka�giyabhaddekaratta-sutta. In relation to the first of these stanzas, the Chinese,
Sanskrit, and Tibetan versions agree closely with the Pāli presentation. [8]
The next stanza in the Ānandabhaddekaratta-sutta recommends seeing with insight
whatever arises in the present moment. [9] Instead of the Pāli version’s injunction to remain “unshakeably” (asa�kuppa) established in this practice, the Sanskrit fragments
recommend avoiding “deliberations” (vikalpa). [10] Some of the Chinese translations could
be based on a similar reading, as they speak of thoughts that are unstable. [11]
The third stanza recommends that one should begin practising diligently at once,
since the time of death is unpredictable. [12] The Sanskrit and Tibetan versions of this

8 Sanskrit fragment 3a2-3 in Minayeff 1983: 243 has preserved part of this verse: atita� nānvāgamayed ...
yad atita� niruddha� tad asa�prāptam anāgatam. In T 77 at T I 886b14 (parallel to [[MN134]]) this verse
runs: “do not recall the past, do not have thoughts that seek the future, the past has already ceased, the
future is not obtainable”, . T 1362 at T XXI 882a3

the Pāli version’s pahīna employs an expression that is more usual in contexts where an active abandoning or giving up is implied, 過去當不憶, an implication 當來無求念, that would 過去已盡滅, fit the first 當來無所得 part of the verse better than the present section.

stanza are similar to the Pāli version. [13] Even though the Chinese versions of this stanza
differ to some extent, the main import of this injunction remains the same. [14]
The last of these four stanzas concludes that practice undertaken continuously in this
manner deserves to be reckoned a way of spending an “auspicious night”, [15] a conclusion found in similar terms in the Chinese, Sanskrit and Tibetan versions. [16]
The idea that such diligent practice of meditation in the present moment can be considered a way of spending an “auspicious night” might be intending to set a contrast to
more external or ritualistic ways of spending a night that is considered spiritually auspicious. [17]

The Ānandabhaddekaratta-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel agree that to let
go of past and future requires avoiding desire and attachment towards past or future
manifestations of the five aggregates. [18] A difference in their mode of presentation is
that, while in the Majjhima-nikāya version the whole exposition is a repetition by Ānanda of what he had been teaching the monks earlier, in the Madhyama-āgama version
the same takes the form of a question and answer exchange between the Buddha and
Ānanda, with the Buddha asking after the meaning of each key expression, in reply to
which Ānanda offers his explanations.
In regard to presently arisen phenomena, the Ānandabhaddekaratta-sutta enjoins to
avoid any of the twenty modes of construing a sense of self in regard to the five aggregates, while its Madhyama-āgama counterpart simply speaks of avoiding any desire or
attachment towards the five aggregates. [19]
The Madhyama-āgama version concludes with the Buddha praising Ānanda’s exposition and telling the monks that they should bear it in mind. [20] According to the Majjhima-nikāya version, after expressing his approval in this way, the Buddha repeated
the whole exposition given by Ānanda. [21]


stand for the Brahminical custom of spending a religious observance night by fasting, staying awake,
and meditating, “der Ausdruck bhaddekaratta ... bezieht sich auf eine, auch heute noch begangene und
als ekarātri bekannte brahmanische Feier-Nacht, die fastend, wachend und meditierend verbracht wurde”.
This suggests that the expression bhaddekaratta was perhaps indeed “a popular phrase taken over by the
Buddha and given a special sense by him”, cf. also the discussion in Ñā�amoli 1995/2005: 1343 note
1210, who expressed some uncertainty about this suggestion. Yet, the idea of taking advantage of a religiously auspicious night can be seen, for example, in [[DN2]] at DN I 47,12, where the night of the uposatha, the ancient Indian religious observance day, serves as the suitable occasion for visiting some recluses or Brahmins. Although the central idea of the bhaddekaratta verses might indeed revolve around
such a spiritually auspicious night, the last verse makes it clear that the recommendations given are not
meant for a single night only, as according to all versions such practice should be undertaken “day and
night”, that is to say, continuously. Ñā�ananda 1973/1984: 3 explains that “the Bhaddekaratta-suttas do
not appear to envisage withdrawal from thoughts of the past, future and present for so little as one night.
On the contrary, the verses ... say that the person to be called bhaddekaratta is he who abides ardently
and unweariedly day and night, that is, surely for some consecutive time lasting longer than ‘one night’”.
In fact according to Thanissaro 2002: 346, the reference to a night in the expression bhaddekaratta
“should be interpreted in light of the custom – common in cultures that follow the lunar calendar – of
calling [[AN24-]]hour period of day-and-night a ‘night’”; cf. also Winternitz 1908: 361 note 1, who notes
that in India time is reckoned in “nights”, instead of “days”.
18 While [[MN132]] at MN III 190,30 speaks of delight, nandi, in regard to past or future manifestations of
the five aggregates, [[MA167]] at T I 700a24 mentions “delight”,, “desire”,, “attachment”,, and
being “established”,, in regard to past or future manifestations of the five aggregates.
19 [[MN132]] at MN III 190,32 employs the standard formula for such construction of a sense of self, which
takes up four modes of considering each of the five aggregates as self, making up twenty ways of construing a self in total. [[MA167]] at T I 700b13 instead uses the same set of terms it had earlier employed
in relation to past and future, as it recommends “not delighting”,, “not desiring”,, “not attaching”,, and “not being established”,, in relation to the five aggregates of clinging.

[[MN133]] Mahākaccānabhaddekaratta-sutta

The Mahākaccānabhaddekaratta-sutta, “the discourse by Mahākaccāna on an auspicious night”, records an explanation of the stanzas on an auspicious night by Mahākaccāna. This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama. [22] The first part of the Mahākaccānabhaddekaratta-sutta also has partial parallels in an individual Chinese translation and in a Tibetan discourse found several times in the Tibetan canon. [23]

MN III 192  The Mahākaccānabhaddekaratta-sutta and its Chinese and Tibetan parallels narrate
in similar terms that the monk Samiddhi, [24] who had gone to the hot springs to take a
bath, was asked by a deva if he knew the bhaddekaratta stanzas. [25] Samiddhi had to admit that he did not know the stanzas. On asking the deva the same question, Samiddhi
found out that the deva also did not know the stanzas.
A minor difference in relation to this exchange is that, according to the Pāli account,
the deva first asked Samiddhi if he knew the “summary and the analysis” on an auspicious night, after which the deva asked if Samiddhi knew the “stanzas” on an auspicious night. [26] Since the stanzas correspond to the summary, [27] this double inquiry seems


22 The parallel is [[MA165]] at T I 696b-698c, which has the title, “discourse on a deva at the Hot-spring
Grove”,, and agrees with [[MN133]] on locating the meeting between Samiddhi and the deva
at the hot springs by Rājagaha. A translation of [[MA165]] can be found in Anālayo 2008o; on [[MA165]] cf.
also Minh Chau 1964/1991: 59.
23 The partial Chinese parallel is T 1362 at T XXI 881c-882c, which has the title “discourse spoken by the
Buddha on [the topic of] a good night”,, a discourse that according to the information given
in the Taishō edition was translated by Yìjìng ( ). The Tibetan parallel is found thrice in the Derge
edition and twice in the Peking edition: D (313) mdo sde, [[SA161]]b-163b or Q (979) shu 171a-173b, D
(617) rgyud ’bum, ba 56a-58b or Q (599) ya 96b-98b, and D (974) gzungs ’dus, wa� 90a-92a. The occurrence of three versions of this translation in the Derge edition and two versions in the Peking edition
appears to be due to some degree of uncertainty about the category to which this text should be assigned,
with the 溫泉林天經 result that it was finally placed into two or even into three categories, namely sūtra, tantra, and
dhāra�ī, cf. also Skilling 1997a: 81-83. The Tibetan versions are entitled “auspicious night”, ’phags pa
mtshan mo bzang po zhes bya ba’i mdo, corresponding to Bhadrakarātrī-nāma-ārya-sūtra (the prefix
’phags pa qualifies the discourse itself, cf. Skilling 1997a: 585-586). T 1362 and the Tibetan versions
agree with [[MN133]] on locating the discourse at the hot springs by Rājagaha. 佛說善夜經
24 While [[MA165]] at T I 696b29 agrees with [[MN131]] on the monk’s name, which it renders as 義淨, T
1362 and the Tibetan versions do not record his name.
25 While in [[MN133]] at MN III 192,17 and in [[MA165]] at T I 696c7 the deva inquired after the verses, gāthā/, in T 1362 at T XXI 881c11 and in the Tibetan versions at D (313) mdo sde, [[SA161]]b4 or Q (979)

deva inquired after the whole discourse, /mdo sde. A meeting between Samiddhi and a deva recurs in
the introductory narration to another discourse of different content, [[SN1.20]] at SN I 8,16 (or SN [2] 20 at
SN [2] I 18,10), which similarly records a visit by a deva to Samiddhi who had just taken a bath at the hot
springs (cf. also Jā 167 at Jā II 56,24). This meeting led to a different discussion, as the visiting deva
tried to tempt Samiddhi with sensual pleasures. The parallels to [[SN1.20]] [[SA1078]] at T II 281c4 and
SĀ [2] 17 at T II 379a24, do not report the name of the monk. 三彌提

to some degree to be redundant. Such a redundancy is not found in the Chinese and Tibetan versions, which report only a single inquiry. [28]
According to the Pāli, Chinese, and Tibetan versions, the deva told Samiddhi that he
should learn those stanzas. The Majjhima-nikāya discourse reports the deva’s explanation that these stanzas are beneficial and of fundamental relevance for the holy life, to
which the Madhyama-āgama version adds that they lead to knowledge, realization, and
Nirvā�a. [29]
The Chinese and Tibetan accounts report that Samiddhi asked the deva from whom
he could learn these stanzas. In reply, he was told that he should approach the Buddha.
This exchange is not found in the Pāli version.
Samiddhi then approached the Buddha and related what had taken place. [30] In reply,
the Buddha taught Samiddhi the stanzas on an auspicious night. [31] According to the
Majjhima-nikāya and Madhyama-āgama versions, having taught the stanzas the Buddha retired to his dwelling. [32] The individual Chinese translation and the Tibetan versions continue differently, as in their account the Buddha continues by delivering a series of dhāra�īs. [33] Thus, the remainder of these versions is no longer a parallel to the
Mahākaccānabhaddekaratta-sutta.
From the perspective of the Majjhima-nikāya version, for the Buddha to retire to his
dwelling at this point is rather puzzling, since he did not deliver any explanation of
these stanzas, even though he had earlier agreed to give such an explanation. In the

27 [[MN133]] at MN III 193,24 reports that, after the Buddha had spoken the verses without drawing out their
meaning, the monks were wondering who would be able to explain the meaning of this “summary”, uddesa, thereby identifying the verses as the summary. In fact, apart from the verses it would be difficult
to find anything else that could be reckoned as a summary.

Madhyama-āgama version, however, the deva and Samiddhi had only been discussing
the stanzas, so that when Samiddhi came to see the Buddha he only asked to be taught
the stanzas. [34] In view of this, in the Madhyama-āgama it is quite natural that the Buddha taught only the stanzas. [35]

MN III 194  The Mahākaccānabhaddekaratta-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel describe in
similar terms that the monks approached Mahākaccāna and requested him to explain
the stanzas. In reply to their request, Mahākaccāna explained that to let go of past and
future stands for avoiding delight and attachment in regard to the six senses and in regard to what has been experienced or will be experienced through them.

MN III 196  A minor but telling difference between the two versions is that the Madhyama-āgama
version’s examination of experiences of the past qualifies the sense-organs as “truly
existent”. [36] This appears to be an instance where the school affiliation of the Madhyama-āgama reciters has led to an intrusion of a school-specific tenet, in this case the Sarvāstivāda theory that past and future phenomena truly exist.
What is particularly noteworthy about this case is that the same expression is not used
to qualify sense-organs in future times. [37] Hence, although the use of the qualification
“truly existent” seems to be due to the influence of Sarvāstivāda thought, this influence
appears to have been of a somewhat accidental type, since it is not applied consistently.
If the present passage were the outcome of a conscious editing, the same qualification
would certainly have been applied to the case of future sense-organs.
This finding is significant, as it indicates that, even in the case of evident influence of
the school affiliation of the reciters on the text, such influence need not be the outcome
of deliberate editing, since in such a case all occurrences would have been taken care
of. Instead it seems that part of a Sarvāstivāda commentary on this passage, which presumably would have made some statement to the effect that the sense-organs “truly exist”, became part of the discourse during the process of transmission. Due to the accidental nature of this intrusion of commentarial material into the discourse, only the

34 According to [[MA165]] at T I 697a13, Samiddhi requested that the Buddha teaches the verses on an auspicious night,, while according to [[MN133]] at MN III 193,5 he requested
a teaching on the summary and analysis on an auspicious night, bhaddekarattassa uddesañ ca vibha�gañ ca desetū ti, a request which in both versions is followed by the Buddha telling Samiddhi that he
should pay proper attention to what was about to be said, a standard pericope in the discourses to announce the impending delivery of a teaching and thus an expression of the Buddha’s willingness to
comply with Samiddhi’s request. A minor difference is that the request in [[MA165]] is made in the name
of the monks (that were present on this occasion),, while in [[MN133]] Samiddhi only requested to
be instructed himself. This difference is merely formal, as both versions continue by depicting how the
monks wondered who could give them a detailed explanation, so that from the perspective of both versions other monks were present during this meeting between Samiddhi and the Buddha.
35 For a further discussion of this point cf. below p. 788. 若世尊為諸比丘說跋地羅帝偈者
36 [[MA165]] at T I 697c20 begins its treatment by indicating that “the truly existing eye knows forms”,
, an expression used also for the other sense-organs in relation to past experiences.
37 In its expositions of the future and the present, [[MA165]] at T I 698a15+21 does not employ the expression “truly existent”, but simply speaks of future or present eye, forms and eye-consciousness (etc.),

treatment of the past was affected, and the treatment of present and future experiences
remained in a more original form.
The Mahākaccānabhaddekaratta-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel continue
by reporting that, in relation to the present moment, Mahākaccāna again spoke of avoiding delight and attachment towards the six senses and their objects. The two versions
conclude with the Buddha’s approval of Mahākaccāna’s exposition.


[[MN134]] Lomasaka�giyabhaddekaratta-sutta

The Lomasaka�giyabhaddekaratta-sutta, the “discourse to Lomasaka�giya on an
auspicious night”, records the Buddha’s explanation of the stanzas on an auspicious
night to the monk Lomasaka�giya. This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama and another parallel in an individual translation. [38]
The Lomasaka�giyabhaddekaratta-sutta begins by describing how a deva visited Lomasaka�giya and asked if he knew the summary and analysis on an auspicious night.
When Lomasaka�giya had to admit that he did not know them, the deva further asked
if he knew the stanzas on an auspicious night, which Lomasaka�giya also did not know.
As in the case of the Mahākaccānabhaddekaratta-sutta, this double enquiry seems
somewhat redundant, since the stanzas correspond to the summary. The two Chinese
versions record just a single inquiry, which was if he knew the stanzas and their meaning. [39] Thus, they do not mention any “summary” in addition to the stanzas. According
to all versions, while Lomasaka�giya did not know either the stanzas or their meaning,
the deva knew the stanzas and was able to teach them to Lomasaka�giya.
The Pāli account notes that the deva had heard these stanzas on an earlier occasion,
when the Buddha visited the heaven of the Thirty-three. [40] The two Chinese versions
differ in as much as, according to them, this earlier teaching of the bhaddekaratta stanzas had taken place in the Bamboo Grove by Rājagaha. [41]
Lomasaka�giya reported the matter to the Buddha, [42] who informed him of the name of
the deva. [43] The Lomasaka�giyabhaddekaratta-sutta indicates that the Buddha also ex

38 The parallels are [[MA166]] at T I 698c-699c and T 77 at T I 886a-887a. According to the information
given in the Taishō edition, T 77 was translated by Dharmarak�a. [[MA166]] has the title “discourse on a
venerable one in a meditation-hut among the Sakyas”,, while T 77 has the title “discourse spoken by the Buddha to a venerable elder”, . [[MA166]] and T 77 agree with [[MN134]]
on locating the discourse in Jeta’s Grove by Sāvatthī. On [[MA166]] cf. also Minh Chau 1964/1991: 70.

specification which according to Mochizuki 1940: 35 is in agreement with other sources on the place
where the Buddha spent his seventh rains retreat.

plained that this deva listened closely and gave full attention when hearing the Dharma, [44] a remark not made in the Chinese versions. [45]
According to all versions, the Buddha explained that to let go of the past and the future requires avoiding any desire and attachment in regard to the five aggregates. Similar to the case of the Ānandabhaddekaratta-sutta and its parallel, the Lomasaka�giyabhaddekaratta-sutta explains that in relation to presently arisen phenomena one should
avoid any of the twenty modes of construing a sense of self in regard to the five aggregates, while the Chinese versions simply speak of avoiding desire or attachment towards the five aggregates. [46]
The Apadāna collection reports that, based on this instruction on an auspicious night,
Lomasaka�giya eventually became an arahant. [47]


the deva told him to approach the Buddha, an exchange not reported in [[MN134]] Another parallelism to
the Chinese versions of [[MN133]] is that, according to [[MA166]] at T I 699a8 and T 77 at T I 886c25, the
deva recommended the verses because they were conducive to Nirvā�a. While according to [[MN134]] at
MN III 200,34 Lomasaka�giya left the next morning and went in stages towards Sāvatthī, where the Buddha was staying, in [[MA166]] at T I 699a12 and T 77 at T I 886c3 the meeting between Lomasaka�giya
and the deva took place during the rains retreat, so that he had to wait for the end of the rains retreat period before he could set out to visit the Buddha.
43 [[MN134]] at MN III 201,21 gives the deva’s name as Candana, a name [[MA166]] at T I 699b22 and T 77 at
T I 887a1 render as (identified in Akanuma 1930/1994: 115 to stand for Candana), adding that he
came from the heaven of the Thirty-three (which would be implicit in the Pāli version’s report that the
deva had heard the verses when the Buddha was on visit in the heaven of the Thirty-three). [[MN134]] at
MN III 201,21, [[MA166]] at T I 699b21, and T 77 at T I 887a1 agree on specifying that Candana was a devaputta/ . Lüders 1940a: 86 explains that at times putta or putra is used as a suffix to denote membership in a particular group of beings, social class, or type of occupation, instances where it has lost its
original connotation of being a “son”; cf. also Fick 1897: 179. Thus a devaputta, as Childers 1875/1993:
115 s.v. devaputta explains, “means simply a male deva”.
44 [[MN134]] at MN III 201,22: “having made [it] the object [of his mind], having given attention, having
collected his whole mind, he hears the Dharma attentively”, a��hikatvā manasikatvā sabba� cetaso
samannāharitvā ohitasoto dhamma� su�āti 般那 (B [e] -MN III 242,8: a��hi� and sabbacetasā, C [e] -MN III
428,2: sabbacetaso).
45 This remark does not fit too well with the report in [[MN134]] that on a former occasion this deva had
heard the Buddha teaching the verses and their analysis, [[MN134]] at MN III 200,14: “there the Blessed
One spoke the summary and the analysis on an auspicious night to the 天子 devas of the Thirty-three”, tatra
bhagavā devāna� tāvati�sāna� bhaddekarattassa uddesañ ca vibha�gañ ca abhāsi (S [e] -MN III 369,19
adds kho after tatra). As the deva now remembered only the verses and had already forgotten the explanation, it would seem that the deva did not pay too careful attention when the teaching was originally
delivered, cf. [[MN134]] at MN III 200,4 where the deva has to admit that “I do not remember the summary and the explanation on an auspicious night”, na dhāremi bhaddekarattassa uddesañ ca vibha�gañ
ca. Ps V 7,23 confirms that the deva had learned both verse and analysis, but out of negligence had forgotten the explanation. According to [[MA166]] at T I 698c21 and T 77 at T I 886b13, however, on that
former occasion the Buddha had only taught the verses, without the analysis, so that in the Chinese versions the deva had not forgotten what the Buddha had taught.
46 [[MA166]] at T I 699c19 speaks of “delight”,, “desire”,, “attachment”,, and being “established”,
, while T 77 at T I 887a20 only takes up “delight”,, “attachment”,, and being “established”, .

Chapter 14 Vibha�ga-vagga                                    -  765


Looking back on the four Pāli discourses concerned with the bhaddekaratta stanzas,
a noteworthy circumstance is that the chapter in which they are found, the Vibha�gavagga, has twelve discourses. [48] All other chapters in the Majjhima-nikāya consist of
ten discourses only. [49] Due to the present chapter’s departure from the standard count of
ten discourses, [50] the overall count of Majjhima-nikāya discourses runs into one-hundred-fifty-two, even though the Majjhima-nikāya is divided into three groups labelled
“fifties”, pa��āsa, which gives the impression that there should be only one-hundredfifty discourses. [51]
Perhaps the division heading of “fifty” is best understood as an approximation, as in
the Khandha-sa�yutta and in the Sa�āyatana-sa�yutta most “fifties” contain more
than fifty discourses. [52] Yet, the actual content of the “fifties” in these two sa�yuttas
could be due to later developments. In fact, in the Jātaka collection the division into
fifties is also employed, and here the actual number of discourses contained in each
“fifty” is indeed fifty. [53]
On the assumption that at an earlier stage the final “fifty” of the Majjhima-nikāya
contained just fifty discourses, built on the pattern of ten discourses per chapter, the Vibha�ga-vagga would originally have had only ten discourses, to which subsequently
two discourses were added.
The first discourse in the Vibha�ga-vagga, the Bhaddekaratta-sutta, records exactly
the same exposition as found in the Lomasaka�giyabhaddekaratta-sutta and its Chinese parallels, namely a treatment of the implications of the bhaddekaratta stanzas
from the perspective of the five aggregates, given by the Buddha. It could easily be
imagined that, during the course of transmission, the introductory part of the Lomasaka�giyabhaddekaratta-sutta was lost and only the exposition itself was remembered,
which then became the Bhaddekaratta-sutta. [54] On this hypothesis, perhaps the Bhaddekaratta-sutta was added to the Vibha�ga-vagga after this chapter had already been


48 Extracts from the present discussion already appeared in Anālayo 2010m.
49 Renou 1957: 2 and 29 notes that groups of ten form a principle grouping in Vedic texts, which was also
frequently used by the Buddhists and the Jains.
50 A comparable departure from a standard count of ten can also be found in the case of the pācittiya rules
where, similar to the present case, the penultimate chapter counts twelve, resulting in an overall count of
ninety-two rules in nine chapters, cf. Vin IV 157,8.
51 Norman 1983a: 48.
52 The first and the third “fifty” of the Khandha-sa�yutta contain more than fifty discourses, as is the case
for the first, second, and fourth “fifties” in the Sa�āyatana-sa�yutta (the third “fifty” has fifty discourses
in E [e], but over fifty in other editions). Bodhi 2000: 22 comments that in the Sa�yutta-nikāya the expression fifty “is only an approximation, since the sets usually contain slightly more than fifty suttas”. Somaratne 2006a: 689 notes that in the Sa�yutta-nikāya “the word pa��āsaka is used as a round number”.
53 A division into three fifties in the Ekanipāta of the Jātaka collection (cf. Jā I 261,22, Jā I 410,19, and Jā
I 511,19) groups exactly one-hundred-and-fifty tales into three groups of fifties; cf. also von Hinüber

54 That the Bhaddekaratta-sutta could be the outcome of a transmission mistake within the Pāli tradition is
supported by the circumstance that it is the only one out of the four Pāli discourses that does not have a
Chinese counterpart, although such absence in itself is certainly not conclusive, cf. also above p. 318.

formed in accordance with the ten discourses per chapter pattern, thereby causing an
increase of the number of discourses. [55] The Sanskrit fragments paralleling the Bhaddekaratta-sutta do not necessarily contradict this hypothesis, as after the stanzas on an
auspicious night the Sanskrit version continues with dhāra�īs, so that the Sanskrit discourse seems to stem from a different line of development. [56] On the assumption that the
Bhaddekaratta-sutta could be a later addition to the Vibha�ga-vagga, the count of discourses in this chapter could be reduced to eleven.
Another discourse that could have made its way into the Vibha�ga-vagga at a later
stage is the Dakkhi�āvibha�ga-sutta, a discourse which records how the Buddha refused a gift made to him by his fostermother and then gave an exposition on the merits
of offerings to different recipients. [57] While all the other discourses in the Vibha�ga-vagga follow the same pattern of beginning with a summary statement, followed by offering a detailed exposition of this statement, this pattern is less evident in the Dakkhi�āvibha�ga-sutta. Although this remains hypothetical, perhaps the Dakkhi�āvibha�gasutta did not originally form part of the group of ten discourses that were assembled
under the heading “analyses of a summary”, but was later added to the chapter on
analyses as it has the term “analysis” in its title. [58] The Bhaddekaratta-sutta and the
Dakkhi�āvibha�ga-sutta are respectively the first and the last discourse in the Vibha�ga-vagga, which would be the most probable positions for later additions to the group.
The hypothesis that these two discourses could have been added later to the Vibha�ga-vagga does not imply an assessment of the authenticity of their content, since it
could well be that relatively early material was shifted to a different position within a
discourse collection at a later time. This hypothesis only entails that the arrangement of
the discourses in the Majjhima-nikāya did not come into existence in a single moment,
but rather is the product of a gradual development.
This much would seem to be also implicit in a statement made by the commentaries,
according to which the Bakkula-sutta was only included in the Majjhima-nikāya at the
second council. [59] From this it follows that the chapter in which the Bakkula-sutta is now


55 Horner 1959: 233 note 1 arrives at the opposite hypothesis, suggesting that “this is the Vagga that has 12
Discourses. If it were thought desirable to reduce them to the normal 10, this Discourse [i.e. the
Bhaddekaratta-sutta], spoken by the Lord, would rank as one, and the next three, spoken by disciples,
would have to be counted together as another single Discourse”. Yet, only [[MN132]] and [[MN133]] are
spoken by disciples, whereas the exposition in [[MN134]] is spoken by the Buddha, so that authorship
alone would not suffice for considering [[MN132]] [[MN133]] and [[MN134]] to be three versions of a single
original.

58 According to Rhys Davids 1902: 475, the Dakkhi�āvibha�ga-sutta “seems to belong, in its subject-matter, to the Vinaya” and thus as a Majjhima-nikāya discourse was “probably interpolated”; cf. also Amore
1971: 69, who similarly suggests that this discourse “may have been added after the [Majjhima-nikāya]
collection was organized”.

found could not have been a product of the recitation that, according to the traditional
account, was carried out at the so-called first council.


[[MN135]] Cū�akammavibha�ga-sutta [60]
The Cū�akammavibha�ga-sutta, the “lesser discourse on an analysis of karma”, explains in what way beings are the heirs of their own past deeds. This discourse has six
Chinese parallels, one of which is found in the Madhyama-āgama, while the other five
parallels are individual translations. [61] The Cū�akammavibha�ga-sutta also has two Sanskrit parallels as well as two Tibetan parallels. In what follows, I will refer to the two
Sanskrit versions as the “Karmavibha�ga” and the “Śuka-sūtra”, [62] and to the two Ti

60 Ps V 15,16 records Subha-sutta as an alternative title for [[MN135]]
61 The Chinese parallels are [[MA170]] at T I 703c-706b, T 78 at T I 887b-888b, T 79 at T I 888b-891a, T 80
at T I 891a-895b, T 81 at T I 895b-901b, and T 755 at T XVII 588c-590b. [[MA170]] has the title “discourse to the [Brahmin] Parrot (Suka)”,, T 78 has the title “discourse spoken by the Buddha

[about the Brahmin] Todeyya”,, T 79 has the title “discourse spoken by the Buddha to the

[Brahmin] Parrot (Suka)”,, T 80 has the title “discourse on an analysis of the effects of karma, spoken by the Buddha to the householder Suka”,, T 81 has the title
“discourse on an analysis of good and bad [karmic] retribution”,, and T 755 has the
title “discourse spoken by the Buddha [in reply] to a question put by the lay follower Pure Mind”,
, reconstructed by Lin Li-Kouang 1949: 274 as *Śukla-maty-upāsaka-parip�cchāsūtra. According to the information given in the Taishō edition, T 78 was translated by an unknown
translator, T 79 was translated by Gu�abhadra, T 80 was translated by Qūtán Făzhì (, which
according to Lévi 1932a: 6 corresponds to Gautama Dharmaprajñā or Dharmajñā�a), T 81 was translated
by Tiānxízāi ( ), and T 755 was translated by Dānapāla ( 鸚鵡經 ). The Chinese versions, the Sanskrit and Tibetan Karmavibha�ga 佛說兜調經 s, and the Tibetan Karmavibha�ga-nāma-dharmagrantha agree with
[[MN135]] on locating the discourse 佛說鸚鵡經 at Sāvatthī. Parts of [[MA170]] have been studied and translated by Minh
Chau 1964/1991: 31, 72, 128-130, 184, and 207. A to some extent comparable exposition of the fruits of 佛為首迦長者說業報差別經
karma, based on the ten courses of action, can be found in [[SA1048]] at T II 274a 分別善惡報應經 26.
62 The Sanskrit Karmavibha�ga has been edited in Kudo 2004: 2-227 (cf. also id. 2006a, id. 2006b, and id. 佛說
2007) 淨意優婆塞所問經 and in Lévi 1932a: 21-105; the fragments of the Śuka-sūtra have been published by Hoernle 1916/
1970: 48-52. Other fragments are SHT VI 1210 (pp. 5-6) and probably the so far unpublished fragments
no. 2382/49a, 2382/176, 2382/252, 2382/255, 2382/258a, 2382/uf1/1b, 2382/uf19/1b of 瞿曇法智 the Schøyen collection (2382/49a, 2382/252, 2382/255, 2382/258a, 2382/uf1/1b, and 2382/uf19/1b have been identified
by Klaus Wille, 2382/176 has been noted as a possible parallel by Noriyuki Kudo in his presentation at 天息災 施護
the IABS conference, London 2005; I am indebted to Jens-Uwe Hartmann for kindly providing me with
a preliminary draft transliteration of these fragments). The Schøyen fragments are rather brief, mostly
being on the advantages of giving. Regarding the title of the Sanskrit Karmavibha�ga, I follow Kudo
2004: x, instead of using the title Mahākarmavibha�ga given to the same work by Lévi (although a
recently discovered manuscript of the Karmavibha�ga in Kudo 2006b: 49,3 has preserved the title as
Kukkura-sūtra, “the discourse on the dog”). Hoernle 1916/1970: 48 suggests the Śuka-sūtra to correspond to T 80, as the sequence of the three topics preserved in the Sanskrit fragment recurs in this Chinese version. Yet [[MA170]] T 78, T 79, and T 755 also have the sequence found in the Sanskrit fragment, which proceeds from deeds that result in being influential, via deeds that result in being reborn in
a high family, to deeds that lead to becoming wealthy. Thus, this parallelism on its own would not suffice for concluding that T 80 and the Śuka-sūtra stand in a particularly close relationship to each other.

betan versions as the “Tibetan Karmavibha�ga” and the “Tibetan Karmavibha�ga-nāma-dharmagrantha”. [63] Versions of the present analysis of karma have also been preserved in Khotanese, [64] in Sogdian, [65] and in Tocharian. [66]
With this impressive number of versions preserved in various languages, the Cū�akammavibha�ga-sutta becomes the discourse with more parallels than any other discourse in the Majjhima-nikāya collection. The reason for the considerable interest that
this particular discourse appears to have aroused would probably be the clear-cut relations it establishes between particular deeds done in the past and particular qualities in
a future life. [67]
The basic treatment of this topic is quite similar in the parallel versions, which show
considerable differences, however, in regard to the extent to which this basic treatment
is then elaborated and amplified.

MN III 202 While the Cū�akammavibha�ga-sutta directly begins with the meeting between Subha and the Buddha, [68] several of its parallels provide an introductory narration to this

63 The Tibetan Karmavibha�ga is the las rnam par ’byed pa, translated by Jinamitra, Dānaśīla, Munivarman, and Ye shes sde, cf. Skilling 1997a: 151. The las rnam par ’byed pa, D (338) or Q (1005), has been
edited in Lévi 1932a: 183-214. The Karmavibha�ga-nāma-dharmagrantha is the las kyi rnam par ’gyur
ba zhes bya ba’i chos kyi gzhung, D (339) mdo sde, [[SA298]]b-310a or Q (1006) shu 310b-322a. This discourse has been translated in Feer 1883: 252-279. On a third Tibetan version cf. Simon 1970, who examines the differences between this version and the las rnam par ’byed pa.
64 The fragments of the Khotanese version have been edited and translated by Maggi 1995: 33-82 (being
unable to read Khotanese, my study of this version is based on the translation provided by Maggi).
65 The Sogdian fragment has been edited and translated in Rosenberg 1920 (being unable to read Sogdian,
my comments on this version are based on the translation provided by Rosenberg). Another Sogdian
discourse related to the same topic is the “discourse on causes and effects”, edited and translated by
Gauthiot 1926 and Mackenzie 1970. A Chinese parallel to this discourse can be found in T 2881 at T
LXXXV 1380b-1383b, entitled “discourse spoken by the Buddha on the causes and effects of good and
bad [deeds]”, . This discourse starts with an interrogation by Ānanda somewhat similar
to the question posed by Subha. The Buddha’s reply lists a whole range of different actions and their retribution. The discourse ends with eighty-thousand listeners aspiring for supreme Buddhahood and a
hundred-thousand females spontaneously transforming themselves into males, cf. Gauthiot 1926: 29 or
MacKenzie 1970: 32, and T 2881 at T LXXXV 1383b1.
66 The Tocharian fragments have been edited and translated in Lévi 1933, with corrections by Sieg 1938
(being unable to read Tocharian, my comments on this version are based on the translation provided by
Lévi). The Tocharian fragments parallel parts of the detailed examination of deeds in the Karmavibha�ga not found in [[MN135]] hence for a comparative study of [[MN135]] these fragments are not of direct
relevance.
67 The popularity of this theme can also be seen in sculptures found in Borobudur, Java, which illustrate 佛說善惡因果經
the relationship between deeds and their fruits; for a description of these sculptures cf. Lévi 1937/1996.
Another indication of the importance accorded to karmic retribution would be implicit in the definition
of the faculty (indriya) of faith given in the Arthaviniścaya-sūtra in Samtani 1971: 31,10. Unlike the standard definition given in the early discourses, which speaks of faith in the awakening of the Buddha, according to the Arthaviniścaya-sūtra’s definition such faith is in rebirth and the fact that karma bears fruit.
68 [[MN135]] at MN III 202,13 gives the Brahmin youth’s name as Subha, “beautiful”, a name he received,
according to the commentarial gloss at Ps V 8,9, because of his beauty. The Sanskrit Karmavibha�ga in
Kudo 2004: 4,10 and id. 2006a: 35,7 (cf. also id. 2006b: 49,10) or in Lévi 1932a: 21,15 instead gives his


Chapter 14 Vibha�ga-vagga                                    -  769


meeting, a narration also found in the Pāli commentary. [69] According to this narration,
Subha’s father had been reborn in his own household as a dog. When the Buddha
passed by Subha’s house during his alms round, the dog barked at him. [70] The Buddha
thereon admonished the dog.
When Subha came to know about this, he approached the Buddha and asked about
the reasons for this admonishment. In reply, the Buddha informed Subha that the dog
had formerly been his father. Subha found it difficult to believe that his father had been
reborn in what, from an ancient Indian viewpoint, was a rather low condition. On following the Buddha’s instruction, however, Subha got the dog to reveal some treasures
that his father had buried, which convinced him that the dog was indeed his former
father. This discovery stirred Subha’s interest in the working mechanism of karma so
that he approached the Buddha again and inquired about the reason why people differ in
regard to such things as life span, health, beauty, wealth, social position, and intelligence.
According to the Cū�akammavibha�ga-sutta and most of its parallels, the Buddha ex- MN III 203
plained that karma is responsible for the differences among beings. [71] Subha did not

name as Śuka, “parrot”. [[MA170]] at T I 703c25 similarly renders his name as “parrot”,, as does T
79 at T I 888b20: . Transcriptions that express the same are used in T 80 at T I 891a21: and T
81 at T I 895c3: . T 755 at T XVII 588c15, however, translates his name as “pure mind”,,
which thus agrees with [[MN135]] on the name subha or śubha instead of suka or śuka, at the same time
perhaps mistaking mā�ava for manas. The rendering used in T 80,, recurs in [[DA22]] at T I 95a25.
[[DA23]] at T I 97c28 uses yet another way of rendering Śuka, namely ; on which cf. also Meisig
2010: 67. According to Lévi 1932a: 21 note 3, śuka could stem from an original sua, that developed via
suva (which together with suka renders “parrot” in Pāli, cf. Geiger 1916: 55 and Lüders 1954: 80) to suba and thence to subha. T 78 at T I 887b8 has as the name of its protagonist, which does not seem to
fit either Subha or Śuka.
69 This narration can be found in [[MA170]] at T I 703c24, T 78 at T I 887b7, T 79 at T I 888b 鸚鵡 19, T 81 at T I
895c2, the Sanskrit 鸚鵡 Karmavibha�ga in Kudo 2004: 2,13 and id. 2006a: 35,5 (cf. also id. 2006b: 49, 首迦 8) or
in Lévi 1932a: 21, 輸迦 13, and in Ps V 9,12; for a reference to the Brahmin’s rebirth as a dog cf. also the 淨意 *Mahāvibhā�ā, T 1545 at T XXVII 521c29 (another reference in the same work to an element from the introductory narration in [[MA170]] at T I 704a17 can be found in T 1545 at T XXVII 903a 首迦 17). The Sogdian
fragment in Rosenberg 1920: 405 has the beginning of this narration, which unfortunately is all it has 首伽
preserved of the present discourse. On some vernacular elements found in this narration in the case of T
78 cf. Zürcher 1996: 14-17.
70 A sculptural representation of this event can be 谷 found in Foucher 1905: 525, which depicts the dog standing on a luxurious bed and angrily barking at the Buddha.
71 A brief statement to this effect is found in [[MN135]] at MN III 203,4, [[MA170]] at T I 704c26, T 79 at T I
889b21, T 80 at T I 891a25, T 81 at T I 896b25, T 755 at T XVII 588c29, in the Sanskrit Karmavibha�ga
in Kudo 2004: 26,5 and 27,7 or in Lévi 1932a: 30,3, in the Tibetan Karmavibha�ga in Lévi 1932a: 183,14,
and in the Karmavibha�ga-nāma-dharmagrantha at D (339) mdo sde, [[SA299]]a7 or Q (1006) shu 311a3,
which, however, does not report that Subha asked for a more detailed explanation. The Buddha’s short
reply on karma and Subha’s request for an explanation are not found in T 78. T 80 differs from the other
versions in as much as it does not record any question put by Subha, as in its version the Buddha rather
addressed Subha on his own accord. Demiéville 1924:146 note 3 points out that Mil 65,26 quotes this
statement in a form that corresponds to [[MN135]] at MN III 203,4 (cf. also the formulations in [[AN5.57]] at
AN III 74,30 and [[AN10.48]] at AN V 88,8) whereas the equivalent quote in the Chinese translation of
this work, T 1670B at T XXXII 714b7 (translated in Guang Xing 2007: 167), corresponds closer to the

understand the implications of this brief statement and requested a more detailed explanation.
The first illustration of this principle, given in the Cū�akammavibha�ga-sutta and its
parallels, takes up the case of killing living beings. [72] According to the Pāli version, the
retribution for killing will be rebirth in a lower world, or else, if the culprit is reborn as
a human being, he or she will be short-lived. [73] To abstain from killing leads to a heavenly rebirth, or else to a long life span if one is reborn as a human being.
Several of the Chinese versions differ from the presentation in the Pāli discourse in
so far as they do not seem to envisage human rebirth as an alternative to rebirth in hell
or heaven, but rather present it as something that apparently takes place only after one
has already been reborn in hell in retribution for killing or in heaven for abstaining from
killing. [74] Thus, their presentations give the impression that the act of killing definitely
leads to hell, just as to abstain from killing definitely leads to heaven.
In the Pāli account and in some other Chinese versions, however, the correlation of
these acts with these two modes of rebirth is less absolute, a difference that recurs also
in the subsequent treatments of other deeds and their karmic fruits. The Sanskrit and
Tibetan Karmavibha�gas and the Tibetan Karmavibha�ga-nāma-dharmagrantha agree
in this respect with the Cū�akammavibha�ga-sutta, as they also do not envisage that
killing inevitably will be followed by rebirth in hell. [75]
According to the detailed examination of karma and its fruit, given in the Mahākarmavibha�ga-sutta and in its Madhyama-āgama parallel, the working mechanism of
karma would in fact be of such complexity that it would be possible for someone who
has killed to be reborn in heaven (provided he or she has additionally done numerous
wholesome deeds), just as it would be possible for someone who abstains from killing


wording in [[MA170]] at T I 704c26. Krishan 1997: 60 notes that a comparable relationship between
former deeds and rebirth is established in the Kauśītaki Upani�ad 1.2, cf. Radhakrishnan 1953/1992:
754: te�u te�u sthāne�u pratyājāyate, yathā-karma, “in this or that condition he is born again according
to his deeds”.
72 Before turning to this first case, several versions offer a detailed breakdown of types of karma, examining its ripening from such perspectives as location and time of ripening, manner of ripening, etc., cf. T
80 at T I 891a29, T 81 at T I 896b29, the Sanskrit Karmavibha�ga in Kudo 2004: 26,8 and 27,11 (cf.
also id. 2006b: 56,18) or in Lévi 1932a: 30,5, the Tibetan Karmavibha�ga-nāma-dharmagrantha at D
(339) mdo sde, [[SA299]]b2 or Q (1006) shu 311a6, and the Khotanese version in Maggi 1995: 56,22.
73 [[MN135]] at MN III 203,16. According to the Jain Viyāhapa��atti 5.6.1 in Lalwani 1974: 182,2, harming
or killing living beings, speaking falsehood, and offering improper food to ascetics leads to a short life
span, cf. also the �hā�a�ga 3.133 in Jambūvijaya 1985: 49,3 and Krümpelmann 2006: 3.
74 [[MA170]] at T I 705a6+13, T 78 at T I 887c21+22, T 79 at T I 889c2+9, and T 755 at T XVII 589a9+14.
75 The Sanskrit Karmavibha�ga in Kudo 2004: 40,5, 41,5, and id. 2007: 94,22 or in Lévi 1932a: 33,10 and
the Tibetan Karmavibha�ga in Lévi 1932a: 184,26 do so explicitly by quoting a discourse according to
which killing can lead to rebirth in hell or in the animal realm, or among ghosts, or to short life among
humans. A similar presentation can be found in [[AN8.40]] at AN IV 247,8 and [[EA14.1]] at T II 576a18; cf.
also [[EA47.2]] at T II 781a12 and [[EA48.1]] at T II 785c25 (as well as [[EA52.8]] at T II 828b10, which only
mentions the retribution of having a short life span one being reborn as a human), with the positive case
of abstaining from killing and its result in a long life span taken up in [[EA14.2]] at T II 576a26.


Chapter 14 Vibha�ga-vagga                                    -  771


to be reborn in hell (provided he or she has additionally done numerous unwholesome
deeds). [76]
Two of the individual Chinese translations, the Sanskrit and Tibetan Karmavibha�gas, the Tibetan Karmavibha�ga-nāma-dharmagrantha, and the Khotanese version examine different types of relationship to the act of killing, such as undertaking the killing oneself, ordering someone else to do it, speaking in praise of killing, delighting on
seeing someone being killed, etc., all of which they explain to be conducive to a short
life span. [77] When applying the same detailed treatment to the positive counterpart of
abstaining from killing, the same versions mention such wholesome acts as rescuing a
being about to be killed, consoling a being afraid of dying, or caring for a being that is
sick and in pain. [78] The Sanskrit and Tibetan Karmavibha�gas further illustrate their
treatment by giving examples of how a deed of killing has led to a short life, narrating
the tale of someone who had instituted a cow sacrifice and in retribution was reborn
again and again as a cow to be sacrificed. [79]
The Cū�akammavibha�ga-sutta and its parallels indicate that harm inflicted on others
leads to being afflicted with disease oneself, while to abstain from harm and injury leads
to health. [80] Here, again, the two individual Chinese translations, the Sanskrit and Tibetan
Karmavibha�gas, the Tibetan Karmavibha�ga-nāma-dharmagrantha, and the Khotanese parallel offer additional perspectives, explaining that, for example, to give medicine
to the sick will lead to future health for oneself. [81]

76 [[MN136]] at MN III 209,28 and MN III 210,5, as well as [[MA171]] at T I 707a26+28. Mitchell 1975: 101
sums up that a certain “deed is a necessary condition for karmic reward, but not a sufficient condition”.

These versions adopt a pattern of treating each case in a tenfold manner by presenting ten aspects related to killing, followed by ten aspects related to refraining from killing,
etc. The same pattern can also be found in the Śuka-sūtra, although the fragments have not preserved the
part that corresponds to the topics of killing or abstention from killing.

the Tibetan Karmavibha�ga in Lévi 1932a: 184,4. When turning to the opposite case of how saving life
leads to longevity, the Sanskrit Karmavibha�ga in Kudo 2004: 44,2, 45,2, and id. 2007: 95,13 or in Lévi
1932a: 34,8 takes up the former good deeds that caused Baka Brahmā to possess long life, paralleling the

The Cū�akammavibha�ga-sutta and its parallels continue by taking up the cause for
ugliness, which they relate to anger and irritability in a former existence, while forbearance and patience lead to future beauty. [82] The more detailed treatments offered in the
two individual Chinese translations, the Sanskrit and Tibetan Karmavibha�gas, and the
Tibetan Karmavibha�ga-nāma-dharmagrantha note that to look down on others who
are ugly or even to deride them will also lead to becoming ugly oneself. [83]
The Cū�akammavibha�ga-sutta and its parallels next take up what prevents one from
being influential, which they explain to be the outcome of having been envious of the
honour and gains someone else had received. In contrast, rejoicing in the success of
others will lead to being influential in the future. [84] According to an individual Chinese
translation and the Śuka-sūtra, another cause for not being influential in the future is if
one looks down on someone who is of little influence. [85]

MN III 205 The Cū�akammavibha�ga-sutta next takes up wealth and poverty. In agreement with its
parallels, it relates wealth to giving food and requisites to recluses and Brahmins, while
those who did not make such offerings will be reborn in poverty. [86] The Madhyama-āgama
version, several individual Chinese translations, and the Sanskrit and Tibetan Karmavi

The same point is also made in [[AN8.19]] at AN II 203,14, to which [[AN5.148]] at AN III 172,11 adds
that to be full of faith when making offerings will also conduce to future beauty.

made in [[AN8.19]] at AN II 203,19. The fragments of the Śuka-sūtra in Hoernle 1916/1970: 48 set in
with the last of the deeds that lead to little influence, followed by the treatment of deeds that lead to
being influential. The deeds related to being influential or to being of no influence are not taken up at all
in T 78, which instead mentions lack of respect for elders and parents, cf. T 78 at T I 888a3.

high position, before taking up the reasons for future wealth.

bha�gas also mention giving to those who are poor and needy as a condition for being
reborn in an affluent condition. [87] According to the more detailed treatments in the two
individual Chinese translations, in the Sanskrit and Tibetan Karmavibha�gas, in the
Śuka-sūtra, in the Tibetan Karmavibha�ga-nāma-dharmagrantha, and in the Khotanese version, theft is another prominent condition for poverty in a future life. [88]
The Cū�akammavibha�ga-sutta and its parallels agree that arrogance leads to being
reborn in a low social position, whereas to be respectful is the cause for rebirth in a
high family. [89] One of the individual Chinese translations, together with the Sanskrit
and Tibetan Karmavibha�gas and the Śuka-sūtra, warns that to look down on those of
low families will lead to being reborn in a low family oneself. [90]
Regarding rebirth in a low condition due to pride, according to the Madhyama-āgama version’s introductory narration of the Buddha’s first meeting with Subha (after the
encounter with the dog while begging for alms) the Buddha had explained that the excessive pride of Subha’s father had been responsible for his rebirth as a dog, [91] a remark

Minh Chau 1964/1991: 31 takes this difference to exemplify a
greater emphasis given in the Chinese texts to compassion. However, the importance of giving to the
poor and needy, in addition to giving to recluses and Brahmins, is mentioned also in other Pāli discourses, cf., e.g., It 3:3:6 at It 65,10.

conduce to becoming wealthy in a future life. The relation of theft to future poverty is also highlighted
in [[AN8.40]] at AN IV 247,11, [[EA14.3]] at T II 576b6, [[EA47.2]] at T II 781a13, [[EA48.1]] at T II 785c28,

recorded as well in one of the individual translations. [92] Another individual translation
also mentions Subha’s father abusive speech as a factor that led to his low rebirth. [93]
Thus, out of the different deeds examined in the Cū�akammavibha�ga-sutta and its
parallels, according to these Chinese versions pride and abusive speech had caused the
rebirth of Subha’s father in a low position. Another of the individual translations and
the Pāli commentary add to this his former stinginess as a factor responsible for his
rebirth as a dog. [94]
The final topic in the Cū�akammavibha�ga-sutta is the cause for being wise. In agreement with its parallels, the Cū�akammavibha�ga-sutta explains that approaching recluses and Brahmins in order to learn what is wholesome and what is unwholesome
will lead to being reborn endowed with wisdom. In contrast, those who did not undertake such inquiries will be reborn as fools. [95] According to one of the individual Chinese translations, to despise someone for being a fool and to be unwilling to teach the
Dharma will also conduce to becoming a fool oneself in the future. [96] In order to avoid
being reborn as a fool, the Sanskrit and Tibetan Karmavibha�gas furthermore recommend abstinence from alcohol. [97]


92 T 79 at T I 889a6.
93 T 78 at T I 887b8 explains that Subha’s father had been reborn as a dog due to his abusive speech, and at
T I 887c2 relates his rebirth as a dog to his former pride.
94 T 81 at T I 896a17 mentions Subha’s father’s stinginess and also notes that he had no faith in the three
jewels. Ps V 9,3 reports the Buddha reflecting that Subha’s father had been reborn as a dog due to his
stinginess, todeyya brāhma�o dhanalobhena attano va ghare sunakho hutvā nibbatto. In [[MA170]] at T I
704b11, however, when told by the Buddha that his father had been reborn as a dog, Subha proclaimed
that his father had been a generous donor, . A similar remark by Subha is also found
in T 79 at T I 889a4 and in T 81 at T I 896a20, which in the case of T 81 appears to refer to offering sacrifices, as suggested also by the Sanskrit Karmavibha�ga in Kudo 2004: 14,7 and id. 2006a: 40,9 (cf.
also id. 2006b: 53,4) or in Lévi 1932a: 27,26. T 81 at T I 896a23 continues with a remark by the Buddha
that Subha’s father did not practise generosity. This suggests that perhaps the references to Subha’s father being a generous donor should be understood to intend only the making of offerings in the context
of Brahminical sacrifices, whereas when it came to giving on other occasions to recluses or the needy he
was stingy.
95 While according to [[MN135]] at MN III 205,28, [[MA170]] at T I 706a3, T 79 at T I 890c6, and T 755 at T
XVII 589c17 a central topic of this inquiry is the difference between what is wholesome and what is unwholesome, according to T 78 at T I 888a20 我父都提大行布施 the inquiry is about the path that leads to deliverance,
. In the Sanskrit Karmavibha�ga in Kudo 2004: 64,3, 65,2, and id. 2007: 102,22 or in Lévi 1932a:
41,24, as well as in the Tibetan Karmavibha�ga in Lévi 1932a: 187,29 the inquiry is about what should
better be done, which thus seems to correspond to the inquiry about what is wholesome and what is unwholesome, found in most versions. T 80 at T I 892c25, T 81 at 897b17, and the Tibetan Karmavibha�ga-nāma-dharmagrantha at D (339) mdo sde, [[SA302]]a6 or Q (1006) shu 314a4 do not mention the topic
of the inquiry at all. The relation between inquiring from recluses and future wisdom recurs in [[AN5.199]]
at AN III 244,26, which also does not specify the nature of the questions to be asked.

the Tibetan Karmavibha�ga in Lévi 1932a: 188,6. [[AN8.40]] at AN IV 248,9 broaches the same topic, ex- 度世

While several versions continue to explore the topic of karma and its retribution with
various other examinations, [98] the Cū�akammavibha�ga-sutta and most of its Chinese
parallels conclude their expositions at this point by summing up that beings are the heirs
of their own deeds, since through undertaking particular actions they will come to have
a particular quality or defect in the future. [99] One of the individual Chinese translations
illustrates this principle with the image of different seeds, which when planted will lead
to harvesting the type of grain that corresponds in nature to the seeds. [100] The Pāli discourse
and most of its parallels conclude with Subha taking refuge. [101]


[[MN136]] Mahākammavibha�ga-sutta

The Mahākammavibha�ga-sutta, the “greater discourse on an analysis of karma”, reveals the complexity of the ripening of karma. This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama. [102] Another parallel can be found in a discourse quotation in Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya, extant in Tibetan. [103]
The Mahākammavibha�ga-sutta and its parallels begin by describing that the wanderer Potaliputta visited the monk Samiddhi. [104] Potaliputta proclaimed to have person

quences of drinking are also described in [[EA14.9]] at T II 576c28, with the positive case of abstaining
from alcohol taken up in [[EA14.10]] at T II 577a8.

590a29, and the Tibetan Karmavibha�ga-nāma-dharmagrantha at D (339) mdo sde, [[SA310]]a7 or Q
(1006) shu 322a6. Although T 80 at T I 895b14 and the Tibetan Karmavibha�ga in Lévi 1932a: 214,29
do not explicitly speak of taking refuge, they nevertheless report that Subha had acquired faith and invited the Buddha to his house. In T 81 at T I 901b11, however, Subha only expressed his appreciation
by explaining that anyone who heard this exposition would derive great joy and benefit from it.
102 The parallel is [[MA171]] at T I 706b-708c, which agrees with [[MN136]] on the location and has the title
, which literally would be the “discourse on an analysis of great karma”, although the sense
would probably rather be a “great analysis of karma” or else a “greater discourse on an analysis of karma”; on [[MA171]] cf. also Minh Chau 1964/1991: 70, 131, and 199. A quotation from the present discourse in the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-(upadeśa-)śāstra, T 1509 at T XXV 238b15, cf. also Lamotte

ally heard the Buddha state that bodily and verbal actions are vain, as only mental action is real. [105] The Majjhima-nikāya and Madhyama-āgama versions report that Samiddhi told Potaliputta that this was a misrepresentation of the Buddha’s teaching, whereas
according to the Tibetan version he said that he had not heard this from the Buddha. [106]
According to the Chinese and Tibetan accounts, Samiddhi affirmed that the fruits of
deeds would be experienced, either in this world or in the next, [107] a statement not found
in the Pāli version.
The Mahākammavibha�ga-sutta and its parallels agree that Potaliputta asked Samiddhi in what way the fruition of action will be experienced. [108] Samiddhi replied that it
will be experienced as dukkha. [109] According to the Pāli and Tibetan versions, on hearing this reply Potaliputta got up and left without further ado.
In the Madhyama-āgama version, however, before leaving Potaliputta asked Samiddhi how long he had been ordained, to which Samiddhi replied that he had gone forth
only three years ago. The same question and reply are also found in the Pāli and Tibetan
versions, where they occur before the exchange on how intentional action will be experienced. [110]

MN III 208 The Mahākammavibha�ga-sutta continues by describing how Samiddhi approached
Ānanda and related the discussion he been having had with Potaliputta, on hearing
which Ānanda decided to report the whole matter to the Buddha. According to the Chinese and Tibetan versions, however, another monk had overheard the discussion between Samiddhi and Potaliputta and then reported the matter to Ānanda, whereon
Ānanda decided to inform the Buddha about what had happened.


105 D (4094) mngon pa, ju 262b5 or Q (5595) thu 5a5 differs in as much as here he also affirms that mental
action is fruitless, yid kyi las kyi ’bras bu med pa, presumably a textual error. Ps V 15,20 explains that
Potaliputta had come to the conclusion that according to the Buddha’s teaching only mental action is
real, since he had heard about (and misunderstood) the emphasis given by the Buddha to mental action
in the Upāli-sutta, [[MN56]] at MN I 373,19. Regarding Potaliputta’s reference to a statement by the Buddha about a state of concentration in which nothing is felt, according to the commentary this remark
originated from having heard about the exposition on abhisaññānirodha given in the Po��hapāda-sutta,
[[DN9]] at DN I 184,26. Premasiri 2006c: 739 comments that “the Buddha appears to have been known
among contemporary ascetics for his teaching concerning the cessation of saññā”.

that in [[MA171]] at T I 706c15 only takes the form of a mental reflection. 或
現世受, 或後世受


Chapter 14 Vibha�ga-vagga                                    -  777


The three versions report the Buddha clarifying that Samiddhi had answered in a onesided manner a question that should have been answered after carrying out an analysis. [111]
According to the Mahākammavibha�ga-sutta, the Buddha also pointed out that he
had never met Potaliputta, so that there was little ground for Potaliputta to claim that
he had heard anything directly from the Buddha.
The Pāli account indicates that at this point the monk Udāyī made the suggestion that
Samiddhi perhaps answered in this manner because he had in mind the Buddha’s statement that whatever is felt is included in dukkha. [112] The Chinese and Tibetan versions record a similar intervention, although according to their account it was Ānanda who
made this remark. [113]
The Mahākammavibha�ga-sutta and its parallels continue by clarifying that the appropriate answer to Potaliputta’s question would have been to explain that deeds leading to pleasant results will be felt as pleasant, just as deeds that lead to painful or neutral results will be experienced as painful or neutral.

6a8. The distinction between questions that require a one-sided answer and questions that require an
analysis recurs in [[AN5.55]] at AN I 197,19 and in its parallel [[MA119]] at T I 609a25; cf. also [[AN4.42]] at
AN II 46,5.

bhāsita�, ya� kiñci vedayita� ta� dukkhasmin ti (S [e] -[[MN388.9]] ya�)? In [[MN136]] at MN III 208,30,
the Buddha then remarks that he had already anticipated that the foolish Udāyī would interfere in this
improper manner, aññāsi� kho aha� ... idān’ evāya� ... moghapuriso ummujjamāno ayoniso ummujjissatī ti (S [e] -[[MN388.13]] ummujjissati without ti), translated by Chalmers 1927: 273 as “I knew in advance that this foolish person would pop up with a blunder”, by Gethin 2008: 197 as “this confused
person ... I knew just now that he was trying to come up with something and that he would come up
with the wrong idea”, by Horner 1959: 256 as “I ... knew that this foolish man Udāyin, opening up (this
question) now, would open it up to no purpose”, and by Ñā�amoli 1995/2005: 1059 as “I knew ... that
this misguided man ... would unduly interfere right now”, a remark without counterpart in the parallel
versions. The commentary further enhances the inappropriateness of Udāyin’s conduct by describing
that due to his wish to speak he got so agitated that he stretched his neck, moved his jaws, his face
started to twitch and he was unable to sit still, Ps V 17,2: kathetukāmo gīva� pagga�hāti, hanukañ
cāleti, mukham assa phandati, sannisīditu� na sakkoti.
113 [[MA171]] at T I 707a8 and D (4094) mngon pa, ju 263b6 or Q (5595) thu 6b1. [[SN36.11]] at SN IV 216,17
and its parallels [[SA473]] at T II 121a8 and [[SA474]] at T II 121a24 clarify the uncertainty another monk
had in regard to this statement about the relationship of all feelings to dukkha. These three discourses
clarify that the statement, according to which all feelings are included in dukkha, refers to their conditioned nature, not to their affective tone. That is, not all feelings are dukkha in the sense of being “suffering”, since some feelings are pleasant or neutral, but all feelings are dukkha in the sense of being ultimately “unsatisfactory”, because all feelings are conditioned and impermanent. Similar to [[MA171]] in
[[SA474]] the monk who inquires about this statement is Ānanda. The exposition in [[SN36.11]] at SN IV
217,14 and [[SA474]] at T II 121b8 culminates in the attainment of the cessation of perceptions and feelings, a topic that according to [[MN136]] at MN III 207,12 and [[MA171]] at T I 706b22 appears to have also
been on Potaliputta’s mind, as in his initial statement he had referred to a type of concentration during
which feelings cease.


778   •   A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya


MN III 209  The Majjhima-nikāya version continues with the Buddha remarking that foolish heterodox wanderers will be unable to understand the Buddha’s great analysis of karma, [114]
a remark not found in the parallel versions. According to the Mahākammavibha�gasutta, the Buddha continued by saying: “if you, Ānanda, would hear the detailed great
analysis on karma by the Tathāgata”, at which point the sentence stops. [115] The way this
sentence reads gives the impression that it has been truncated, since even though it begins with the hypothetical indeclinable “if”, sace, it ends without explaining what will
happen if Ānanda (and the monks) hear the detailed great analysis on karma.
The Madhyama-āgama parallel to this sentence supplies the missing part, indicating
that the monks and Ānanda would experience great joy if they were to hear this analysis. [116] In all versions, Ānanda understood the hint and requested that the Buddha expounds the greater analysis on karma.
This greater analysis on karma in the Mahākammavibha�ga-sutta and its parallels
takes up four possible cases:

       - someone engages in the ten unwholesome courses of action and is reborn in a
lower realm,

       - someone engages in the ten unwholesome courses of action and is reborn in a
heavenly realm,

       - someone abstains from the ten unwholesome courses of action and is reborn in a
heavenly realm,

       - someone abstains from the ten unwholesome courses of action and is reborn in a
lower realm.


114 [[MN136]] at MN III 209,10: “who are these stupid and foolish heterodox wanderers, that they should [be

karma, you would develop more and superior mental tranquillity and happiness towards the Tathāgata”,
(adopting the and variant reading
instead of ). Although D (4094) mngon pa, ju 264a4 or Q (5595) thu 6b8 does not start with an
“if” clause, but instead with a simple announcement of the impending exposition, it follows this with a
comparable passage on the effects of a delivery of such a teaching by the Tathāgata, de bzhin gshegs pa
las las rnam par ’byed pa chen po zhes bya ba’i chos kyi rnam grangs nyon cig dang bshad par bya’o.
In regard to a similar proclamation by the Buddha in [[AN6.62]] at AN III 404,5: sace tumhe, ānanda,
su�eyyātha tathāgatassa purisindriyañā�āni vibhajantassā ti (B [e] -AN II 353,20: vibhajissāmī ti), the
Madhyama-āgama counterpart, [[MA112]] at T I 601a15, also completes the sentence in a way closely
resembling [[MA171]] a reading which in
this case is, moreover, found similarly in another parallel to [[AN6.62]] T 58 at T I 854b7:
若汝從世尊聞分別大業經者, 於如來倍復增上心靖得喜 . If one were to attempt to restore the Pāli sen- 宋, 元, 明

The parallel versions differ in the sequence of their presentation of these four cases
(see table 14.1).
The three versions describe in similar terms how recluses or Brahmins, who witness
the performance of these actions and the subsequent rebirth through exercise of the divine eye, come to a dogmatic conclusion about the working mechanism of karma.
Those who witnessed evil conduct followed by a heavenly rebirth or good conduct
followed by rebirth in a lower realm come to the conclusion that there is no moral
retribution for good and evil deeds.
Those who witnessed evil conduct followed by rebirth in a lower realm or good conduct followed by rebirth in a heavenly realm instead come to the conclusion that there is
moral retribution for deeds, but then they also conclude that whosoever undertakes
good conduct will be reborn in a heavenly realm, while all those who undertake bad conduct will be reborn in a lower realm.


Table 14.1: Analysis of Karma and Rebirth in [[MN136]] and [[MA171]] [117]

|[[MN136]]|[[MA171]]|
|---|---|
|evil conduct leading to hell (1)<br>evil conduct leading to heaven (2)<br>good conduct leading to heaven (3)<br>good conduct leading to hell (4)|evil conduct leading to heaven (→ 2)<br>good conduct leading to hell (→ 4)<br>evil conduct leading to hell (→ 1)<br>good conduct leading to heaven (→ 3)|



The Mahākammavibha�ga-sutta and its parallels acknowledge that these recluses and
Brahmins speak from direct experience. Yet, in all four cases the dogmatic conclusions
of these recluses and Brahmins are not justified. Moreover, in the case of those who
witnessed evil conduct followed by heavenly rebirth and good conduct followed by rebirth in a lower realm, their assumption that there is no retribution for deeds at all is
mistaken.
The Mahākammavibha�ga-sutta explains that the heavenly rebirth of an evildoer
could be because of following reasons:

 - this person performed good deeds before doing the evil conduct that was witnessed by those recluses and Brahmins with the divine eye,

 - he performed good deeds after this evil conduct,

 - at the time of passing away he had right view. [118]


117 The present survey does not take into account the Tibetan version, as its presentation appears to have
suffered from a translation or transmission error, causing several irregularities.
118 [[MN136]] at MN III 214,20. [[MN136]] at MN III 214,14+25 and MN III 215,2+13 concludes each of its examinations of the four cases (evil or good conduct, combined with rebirth in a lower realm or in a heavenly realm) by stating that “he experiences the result either here and now, or on having been reborn, or
in another existence”, tassa di��he va dhamme vipāka� pa�isamvedeti uppajja� vā apare vā pariyāye
(B [e] -MN III 257,12 reads upapajja, while C [e] -MN III 454,37 and S [e] -MN III 397,11 read upapajje). Von
Hinüber 1971: 247 suggests to adopt apare va pariyāye instead of apare vā pariyāye, so that the resulting reading uppajja� vā apare va pariyāye would envisage only two alternatives for karmic fruition,



MN III 210

780   •   A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya


The Madhyama-āgama version explains that the heavenly rebirth of an evildoer
could be because of these reasons:

 - he already experienced the retribution for his evil conduct in his present life,

 - the retribution may be bound to ripen only in a future rebirth,

 - he performed good deeds before his evil conduct,

 - at the time of passing away he had right view. [119]


either in the present life or else on arising in a future existence. When examining a similar case in [[AN6.63]] at AN III 415,18, where the same type of statement is explicitly introduced as a “three-fold” distinction, tividhāha�, bhikkhave, kammāna� vipāka� vadāmi, von Hinüber 1971: 246-248 suggests to
adopt the variant reading imāha�. Von Hinüber’s reason for preferring imāha� to tividhāha� is that
other discourses usually distinguish only between di��hadhamma and samparāyika. Yet, this would not
necessarily exclude the possibility of a threefold presentation, since the next life and later lives together
fit under samparāyika, so that the threefold presentation could be understood as a more detailed analysis of the twofold exposition found in other discourses. In fact, the circumstance that in the present case
the term samparāyika is not used would support the impression that the present case is not a mere repetition of the distinction between di��hadhamma and samparāyika. That the present instance could be a
more detailed exposition of the same issue can also be seen in [[MA171]] at T I 706b27, which speaks of
deeds ripening in this world or in an afterworld, but then [[MA171]] at T I 708b17 takes up the possibility
that instead of affecting the next rebirth, a deed may have its effect only subsequent to that, thereby
showing how the threefold presentation acts as a more detailed exposition of the twofold mode within a
single discourse. The threefold mode seems to be in fact quite central to the exposition in [[MN136]]
whose purpose is to show that a particular deed done in the present life need not ripen in the next life.
To illustrate this, the threefold presentation would be quite to the point. Von Hinüber 1971: 246, however, on the assumption that the original treatment was only twofold, traces the threefold presentation
to [[AN15]] [th] century commentary on the Nettipakara�a and suggests that this reading influenced the wording in the Nettipakara�a, cf. Nett 37,21 and also Vism 601,2, as well as the wording of the discourses
(in addition to [[MN136]] and [[AN6.63]] other relevant instances are [[AN3.33]] at AN I 134,22 and [[AN10.206]]
at AN V 292,3). Von Hinüber 1978: 57 then concludes that the present case shows how “the very wording of the canon could be influenced by the scholastic views of the commentators living only a few centuries ago”, a conclusion accepted in turn by Norman 1997: 166. Yet, as von Hinüber 1971: 248 himself notes, the threefold presentation is also found in the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya, Abhidh-k 4:50 in Pradhan 1967: 229,21, and in the Mahāvyutpatti, no. 2309 in Sakaki 1926: 171 (Ch’en 1964: 110 notes a
reference in [[AN4]] [th] century Chinese treatise to the same threefold presentation as a teaching found in the
sūtras). In this case, von Hinüber suggests that a misunderstanding of a canonical text may have caused
these presentations. If the threefold presentation should indeed be the result of a misunderstanding, which
seems by no means certain, it would certainly be more natural to assume that out of variants in the formulation of the relevant passage in some discourses in the course of time the threefold understanding
developed, an understanding early enough to find its expression in works of different traditions alike,
than to assume that [[AN15]] [th] century commentary was able to influence the wording of the work on which
it commented and also the wording of the Pāli discourses, all the more when at the same time a similar
presentation is found in works that quite probably stand in no direct relation to this commentary. Thus,
instead of assuming that the wording of the canon has been influenced by recent commentaries, the existence of the same mode of presentation in the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya and in the Mahāvyutpatti suggests the more plausible explanation that the commentary on the Nettipakara�a only made more explicit
what was already found in the work on which it commented, instead of being itself the source of the
threefold mode of presentation.

The Tibetan version’s examination of the heavenly rebirth of an evildoer mentions
good deeds done in the past and right view at the time of passing away as possible
causes, affirming that the evil deeds will nevertheless have to be experienced, either
now or on being reborn. [120] A discourse quotation from a version of this part of the present discourse, found in the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-(upadeśa-)śāstra, sums up that
either the evil deed was not yet ripe and another wholesome deed was ripe, or else the
evildoer passed away with a wholesome state of mind. [121]
The three versions apply their respective treatments to the remaining three cases of a
particular conduct being followed by a particular rebirth, after which they give a summary of their exposition. The Madhyama-āgama version adds a simile to this summary,
which compares the complexity of the working mechanism of karma to a fruit that may
appear ripe but be unripe, appear unripe but be ripe, appear ripe and be ripe, or appear
unripe and be unripe. [122]


[[MN137]] Sa�āyatanavibha�ga-sutta

The Sa�āyatanavibha�ga-sutta, the “discourse on an analysis of the six sense-spheres”,
examines various aspects in relation to the six sense-spheres. This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama. [123] Parts of the present discourse have counterparts in
discourse quotations in Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya,
extant in Tibetan, [124] in addition to which a few lines have also been preserved in Sanskrit fragments. [125]
The Sa�āyatanavibha�ga-sutta begins by examining the following topics:


1993: 13 observes that “future schools of Buddhism ... placed increasing emphasis on the holding of
right views at the moment of death and ... considered this to be more important than living a moral life
in determining one’s future rebirth”.

122 [[MA171]] at T I 708c22 (D (4094) mngon pa, ju 268a6 or Q (5595) thu 11b2 ends right after listing the
four types of beings that in [[MA171]] introduce the simile of the fruit, so that it remains open to conjecture if the Tibetan version had such a simile. The use of, “to appear as”, “to resemble”, in the explanation and in the simile in [[MA171]] supports the second of two commentarial explanations found at Ps
V 20,6, according to which ºābhāsa in the compound bhabbābhāsa in the corresponding section in [[MN136]] at MN III 215,15 (which, however, does not have the simile) has the sense of “to appear”, cf. also
Bodhi in Ñā�amoli 1995/2005: 1347 note 1234. The simile of the four types of fruit can also be found
in [[AN4.06]] at AN II 106,27 and in the otherwise unrelated [[EA25.7]] at T II 634a18; for a Jain version of
this simile cf. �hā�a�ga 4.253 in Jambūvijaya 1985: 98,8.
123 The parallel is [[MA163]] at T I 692b-694b, which agrees with [[MN137]] on the location and on the title
( ). On [[MA163]] cf. also Minh Chau 1964/1991: 37.
124 Cf. below notes 129, 131, and 144.
125 The fragments are SHT VI 1252a (p. 49), SHT VII 1717 (p. 139), and the so far unpublished fragment 似
no. 2375/17 of the Schøyen collection, identified by Peter Skilling (I am indebted to Jens-Uwe Hartmann for kindly providing me with a preliminary draft transliteration of these fragments). The three
fragments are parallels to the exposition of the three satipa��hānas found in [[MN137]] at MN III 221,3.

 - the six senses,

 - the six sense-objects,

 - the six types of consciousness,

 - the six types of contact.
The Madhyama-āgama version differs in so far as it only examines the six senses and
the six corresponding types of contact. [126] In relation to these six types of contact, while
the Majjhima-nikāya version takes up contact only from the perspective of the corresponding sense-organ, [127] the Madhyama-āgama treatment also takes into account the
sense-objects. [128]
The two parallel versions continue by turning to eighteen types of mental exploration, [129] which arise based on pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral sense-objects. [130] Both
versions proceed from this eighteen-fold treatment to an analysis of experience from
thirty-six perspectives. [131] The Majjhima-nikāya version approaches this thirty-six-fold
analysis by distinguishing between experiences that are worldly and experiences that

126 [[MN137]] at MN III 216,1 lists “six internal spheres ... six external spheres ... six groups of consciousness ... six groups of contact”, cha ajjhattikāni āyatanāni ... cha bāhirāni āyatanāni ... cha viññā�akāyā

, thereby qualifying the knowing to be ‘internal’. [[MA163]] has been using the same
qualification in its previous treatment of the six spheres and of the six types of contact; it continues to
speak of knowing “internally” in relation to the thirty-six-fold examination that comes next. This mode
of presentation fits the absence of an explicit listing of the six external sense-spheres in [[MA163]] since
a consistent qualification of all items as something that should be known ‘internally’ would not have
been applicable in the same manner to the ‘external’ sense-spheres.

pertain to renunciation. [132] The Madhyama-āgama version uses slightly different terminology to make the same point, as it distinguishes between experiences based on attachment and experiences based on renunciation. [133] The same is the case for a discourse
quotation from Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya that parallels the present section. [134]
The Sa�āyatanavibha�ga-sutta and its Chinese and Tibetan parallels apply their respective negative category (i.e., “worldly” or “based on attachment”) to the following:

  - the pleasure derived from sense-objects,

  - the sadness that arises from not obtaining pleasurable sense-objects,

  - the indifference of the fool towards sense-objects.
In contrast, what pertains to renunciation are:

  - the pleasure that arises from insight into the true nature of sense-objects,

  - the sadness that arises from yearning for liberation,

  - the equanimity that arises from insight into the true nature of sense-objects.
Although agreeing in their analysis, the three versions differ in the sequence of their
presentation. The Pāli version first works through the worldly pleasures in relation to
all six sense-objects, after which it takes up the pleasures of renunciation in relation to
all six sense-objects. The Chinese and Tibetan versions instead take up each sense-object from both perspectives, before turning to the next sense-object (see table 14.2).
When examining the two types of equanimity, the Pāli version explains that worldly
equanimity does not transcend sense-objects, while the equanimity of renunciation
does transcend sense-objects. [135] The Chinese version formulates this in a slightly different manner, explaining that equanimity based on attachment is not separated from
its object, whereas equanimity based on renunciation is the outcome of mental development. [136] The Tibetan version distinguishes between equanimity based on attachment


132 [[MN137]] at MN III 217,8 refers to “thirty-six positions of beings”, chatti�sa sattapadā. [[MA163]] at T I
692c16 instead speaks of “thirty-six knives”,, an expression perhaps due to mistaking satta

a variant reading that has instead of ). The corresponding expression in Abhidh-k 3:36 in Pradhan 1967: 150,8 reads �a�tri�śac chāst�padāni, “thirty-six positions [set forth] by the teacher” (rendered by Pruden 1988: 437 as “thirty-six points of the Master”), which thus has satthar or śāst� instead
of satta or sattva, an expression found similarly in Xuánzàng’s ( ) translation, T 1558 at T XXIX

that has not given up its object and equanimity based on renunciation by having undertaken an analysis. [137] In spite of differing formulations, the three versions make the same
point, since it is precisely through mental development and analysis that the transcendence of the sense-objects will be reached.

MN III 220 The Sa�āyatanavibha�ga-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama counterpart recommend
leaving the three worldly types of experience behind by relying on their counterparts
that are based on renunciation. The Pāli version continues by recommending the pleasure of renunciation as the means to go beyond the sadness of renunciation, followed by
presenting the equanimity of renunciation as the means to go beyond the pleasure of renunciation.
The Madhyama-āgama version agrees with the Majjhima-nikāya presentation on
reckoning the equanimity of renunciation as the culmination point, it differs, however,
in regard to the preceding step, as, instead of recommending the use of the pleasure of
renunciation to go beyond the sadness of renunciation, it advocates the use of the sadness of renunciation to go beyond the pleasure of renunciation. [138] On applying the explanations given in both versions to this difference, the Pāli version thus recommends
to go beyond the yearning for liberation through developing the joy of insight, while
the Chinese version enjoins to go beyond the joy of insight through developing yearning for liberation.
The Pāli and Chinese versions next turn to diversified and unified types of equanimity, which stand for equanimity in relation to the sense-objects and the equanimity of

the immaterial attainments. [139] The two versions present the unified type of equanimity
as the means to go beyond the diversified type of equanimity. The Pāli discourse stands
alone in recommending non-identification for going beyond unified equanimity. [140]
The Madhyama-āgama version continues by highlighting that the Buddha’s teaching
of the Dharma is inexhaustible, since it could not be covered exhaustively even if he
should continuously teach four disciples for a period of a hundred years. [141] The same
image recurs in the Mahāsīhanāda-sutta, where it illustrates the Buddha’s teaching of
the four satipa��hānas. [142]
The Sa�āyatanavibha�ga-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel continue by taking
up the Buddha’s practice of three satipa��hānas, [143] an exposition also preserved in a
discourse quotation in Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya. [144]


139 [[MN137]] at MN III 220,22 contrasts equanimity that is nānatta nānattasita with equanimity that is ekatta ekattasita, while [[MA163]] at T I 693b23 contrasts equanimity “with boundless contacts, with diversified contacts”,, with equanimity “with a single contact, without diversified contacts”, .

e.g., [[EA8.6]] at T II 561b21, [[EA12.1]] at T II 568a4, [[EA26.9]] at T II 639b7, [[EA28.3]] at T II 650b19, [[EA41.3]] at T II 745b15, [[EA41.4]] at T II 746a8, [[EA47.7]] at T II 783a21, and [[EA49.1]] at T II 794b11 (the

786   •   A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya


These three satipa��hānas stand for the Buddha’s attitude towards three types of situation:

 - his disciples do not listen to his teaching and do not follow it,

 - some disciples do not listen to and do not follow his teaching, while others listen
to and follow his teaching,

 - his disciples listen to and follow his teaching.
The parallel versions differ in the sequence in which they present these three situations (see table 14.3). They also differ in the way they depict the Buddha’s reaction to
these three situations. According to the Pāli version’s presentation:

 - when all disciples do not listen, the Buddha is not satisfied,

 - when some listen, the Buddha is neither satisfied nor dissatisfied,

 - when all listen, the Buddha is satisfied. [145]
According to the Chinese and Tibetan accounts, however, the Buddha maintains
equanimity in all three cases, as he is not sad when all disciples do not listen, he is
neither sad nor joyful when some listen and some do not listen, and he is not joyful
when all listen. [146]
Hence, while in the Pāli version there is a difference in the Buddha’s attitude depending on whether his disciples listen or not, in the parallel versions he remains equanimous in all three cases. The Abhidharmakośabhā�ya, the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-(upadeśa-)śāstra, the *Mahāvibhā�ā, and the Mahāvyutpatti agree with the Madhyamaāgama presentation, as according to these works the Buddha’s attitude in these three
cases is invariably the same. [147]

he dwells without being defiled by it”, na c’ eva attamano hoti na ca attamanata� pa�isa�vedeti, anavassuto ca viharati, although in this case the Burmese edition rather indicates that “he is not dissatisfied and feels no dissatisfaction”, B [e] -MN III 263,22: na c’ eva anattamano hoti na ca anattamanata�
pa�isa�vedeti. [[MN137]] at MN III 221,21 (some listen and some do not listen): “he is not satisfied and
feels no satisfaction, and he is not dissatisfied and feels not dissatisfaction, leaving behind both satisfaction and dissatisfaction he dwells in equanimity”, na c’ eva attamano hoti na ca attamanata� pa�isa�vedeti, na ca anattamano hoti na ca anattamanata� pa�isa�vedeti, attamanatañ ca anattamanatañ
ca tad ubhaya� abhinivajjetvā so upekhako viharati (B [e] -MN III 264,1 follows the opposite sequence in
so far as it begins with na c’ eva anattamano hoti, etc., followed by na ca attamano hoti, etc., and then
in the third part reads anattamanatā ca attamanatā ca tad ubhaya�, etc.; B [e], C [e] -MN III 466,31, and S [e]  MN III 408,15 read upekkhako, B [e] and S [e] also do not have so). [[MN137]] at MN III 221,30 (all listen):
“he is satisfied and feels satisfaction, yet he dwells without being defiled by it”, attamano c’ eva hoti
attamanatañ ca pa�isa�vedeti, anavassuto ca viharati. Since during transmission the negative and positive forms in this highly repetitive passage could easily have become confused with each other, perhaps
the statement should rather be that in case all disciples do not listen he is not displeased with that, na
anattamano hoti, the reading found in B [e], and in case all disciples listen he is not pleased with that, na
attamano hoti, in line with the presentation in [[MA163]] cf., however, also Cicuzza 2004: 401.

59b3 or Q (5595) thu 101b4, 101b8, and 102a5; cf. also Anālayo 2012h. In all three cases, just as in [[MN137]] the Buddha is endowed with mindfulness and clear comprehension.

This form of presentation would also receive support from a discourse in the Sa�yutta-nikāya, according to which the Buddha’s attitude when instructing was free from
attraction or repulsion. [148]

The Pāli and Chinese versions conclude by describing the Buddha’s incomparable
leadership of beings, contrasting the ability of an animal trainer to teach an elephant, a
horse, or an ox how to move in one of the four directions with the Buddha’s ability to
teach his disciples how to approach eight ‘directions’ by attaining the eight liberations. [149]


[[MN138]] Uddesavibha�ga-sutta

The Uddesavibha�ga-sutta, the “discourse on a summary and [its] analysis”, records
Mahākaccāna’s explanation of how to avoid getting distracted externally or stuck internally, as well as how to avoid agitation. This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyamaāgama. [150] Parts of the introductory narration of the Uddesavibha�ga-sutta have also been
preserved in a Sanskrit fragment. [151]
The Uddesavibha�ga-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel begin with a brief
statement by the Buddha, which highlights that, in order to go beyond birth, old age,
and death, one needs to investigate in a way that avoids the following:

cf. also the *Tattvasiddhi, T 1646 at T XXXII 243a1 (which only explicitly examines the two cases
where attention is being paid and where no attention is being paid to what the Buddha teaches). Another occurrence can be found in a bilingual Sanskrit and Uighur fragment, which has preserved parts
of the third sm�tyupasthāna, where the Buddha also just remains equanimous, cf. Maue 2008: 181.

149 [[MN137]] at MN III 222,12 and [[MA163]] at T I 694a27, parts of this comparison have also been preserved
in fragment no. 2375/17 of the Schøyen collection. On the conception of the eight liberations cf., e.g.,
Anālayo 2009q, Bronkhorst 1993/2000: 80-82, Hurvitz 1979, and Lamotte 1970a: 1281-1283.
150 The parallel is [[MA164]] at T I 694b-696b, which agrees with [[MN138]] on the location and has the title
“discourse on an analysis of contemplating [according to] the Dharma”, . A brief survey of
[[MN138]] can be found in Anālayo 2008j.
151 The Sanskrit fragment is SHT V 1141 (p. 138, identified in SHT VIII p. 196), which parallels the description of how the monks approached Mahākaccāna in order to get a detailed exposition of the short
saying by the Buddha, found in [[MN138]] at MN I 223-224.

 - being distracted externally,

 - getting internally stuck,

 - becoming agitated. [152]
Having made this concise statement, according to both versions the Buddha retired to
his dwelling.
From the perspective of the Majjhima-nikāya discourse this is puzzling, since according to its account the Buddha had announced that he would teach the monks a summary
and an analysis. [153] Yet, in spite of this announcement, he left after teaching only the summary, without providing an analysis.
The Madhyama-āgama account, however, does not report that the Buddha had made
an announcement that he was about to teach a summary and an analysis to the monks.
Thus, in the Madhyama-āgama version, the Buddha’s departure does not stand in contradiction to what he earlier announced.
A similar introductory statement on a summary and an analysis recurs also in four
other discourses in this chapter of the Majjhima-nikāya, which are:

 - the Bhaddekaratta-sutta, [154]

 - the Ānandabhaddekaratta-sutta, [155]


152 [[MN138]] at MN III 223,9 describes these conditions for liberation to be that “consciousness is not distracted or scattered externally”, bahiddhā ... viññā�a� avikkhitta� avisa�a�, it is not “stuck internally”,
ajjhatta� asa��hita�, and “by not clinging it would not be agitated”, anupādāya na paritasseyya. [[MA164]] at T I 694b22 explores the same conditions under the headings “the mind is not scattered by not
moving outwards”,, “the mind is settled inwardly”,, and “by not clinging it is
not agitated”, . Thus, while [[MN138]] examines the danger of getting “stuck internally”, [[MA164]] enjoins to let the mind be “settled inwardly”. The same difference underlies their subsequent treatments of this topic, which in both versions takes up attachment to the pleasure of the jhānas. While in
[[MN138]] at MN III 226,15 to have such attachment leads to the mind being “internally stuck”, ajjhatta�
sa��hita�, in [[MA164]] at T I 695a26, due to such attachment, the mind or consciousness is “not settled
inwardly”, . In its general usage in the discourses, sa��hita often occurs in similar contexts with
predominantly positive connotations, cf., e.g., [[MN119]] at MN III 89,22: ajjhattam eva citta� santi��hati, or [[MN121]] at MN III 105,7: citta� pakkhandati pasīdati santi��hati, or [[SN46.6]] at SN V 74,7: citta�
ajjhatta� susa��hita�. This general usage and the instruction in [[MA164]] suggest the possibility that
the stipulation in [[MN138]] could originally have intended that consciousness should be inwardly settled, 心不出外不灑散 心住內
ajjhatta� sa��hita� 不受不恐怖, instead of ajjhatta� asa��hita�. However, the reading asa��hita� receives support from It 3:5:5 at It 94,2, where a similar instruction indicates qualifies viññā�a� avikkhitta� as
being ajjhatta� asa��hita�. Johansson 1979/1985: 62 interprets the reading asa��hita� as implying
that one should “not wish for and build a certain type of future life”, i.e., as a way of getting stuck internally because of one’s aspirations and plans.

 - the Mahākaccānabhaddekaratta-sutta, [156]

 - the Lomasaka�giyabhaddekaratta-sutta. [157]
In the case of the Mahākaccānabhaddekaratta-sutta and the Lomasaka�giyabhaddekaratta-sutta this reference to a summary and its analysis is partially redundant, since
according to the introductory narration in both discourses a deva visited a monk and
asked him if he knew the stanzas on the auspicious night and then again asked him if
he knew their summary and analysis. [158] As the stanzas correspond to the summary, to
speak of a summary in addition to the stanzas appears to be superfluous.
In the case of the Mahākaccānabhaddekaratta-sutta, this reference to a summary and
an analysis is not only redundant, but even stands in contradiction to the remainder of
the discourse, since here the Buddha agrees to a monk’s request to be taught a summary and an analysis, but then also gets up and leaves, after giving only a summary,
without continuing to deliver the corresponding analysis. [159] Thus, both the Mahākaccānabhaddekaratta-sutta and the Uddesavibha�ga-sutta record that the Buddha announces an analysis, but then leaves without giving it. As in both cases the Chinese
versions do not refer to such an analysis, one might wonder if the reference to a summary and an analysis could be a later addition to these discourses.
Exploring this hypothesis, perhaps the reason for this reference to a summary and an
analysis could be that the basic pattern of following a summary with an analysis is a
characteristic mark of almost all discourses found in the present “chapter on analyses”,
the Vibha�ga-vagga. The Sa�āyatanavibha�ga-sutta, the Ara�avibha�ga-sutta, and the
Dhātuvibha�ga-sutta explicitly identify their respective introductory statements as a
summary, followed by its corresponding analysis. [160] The Cū�akammavibha�ga-sutta,
the Mahākammavibha�ga-sutta, and the Saccavibha�ga-sutta also follow a summary
statement with a detailed analysis, although without explicitly introducing this pattern
as a summary and an analysis. [161] Except for the last discourse in this chapter, the Dak
156 In [[MN133]] at MN III 192,10, a deva asks a monk: “do you remember the summary and analysis on an
auspicious night”, dhāresi ... bhaddekarattassa uddesañ ca vibha�gañ cā ti?
157 In [[MN134]] at MN III 199,27, a deva asks a monk: “do you remember the summary and analysis on an
auspicious night”, dhāresi .. bhaddekarattassa uddesañ ca vibha�gañ cā ti?
158 In addition to the inquiries mentioned above, according to [[MN133]] at MN III 192,16 and [[MN134]] at
MN III 200,5, the deva asked: “do you remember the verses on the auspicious night”, dhāresi ... bhaddekarattiyo gāthā ti?
159 In relation to [[MN138]] Bodhi in Ñā�amoli 1995/2005: 1349 note 1249 comments that “it is strange that
the Buddha, having announced that he will teach a summary and an exposition, should recite only the
summary and leave without giving the exposition”.

282,17: dhātuvibha�gassa).
161 In [[MN135]] at MN III 203,10, Subha requests a teaching so that he “might know the detailed meaning of
what had been said in short”, sa�khittena bhāsitassa ... vitthārena attha� ājāneyyan ti (B [e] -MN III 244,6:
sa�khittena). [[MN136]] at MN III 209,2 similarly proceeds from a succinct statement to its analysis, the
mahākammavibha�ga, although without introducing this pattern explicitly. [[MN141]] at MN III 248,4 begins with a succinct statement by the Buddha, which then receives a detailed exposition by Sāriputta.

khi�āvibha�ga-sutta, all discourses in the Vibha�ga-vagga share the feature of proceeding from a summary statement to its detailed analysis. [162]
This characteristic pattern would give a strong sense of cohesion and connectedness
to this group of discourses during oral transmission. In fact, nine counterparts to the
discourses found in the Vibha�ga-vagga of the Majjhima-nikāya occur in the corresponding chapter in the Madhyama-āgama. [163] This is a remarkably high correspondence, as the two collections have only four chapters at all in common. Out of these
four chapters, two chapters have each four discourses in common and one chapter has
only two discourses in common with its counterpart. [164] Thus, for the Majjhima-nikāya
chapter on “analyses” and the Madhyama-āgama chapter on “analyses” to share nine
discourses is indeed remarkable, suggesting that the pattern of following a summary by
an analysis formed a strong bond that kept this group of discourses together in the two
reciter traditions.
In view of this strong group identity, perhaps during the oral transmission of the discourses now collected in the Majjhima-nikāya this implicit pattern became more explicit, in the sense that the reciters may have begun some discourses with the announcement that a summary and its analysis will be given. Such an announcement could have
originated from a remark just meant as an aid to help the reciters be aware of this characteristic shared by this group of discourses. In the course of time, this announcement
may then have ended up becoming part of the discourse, thereby creating a redundancy
in the case of the Mahākaccānabhaddekaratta-sutta and the Lomasaka�giyabhaddekaratta, as well as an internal inconsistency in the case of the Mahākaccānabhaddekaratta-sutta and the Uddesavibha�ga-sutta.

MN III 224  Whatever may be the last word on the references to a summary and its analysis in
these discourses, the Uddesavibha�ga-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel continue by describing that, once the Buddha had given only a summary statement, the
monks approached Mahākaccāna and asked him to give a detailed analysis of this succinct statement.

MN III 225  According to both versions, Mahākaccāna explained that, when the mind follows after
the sign of the sense-object and gets attached to the gratification derived from that sign,
it becomes distracted externally. [165]


162 As noted in Willemen 1998: 170, the procedure of following a brief doctrinal statement (uddesa) with a
detailed elaboration, observed in most discourses of the Vibha�ga-vagga, foreshadows Abhidharma
catechesis.
163 This is the thirteenth chapter in the Madhyama-āgama, the (the title would correspond to
Mūlavibha�ga-vagga), which contains the counterparts to [[MN132]] [[MN133]] [[MN134]] [[MN135]] [[MN136]] [[MN137]] [[MN138]] [[MN139]] and [[MN140]] although in a different sequence.
164 Cf. above p. 8 table 0.1.
165 In the case of visible form, [[MN138]] at MN III 225,19 describes how “consciousness follows after the
sign of form, is tied to the gratification [derived from] the sign of form, is bound to the gratification

[derived from] the sign of form, is fettered by the fetter of gratification [derived from] the sign of form”,

After applying the same treatment to the complementary case of not getting dis- MN III 226
tracted externally, the Uddesavibha�ga-sutta and its parallel warn against attachment
to the jhānas, [166] describing the danger of succumbing to the gratification experienced
through the four jhānas. [167] The Madhyama-āgama discourse differs from the Majjhi

tānusāri, B [e] and S [e] : ºgadhita� and ºvinibandha�, C [e] and S [e] : ºsaññojanasa�yutta�). [[MA164]] at T I
695a11 depicts the same in the following manner: “consciousness feeds on the sign of form, consciousness attaches to the pleasure of the sign of form, consciousness is fettered by the pleasure of the sign of
form”,, concluding that “being fettered to the gratification [derived from] the sign of form, the mind has gone out externally and is scattered”,
. The reference to the ‘sign’ in this context brings to mind the standard instructions for senserestraint, which similarly enjoin that a practitioner should avoid taking up the sign in order to steer
clear of unwholesome mental reactions, cf., e.g., [[MN107]] at MN III 2,14: “don’t grasp the sign”, mā
nimittaggāhī, and its counterpart in [[MA144]] at T I 652b12: “yet, don’t grasp the sign”, .
166 In relation to the first jhāna, [[MN138]] at MN III 226,12 applies the same series of expressions it had used
earlier in relation to the sign of sense-objects, i.e., “consciousness follows after the happiness and rapture of seclusion, is tied to the gratification [derived from] the happiness and rapture of seclusion, is
bound to the gratification [derived from] the happiness and rapture of seclusion, is fettered by the fetter
of gratification [derived from] the happiness and rapture of seclusion 識食色相, 識著色樂相, 識縛色樂相 ”, vivekajapītisukhānusārī viññā�a� hoti vivekajapītisukhassādagathita� vivekajapītisukhassādavinibaddha� vivekajapītisukhassāda- 彼色相味結縛, 心

adopts a pattern that differs from its earlier examination of sense-objects, as in relation to the pleasure
of the first jhāna it describes that “consciousness is attached to the gratification [derived from] seclu- 然不受相
sion, depends on it, is established in it, is conditioned by it, and is fettered by it”,
, . The two versions agree on using the term “mind”, citta/, in the heading for this
section, cf. [[MN138]] at MN III 226,9 (except for B [e] -MN III 268,26, which has neither citta nor viññā�a
in this sentence) and [[MA164]] at T I 695a23, while the actual exposition employs the term “consciousness”, viññā�a/ . In its introductory section, [[MA164]] at T I 694b20 already makes use of the expression “mind”, while the corresponding part in [[MN138]] at MN III 223,10 speaks of “consciousness”; cf.
also Vetter 2000: 69. Thus, these two expressions are used as near synonyms in both versions, a usage
found (together with manas) also in [[DN1]] at DN I 21,21 and its Tibetan counterpart sems ... yid ... rnam
par shes pa in Weller 1934: 26,22. Another example of such concurrent occurrence can be found in [[SN12.61]] at SN II 94,13 and its parallels [[SA289]] at T II 81c7 and fragment [[SN474]] folio 5V3 in Tripā�hī
1962: 30. Yet another example occurs in the Catu�pari�at-sūtra and its parallels, cf. fragments [[SN360]] 彼識著離味, 依彼,
住彼 folio 100R 緣彼, 5-6 縛彼 and [[SN362]] (61)R7 in Waldschmidt 1952: 17 and 36, with its Chinese counterpart in T 心
1450 at T XXIV 134b14 and its Tibetan counterpart in Waldschmidt 1962: 321,10. In the general usage
of these two terms in the Pāli discourses, however, viññā�a and citta take on different shades of meanings. Bodhi 2000: 769 note 154 succinctly explains that 識 “viññā�a signifies the particularizing awareness through a sense faculty ... as well as the underlying stream of consciousness, which sustains personal continuity through a single life and threads together successive lives”, whereas “citta signifies
mind as the centre of personal experience, as the subject of thought, volition and emotion”; cf. also

167 [[MN138]] at MN III 226,13+20+27+34 examines the gratification derived from the happiness and rapture
of seclusion (of the first jhāna), vivekajapītisukhassāda, from the happiness and rapture of concentration (of the second jhāna), samādhijapītisukhassāda, from the equanimity and happiness (of the third

ma-nikāya version in as much as it extends its treatment also to the gratification to be
derived from the four immaterial attainments. [168]

MN III 227  Both discourses turn to the complementary case, when jhāna practice is undertaken
without succumbing to attachment. This complementary treatment in both versions
makes it clear that it is not the practice and development of jhāna itself, but only the
wrong attitude to it that comes in for criticism.
The Uddesavibha�ga-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel continue by examining
how agitation can arise. According to the Majjhima-nikāya version, agitation arises when
in regard to any of the five aggregates one has one of the following notions:

       - the aggregate is the self,

       - the self possesses the aggregate,

       - the aggregate is in the self,

       - the self is in the aggregate. [169]
Once the aggregate changes and becomes otherwise, agitation arises due to clinging
to the aggregate.
The Madhyama-āgama version approaches the same topic in a slightly different manner, as instead of taking up the twenty modes of construing a sense of self, covered in
the Majjhima-nikāya version, [170] it describes how someone becomes attached to and
mentally established in an aggregate, considering it as ‘I’ and ‘mine’. Such attachment
then results in agitation as soon as the respective aggregate changes and becomes oth
jhāna), upekhāsukhassāda (B [e] -MN III 269,12, C [e] -MN III 476,17, and S [e] -MN III 417,3: upekkhāsukhassāda), and from the neutral feeling (of the fourth jhāna), adukkhamasukhassāda. [[MA164]] at T I 695a25+28
and T I 695b3+6 similarly takes up the gratification [derived from] seclusion,, the gratification [derived from] concentration,, the gratification [derived from] the absence of rapture,, and
the gratification [derived from] equanimity together with purity of mindfulness, .
168 In the case of the four immaterial attainments, [[MA164]] at T I 695 b9+12+14+17 mentions the “gratification [derived from] knowledge of space”,, the “gratification [derived from] knowledge of consciousness”,, the “gratification [derived from] knowledge of nothingness”,, and
the “gratification [derived from] knowledge of the absence of perception”, .
169 [[MN138]] at MN III 227,26 introduces this exposition as “agitation due to not clinging”, anupādā paritassanā, a reading also found in its counterpart in [[MA164]] at T I 695c19: “not clinging [there] is agitation”, . This reading does not fit the context and one would rather expect the heading to be
“agitation due to clinging”. Bodhi in Ñā�amoli 1995/2005: 1350 note 1253 comments that 離味 “this reading apparently predates the commentaries, for [the commentary] accepts 定味 anupādā as correct 無喜味 ”. The occurrence of the same expression in [[MA164]] reinforces the impression that this reading is quite early, 捨及念清淨味
suggesting that an error occurred at an early stage in the transmission of the discourse. Bodhi draws
attention to [[SN22.7]] at SN III 16,3, where a similar treatment uses the heading 空智味 upādā paritassanā,
based on which he concludes that 識智味 “we may safely infer that the Majjhima reading is an ancient error 無所有智味
that should be discounted”. Horner 1959: 275 note 4 also follows [[SN22.7]] against the reading found in 無想智味
[[MN138]] The parallel to [[SN22.7]] [[SA43]] at T II 10c22, does indeed speak of “clinging”, although it relates this to attachment instead of agitation, .
170 Another minor difference is that [[MN138]] at MN III 227, 不受而恐怖 27 begins its treatment by speaking of the unlearned worldling, followed by taking up the learned noble disciple for its complementary examination
of the absence of agitation in [[MN138]] at MN III 228,11. Instead of contrasting the unlearned worldling
with the noble disciple, [[MA164]] at T I 659c19 and T I 696a8 has in both cases as its subject a monk.

erwise. [171] The two versions continue by applying their respective treatments to the
complementary case of not becoming agitated due to not clinging. [172]
The Uddesavibha�ga-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel conclude with the
monks reporting Mahākaccāna’s exposition to the Buddha, who approved of it and
lauded Mahākaccāna’s wisdom.


[[MN139]] Ara�avibha�ga-sutta

The Ara�avibha�ga-sutta, the “discourse on an analysis of non-conflict”, examines
various ways of avoiding conflict. This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama. [173] A section of this discourse has also been preserved in a Sanskrit fragment. [174]
The Ara�avibha�ga-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel begin by examining the
need to avoid both the pursuit of sensual pleasures and the practice of self-mortification, recommending the noble eightfold path as the middle path that is aloof from these
two extremes. [175]
The two versions reckon the pursuit of sensual pleasures to be a low practice of the
commoner, while the practice of self-mortification is according to them ignoble and


171 In the case of the aggregate of form, [[MA164]] at T I 695c21 depicts attachment in the following way:
“he is not separated from defilement in regard to form, not separated from desire in regard to form, not
separated from craving in regard to form, not separated from thirst in regard to form, he wishes to obtain form, searches for form, is attached to form, established in form, he [considers] ‘form, then, is me’,
‘form is mine’”,
, with the result that “consciousness grabs and takes hold of form”, .
172 In both versions, Mahākaccāna concludes by repeating the statement made by the Buddha, with the minor difference that, according to [[MN138]] at MN III 228,32, he referred to this statement as a statement
made “to us” (no): ya� kho no, āvuso, bhagavā sa�khittena uddesa� uddisitvā (B [e] -MN III 271,16: sa�khittena), whereas in [[MA164]] at T I 696a27 he just speaks of the statement made by the Buddha,
. As according to both versions Mahākaccāna had not been present during the delivery
of this statement by the Buddha, the use of the plural personal pronoun no does not fit the context and
may be due to the reciters just repeating the same formulation used earlier in the reflection of the monks
about who could explain this statement, a reflection that appropriately speaks of the statement made by
the Buddha “to us 不離色染, ”. The same difference recurs between [[MN18]] at MN I 111, 不離色欲, 不離色愛, 不離色渴者, 彼欲得色, 求色, 31 and its parallels MĀ 著色, 住色, 色即是
我, 115 at T I 604c 色是我有 3 and [[EA40.10]] at T II 743b11, as well as between [[MN133]] at MN III 195, 識捫摸色 24 and its parallel [[MA165]] at T I 697c18.
173 The parallel is [[MA169]] at T I 701b-703c and has the title “discourse [spoken among] the Kurus on [the
subject of] non-conflict”, . While [[MN139]] takes place in Jeta’s Grove by Sāvatthī, [[MA169]] takes place among the Bhaggās at Kammāsadhamma, a town of the Kurus, T I 701b24: 謂
世尊略說此義 . As the Bhaggā country was to the east of Sāvatthī, whereas the Kuru country was
to its west, [[MA169]] seems to have conflated two locations. The Vyākhyāyukti in Lee 2001: 102,15 refers to the present discourse as nyon mongs pa med pa’i mdo, which Skilling 2000b: 340 indicates to
correspond to Ara�a-sūtra, thereby agreeing with [[MN139]] on taking the main topic of the discourse as
its title. For discourse quotations in Abhidh-k-� and in the Vyākhyāyukti cf. below note 187.
174 The fragment is SHT II 163a (p. 15), which has preserved part of the examination of different language
usages found in [[MN139]] at MN III 234,31.

not beneficial. [176] The Majjhima-nikāya discourse notes that the pursuit of sensual pleasures and the practice of self-mortification are both beset by dukkha, vexation, despair,
and fever, and thus are both the wrong path. [177]

MN III 231  The qualification of the pursuit of sensual pleasures and self-mortifications as wrong
paths beset by dukkha is also found in both versions as part of their examination of the
next topic, the need to avoid praising and disparaging in order to properly teach the
Dharma.
At this point, the Madhyama-āgama version also explains the reasons for coming to
the conclusion that the pursuit of sensual pleasures and the pursuit of self-mortification
are both wrong paths and beset by dukkha. According to its explanation, both are seen
to be the wrong path and beset by dukkha once one realizes that sensual pleasures are
impermanent, unsatisfactory, and bound to change, [178] and once one sees how recluses
and Brahmins inflict pain on themselves even though they would (by nature) be averse
to pain. [179]

MN III 232  The Ara�avibha�ga-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel take up the eradication
of the fetter to existence as a third instance in regard to which one should avoid praising and disparaging. Both versions explain that, as long as this fetter is not eradicated,
existence has not been transcended. [180]
The Madhyama-āgama discourse comes out with a fourth instance for avoiding praising and disparaging. This fourth instance takes up the search for happiness within, [181]
pointing out that one should not proclaim that those, who do not search for happiness
within, are all on the wrong path and beset by dukkha, as in this way one would be
blaming others.
By taking up the topic of searching for happiness within, the Madhyama-āgama parallel offers a lead over to the subsequent topic in both versions, which is indeed the pursuit of happiness within. Before, however, taking up this topic, the two versions conclude their examination of praising and disparaging by explaining how to properly
teach the Dharma.

of the eradicated fetter to existence, bhavasa�yojana� pahīna�, a reading found throughout in the

According to the Majjhima-nikāya version’s presentation, to teach the Dharma instead of praising and disparaging takes place when a statement is not formulated by
stating that “all those” who engage in the pursuit of sensual pleasures, etc., are on the
wrong path. Instead, to properly teach the Dharma is to simply speak of the pursuit as
such. [182] The Madhyama-āgama version makes the same point.
In relation to the pursuit of happiness within, the Ara�avibha�ga-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel recommend in similar terms that the ignoble pleasure of the senses
should be avoided and the inner happiness of the jhānas should be developed. [183]
The two versions continue by examining what types of speech should better not be
employed. They agree that:

 - untrue and unbeneficial words should under all circumstances be avoided,

 - true but unbeneficial worlds are also better not spoken,

 - true and beneficial words can be spoken at the right time. [184]
Yet another perspective on speech is that, according to both versions, hurried speech
should be avoided. The reason is that speaking hastily will tire body and mind, moreover,
what is said in such a manner will be unclear and therefore difficult to understand. [185]
The Ara�avibha�ga-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel next take up dogmatic
insistence on local dialects. [186] Parts of this topic have also been preserved in the San

182 E.g., in relation to the pursuit of sensual pleasures, [[MN139]] at MN III 232,17+13 recommends to teach
the Dharma by making a statement in this manner: “this pursuit ... is the wrong path”, anuyogo ... micchāpa�ipadā ti, instead of proclaiming that “those who engage in this pursuit ... they all are ... on the
wrong path”, ye ... anuyutta ... sabbe te ... micchāpa�ipannā ti.
183 [[MN139]] at MN III 233,22 qualifies sensual happiness not only as worldly and ignoble, but also as mī�hasukha, literally “dung [type of] happiness” (for the term cf. also the dung beetle in [[SN17.5]] at SN II
228,24, or the manure mountain in [[AN5.196]] at AN III 241,20). Chalmers 1927: 288 renders mī�hasukha
as “foul ... ease”, Horner 1959: 281 has: “vile happiness”, and Ñā�amoli 1995/2005: 1083 as “filthy
pleasure”, whereas Neumann 1896/1995: 1020 opts for a literal translation as “kotiges Wohl”; cf. also
Hare 1961: 242, who renders another occurrence of the same expression as “dung-like ease”, as well as
the similar rendering as “dung-like happiness” in Masefield 1986: 7). [[MA169]] at T I 702c4 also lists the
worldly and ignoble happiness, followed by explaining that this type of happiness is “rooted in disease
and in [being like] a carbuncle”,, but does not have a counterpart to mī�hasukha.
184 [[MN139]] at MN III 234,4 mentions not speaking secret words, rahovāda� na bhāseyya (which according to Ps V 30,17 refers to malicious speech), nor speaking roughly when face to face, sammukhā na
khī�a� bhane ti (S [e] -MN III 428,16: nātikhīna�), and then continues to examine these two alternatives
from the perspective of the three types of speech (i.e. untrue and unbeneficial, true and unbeneficial,
true and beneficial). [[MA169]] at T I 702c17 instead instructs: “do not speak in an insinuating [manner]
and also do not extol [someone] to [his] face”,, (with as a
and variant reading instead of, a reading adopted in the Madhyama-āgama edition vol.
3 p. 1517). The first part of this instruction could be similar to [[MN139]] in the sense of envisaging some
indirect form of communication, while the second part is exactly the opposite of [[MN139]] which refers
to rough speech when being in front of someone else, not praise. [[MA169]] then takes up the first case of 病本, 癰本
, from the same three perspectives, but does not apply this threefold treatment to the other case
of “extolling [someone] to [his] face”.
185 [[MN139]] at MN III 234,20 contrasts “unhurriedly”, ataramāna, with “hurriedly”, taramāna, [[MA169]] at T I
702c26: “speak regularly and restrained, do not speak irregularly and unrestrained”, .

The parallel versions agree in listing various terms for a bowl to illustrate variations
between different local dialects in ancient India. The Sanskrit fragment and the discourse quote in the commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya not only list various
words for a “bowl”, but also illustrates language variations with the example of different terms employed to refer to a “person”. [188]

MN III 235 The Ara�avibha�ga-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel recapitulate their exposition by taking up the topics covered so far from the perspective of whether such conduct leads to conflict or to absence of conflict. [189] The two versions conclude with the
Buddha encouraging the monks to undertake what leads to the absence of conflict,
praising Subhūti as exemplary in this respect. [190]

up the present passage as an example for dialect variations and comments that the Buddha “in the course
of his preaching tours ... varied his language to suit his audience ... it can be assumed, therefore, that
from the beginning the teachings of the Buddha ... were not restricted to a single dialect or language”;

423r6 in Melzer 2006: 284, in the Dharmaskandha, fragment 4737 folio 19v10 to 20r1 in Dietz 1984:

Gnoli 1977: 157,24. A series of different terms used to refer to a being are also listed in the Jain Viyāhapa��atti 2.14 in Lalwani 1973b: 149,22.
189 The recapitulations in each of the two versions do not seem to take into account all the subjects mentioned earlier, since [[MN139]] does not mention the topic of the fetter to existence, although both versions covered this topic earlier and [[MA169]] at T I 703a26 does include it in its recapitulation. [[MA169]]
in turn does not mention the topic of praising and blaming, although both versions took up this topic
earlier and [[MN139]] at MN III 236,6 includes it in its recapitulation.
190 [[MA169]] at T I 703c10 adds to this a verse in praise of Subhūti, according to which he practised true
emptiness, . References to Subhūti’s qualities recur in other discourses, although with some
differences in the qualities that are highlighted. The list of outstanding disciples in [[AN1.75]] at AN I
24,8 takes up Subhūti’s excellence in dwelling free from conflict, to which it adds his worthiness in receiving gifts; cf. also Maithrimurthi 2004: 205. [[UD6.7]] at [[UD71.10]] records the Buddha praising Subhūti
for his meditative abilities, in particular for his removal of thoughts and his ability to attain the perception of the immaterial. According to Th 1, in what tradition reckons to be his own verse, Subhūti highlights his liberated and concentrated state of mind. The listing of outstanding disciples in [[EA4.8]] at T II
558b15 extols Subhūti for his continuous delight in emptiness concentration and his ability to discriminate properly the meaning of emptiness,, followed by praising him for his resolution on being established in the peace of emptiness and his sublime and virtuous actions,
. Subhūti’s understanding of emptiness comes up for praise again in [[EA22.3]] at T II 663a 行真實空 4

[[MN140]] Dhātuvibha�ga-sutta

The Dhātuvibha�ga-sutta, the “discourse on an analysis of elements”, offers a detailed instruction on the elements. This discourse has a parallel in the Madhyama-āgama and in an individual translation, [191] in addition to which another parallel can be found
in a discourse quotation in Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya,
extant in Tibetan. [192]
The Dhātuvibha�ga-sutta, the Madhyama-āgama version, and the discourse quotation in Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya begin by relating
that the Buddha had come to the place of a potter in Rājagaha and asked permission to
stay overnight.
The individual translation precedes the same event with a narration that gives some
background to Pukkusāti, the person whom the Buddha met at the potter’s place, a
narration found also in the Pāli commentary and in a Chinese Dharmapada Avadāna
collection. [193] With some variations, the individual translation, the Pāli commentary, and


and in [[EA46.3]] at T II 795c24. Subhūti’s being outstanding for his worthiness to receive gifts recurs in
the *Karmavibha�gopadeśa in Lévi 1932a: 161,17, while his excellence in living without conflict is
mentioned in the Avadānaśataka in Speyer 1909/1970: 131,6 or in Vaidya 1958a: 232,23, in the Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā, cf. the Sanskrit version in Conze 1957: 35,8 and its Chinese translations in T
220 at T VII 981b17, T 235 at T VIII 749c10, T 236a at T VIII 753c18, T 237 at T VIII 763a16 (= T
236b at T VIII 758b8), T 238 at T VIII 768a14, and T 239 at T VIII 772c23, and in the A��asāhasrikā
Prajñāpāramitā, cf. the Sanskrit version in Mitra 1888: 20,8 and its Chinese translation in T 227 at T
VIII 538b9; cf. also T 223 at T VIII 234a12 and T VIII 238b21.
191 The parallels are [[MA162]] at T I 690a-692b, entitled “discourse on an analysis of the six elements”,
(which thereby has the same title as [[MA163]] the parallel to the Sa�āyatanavibha�ga-sutta, [[MN137]]), and T 511 at T XIV 779a-781a, entitled “discourse spoken by the Buddha on the five wishes
of King Bimbisāra”, . According to the information given in the Taishō edition, T
511 was translated by Zhī Qīan ( ). [[MA162]] and T 511 agree with [[MN140]] on locating the discourse
at Rājagaha. Parts of [[MA162]] have been studied by Minh Chau 1964/1991: 70 and 117-120. Skilling
1997a: 34 notes a reference to the present discourse in the Āgamak�udraka-vyākhyāna as khams drug gi
rnam par dbye ba, which would correspond to �addhātuvibha�ga. The Sa�gītiparyāya, T 1536 at T T
XXVI 394a24, refers to the present discourse as the “discourse on an analysis of the six elements”,
.

分別六界經 Ejima 1989: 38,1 or Pradhan 1967: 24,10, paralleling [[MN140]] at MN III 239,10, with its Chinese counterparts in T 1558 at T XXIX 8c20 and T 1559 at T XXIX 168c15 (for discourse quotation parallels in
Abhidh-k to the listing of hair (etc.) as manifestations of the earth element, mentioned in [[MN140]] at 佛說蓱沙王五願經
MN III 240,22, cf. above p. 194 note 259). Abhidh-k-� agrees with [[MN140]] on the location and, as part 支謙
of the Buddha’s announcement of what he will teach, at D (4094) mngon pa, ju 35b5 or Q (5595) tu

193 Ps V 33,21 and T 211 at T IV 580c19, translated in Willemen 1999: 41-42. T 511 at T XIV 779a10 differs from these two in as much as it begins by describing five wishes made by King Bimbisāra (these

the Chinese Dharmapada Avadāna collection report that Pukkusāti had been a king and
friend of King Bimbisāra, who had informed Pukkusāti of the appearance of the Buddha
and his teaching. This had inspired Pukkusāti so much that he decided to go forth on
his own, with the intention of approaching the Buddha to become his disciple.

MN III 238  The Dhātuvibha�ga-sutta and its parallels agree that Pukkusāti, who was already residing at the potter’s place, readily agreed to share the place with the Buddha, whom he
did not recognize. The four versions describe in similar terms that the two spent most
of the night in meditation. After this a conversation began, during which the Buddha
found out that Pukkusāti had gone forth on his account. Without revealing his identity,
the Buddha thereon decided to give Pukkusāti a teaching.

MN III 239  This teaching in all versions begins by mentioning:

       - the six elements, [194]

       - the six types of contact,

       - the eighteen types of mental exploration that are based on these contacts. [195]
The four versions continue by briefly presenting four maxims, [196] after which they
turn to a more detailed analysis of the elements mentioned earlier. [197]


five wishes are also mentioned in Vin I 37,17). The relation of these five wishes to the remainder of the
discourse is tenuous, even though they account for the title of T 511. Regarding the similar narrations
found in the Pāli commentary and T 511, Nattier 2008: 165 note 6 observes that this “demonstrates that
material classified as a commentary in one tradition (e.g., that presented by Buddhaghosa) could be incorporated into a sūtra itself in another textual lineage”. A to some degree similar narration can also be
found in the first part of the Rudrāya�āvadāna of the Divyāvadāna in Cowell 1886: 544,22 or in Vaidya 1999: 465,1.
194 A minor difference in the exposition of the six elements is that, whereas [[MN140]] at MN III 239,19 and
[[MA162]] at T I 690b28 have as the sixth element consciousness, viññā�a/, T 511 at T XIV 780a12
speaks instead of the “mind”,, a character that usually corresponds to citta. When taking up the sixth
sense, to which [[MN140]] at MN III 239,25 refers as manas and [[MA162]] at T I 690c2 similarly as, T
511 at T XIV 780b19 uses the same .
195 A discourse quotation from an exposition of the six elements and contacts can be found in the *Mahāvibhā�ā, T 1545 at T XXVII 381c3; for a discussion of the eighteen types of mental explorations cf. the
same work, T 1545 at T XXVII 716b6. A teaching that similarly begins with the six elements, the six
types of contact, and the eighteen types of mental exploration occurs also in the Śik�āsamuccaya in
Bendall 1902/1970: 244,11. A discourse quotation paralleling the reference to the eighteen mental explorations in [[MN140]] at MN III 239,28 (or in [[MN137]] at MN III 216,29) can be found in Abhidh-k 3:32
in Pradhan 1967: 146,22, with its Chinese counterparts in T 1558 at T XXIX 53b 識 29 and T 1559 at T
XXIX 210b18; cf. also D (4094) 心 mngon pa, ju 165b6 or Q (5595) tu 191b1. A discourse quotation paralleling the subsequent mental explorations of pleasure in [[MN140]] at MN III 239,30 (or in [[MN137]] at 意
MN III 216,31) can be found in Abhidh-k 心 3:32 in Pradhan 1967: 147,10, with its Chinese counterparts in
T 1558 at T XXIX 53c16 and T 1559 at T XXIX 210c4.
196 [[MN140]] at MN III 240,9 refers to these as four “resolutions”, adhi��hāna, [[MA162]] at T I 690c9 as “four
spheres of establishment”,, and D (4094) mngon pa, ju 35b7 or Q (5595) tu 39a3 as “four resolutions”, byin gyis brlabs (D: gyi rlabs) bzhi pa, while T 511 varies, cf. T XIV 780b27: “four solid phenomena”,, but then T XIV 780b28: “four solid intentions”, . Horner 1959: 286 note 1
draws attention to [[AN3.61]] at AN I 175,28, where the six elements, the six types of contact, and the
eighteen types of mental exploration recur, with the difference that they are followed by the four noble

Chapter 14 Vibha�ga-vagga                                    -  799


The Dhātuvibha�ga-sutta and its parallels list various manifestations of the five
physical elements, found within oneself. [198] They conclude that any instance of these
elements, whether found inside or outside of oneself, should be contemplated as notself in order to develop detachment.
In regard to the sixth element of consciousness, the Dhātuvibha�ga-sutta and its parallels highlight in similar ways that pleasant, unpleasant and neutral experiences depend on contact, hence once contact ceases, these experiences will also cease. [199] The
Dhātuvibha�ga-sutta illustrates the dependence of the three types of experience on the
corresponding type of contact with the image of sticks employed to make a fire, a comparison found also in the parallel versions. [200]
The Dhātuvibha�ga-sutta and its parallels continue by describing a level of equanimity that can be directed to attaining the immaterial spheres, which they compare to a


truths. The four adhi��hānas can also be found in [[DN33]] at DN III 229,18 and in its Chinese and Sanskrit parallels, [[DA9]] at T I 51a17 (where they are introduced as “spheres”, ) and fragment [[SN510]]R1 in
Stache-Rosen 1968: 24.
197 Unlike the other versions, T 511 at T XIV 780a13 has this detailed examination of the elements already
earlier, when listing the six elements together with the six types of contact and the eighteen mental explorations.
198 Abhidh-k-� also offers a definition of the external element, cf. D (4094) mngon pa, ju 37a3 or Q (5595)
tu 40a8 for the case of earth. A comparable exposition in the Śrāvakabhūmi also gives examples for the
manifestation of the external earth element, cf. Shukla 1973: 212,2 or ŚSG 2007: 72,11 and T 1579 at T
XXX 430a22. A noteworthy variation in the listings of the internal elements is that [[MA162]] at T I 690c22,
T 511 at T XIV 780a19, and D (4094) mngon pa, ju 37a7 or Q (5595) tu 40b5 mention the brain, including it under manifestations of the water element; cf. also Minh Chau 1964/1991: 117. According to 處
Vism 240,24, the brain should be understood to be implicitly included under bone marrow, which [[MN140]] at MN III 240,24 lists under the earth element, so that on this explanation the brain would be an instance of the earth element. The brain is included under the water element also in [[MA30]] at T I 465a27;
cf. also the Śrāvakabhūmi, Shukla 1973: 213,8 or ŚSG 2007: 74,4 and T 1579 at T XXX 430a26. [[EA28.4]]
at T II 652a19, however, reckons the brain as part of the earth element.
199 While [[MN140]] at MN III 242,11 applies this treatment to experiences that are sukha, dukkha, or adukkhamasukha, [[MA162]] at T I 691b4 lists and then examines, thereby adding mental pleasure and mental displeasure, corresponding to somanassa and domanassa, to the three
feeling tones taken into account in [[MN140]] a difference already noted by Lin Li-Kouang 1949: 260261 note 8. The same fivefold presentation recurs in D (4094) mngon pa, ju 38b7 or Q (5595) tu 42a7,
which covers bde ba, sdug bsngal, yid bde ba, yid mi bde ba and btang snyoms. At a later point, however, in what appears to be a summary of the present exposition, [[MA162]] at T I 691c5 speaks only of
“these three feelings”, . This suggests the fivefold presentation to be a later expansion of what
originally was only a treatment of the three types of feeling found also in [[MN140]] The corresponding
part in Abhidh-k-�, however, speaks of “four feelings”, D (4094) mngon pa, ju 39b1 or Q (5595) tu 42b8:
tshor ba bzhi po. T 511 at T XIV 780b29 refers only to the three feelings, although it differs from the
other version by not examining their dependence on contact. This part of T 511 is rather cryptic and 樂識, 苦識, 喜識, 憂識, 捨識
may have suffered from textual loss.
200 [[MN140]] at MN III 242,32, [[MA162]] at T I 691b27, T 511 at T XIV 780c3, and D (4094) mngon pa, ju
39a6 or Q (5595) tu 42b6. The same simile as an illustration of the dependent nature of the three types
of feeling on contact recurs in [[SN36.10]] at SN IV 215,21, but is absent from the parallel version [[SA466]] at T II 119a11.

goldsmith who refines gold until it is pure and wieldy in order to make ornaments and
jewellery. [201]

MN III 244  In agreement with its parallels, the Dhātuvibha�ga-sutta indicates that, after realizing
the true nature of the immaterial attainments, the meditating monk goes beyond
them. [202]
The Dhātuvibha�ga-sutta and its parallels agree that someone who has reached this
level of detachment and experiences feelings limited by the body or by life will simply
reflect that after death all that is felt will come to an end, [203] similar to an oil lamp that
will be extinguished once the wick and the oil are used up. [204]

MN III 245  The three versions continue by taking up four maxims, [205] according to which:

       - to destroy all dukkha is to reach the peak of wisdom, [206]

       - to realize liberation is to attain the supreme truth, [207]

       - to abandon all attachments is to accomplish supreme relinquishment,

       - to overcome all defilements is to find supreme peace. [208]

MN III 246  The parallel versions next turn to various modes of mental speculation. [209] According
to the Pāli and Tibetan account, a sage, who is beyond such conceivings, will not be born,
grow old, or pass away. [210] The Chinese version does not speak of not being born, grow

201 [[MN140]] at MN III 243,12, [[MA162]] at T I 691c10, and D (4094) mngon pa, ju 39b4 or Q (5595) tu
43a4. The simile is also found in T 511 at T XIV 780c5.
202 [[MN140]] at MN III 244,19, [[MA162]] at T I 692a2, T 511 at T XIV 780c11, and D (4094) mngon pa, ju
40a5 or Q (5595) tu 43b5.
203 [[MN140]] at MN III 244,34, [[MA162]] at T I 692a3, and D (4094) mngon pa, ju 40a6 or Q (5595) tu 43b6.
This part does not have a counterpart in T 511. [[MN140]] precedes this treatment by referring to the attainment of full liberation, followed by describing the arahant’s detached attitude towards the three types
of feeling. Such a description is not found in [[MA162]] or in Abhidh-k-�.
204 After the examination of feelings, illustrated by the simile of the lamp, Abhidh-k-� refers to the attainment of full liberation, D (4094) mngon pa, ju 40b3 or Q (5595) tu 44a3, which it has again after the
exposition on conceivings, D (4094) mngon pa, ju 41b5 or Q (5595) tu 45a6.
205 A counterpart to the present passage can be found in the Sa�gītiparyāya, T 1536 at T XXVI 394a25 to
T XXVI 394b15.
206 While [[MN140]] at MN III 245,15 presents the knowledge of the destruction of all dukkha, sabbadukkhakkhaye ñā�a, as the peak of wisdom, [[MA162]] at T I 692a12 and D (4094) mngon pa, ju 40b4 or Q
(5595) tu 44a5 apply the same to having reached the destruction of the influxes, /zag pa zad pa.
207 While [[MN140]] at MN III 245,17 qualifies Nirvā�a as the supreme truth, ta� sacca� ya� amosadhamma� nibbāna�, [[MA162]] at T I 692a13 and D (4094) mngon pa, ju 40b5 or Q (5595) tu 44a5 present liberation, /rnam par grol ba, as the supreme truth.
208 The overcoming of lust, anger, and delusion is also mentioned in T 511 at T XIV 780c18.
209 The terminology employed in this context differs considerably. [[MN140]] at MN III 246,13 speaks of
these speculations as “conceivings”, maññita, [[MA162]] at T I 692a22 presents them as forms of “elevating oneself”,, D (4094) mngon pa, ju 41a3 or Q (5595) tu 44b4 qualifies these as manifestations of
“instability”, mi brtan pa, followed by later on indicating that each of these occasions the arising of
craving, sred par ’gyur ba. The corresponding section in T 511 at T XIV 780c23 similarly refers to “instability” or “motion”, . An occurrence of maññati in [[MN1]] at MN I 4,27 has as its counterpart in 漏盡
[[MA106]] at T I 596b21 the term “to speculate”, .
210 [[MN140]] at MN III 246,21 explains that in the case of the sage “there is nothing in him by which he

ing old, or dying, but instead describes that the mental peace accomplished in this way
leads to transcending dislikes, sadness, vexation, and fear, and to attaining Nirvā�a. [211]
The Chinese discourse continues with the standard description of full liberation, [212] which
in the Pāli version already occurred at an earlier point, while the Tibetan version has
the same twice, earlier and at the present junction (see table 14.4).

The Madhyama-āgama version and the discourse quotation in Śamathadeva’s commentary indicate that Pukkusāti attained stream-entry while listening to this exposition. [214] All versions report that Pukkusāti, on realizing that he had met his teacher,
apologized for not having recognized the Buddha and not having treated him with the
proper respect. [215]

Karunadasa 1991: 62 explains that, although “decay and death as physical facts cannot be overcome with the attainment of Nibbāna”, yet, “since the liberated saint (arahant) does not identify himself with the five khandhas ... he
has won a psychological victory over ... decay and death. The experience of decay and death is there only
when one identifies oneself with what is subject to decay and death”; cf. also Tilakaratne 2008: 100.

tu 45b4 the expression tshe dang ldan pa. While T 511 does not report him using any mode of address,
according to [[MA162]] at T I 690a28 Pukkusāti had earlier used the address “dear sir”,, which he then
confessed at [[MA162]] at T I 692b13. Elsewhere, however, [[MA162]] at T I 690b 不復有可說憎者, 若不憎則不憂, 不憂則不愁, 7+13 records Pukkusāti 不愁則不勞, 不

MN III 247  While the Madhyama-āgama version ends at this point, the other versions continue by
narrating that Pukkusāti was killed by a cow. The monks reported this accident to the
Buddha, who according to the Pāli version and the individual translation told them that
Pukkusāti had become a non-returner, [216] whereas according to the Tibetan version
Pukkusāti passed away as an arahant. [217]
A discourse in the Sa�yutta-nikāya and its parallel in the Sa�yukta-āgama concord
with the Pāli version and the individual translation by reporting that Pukkusāti had
been reborn in a realm where non-returners take birth. [218]


[[MN141]] Saccavibha�ga-sutta

The Saccavibha�ga-sutta, the “discourse on an analysis of the truths”, records an exposition of the four noble truths delivered by Sāriputta. This discourse has a parallel in
the Madhyama-āgama, a parallel in the Ekottarika-āgama, and a parallel in an individual translation. [219]

MN III 248  The Saccavibha�ga-sutta begins with the Buddha’s declaration that at the Deer Park
near Vārā�asī he had set in motion the wheel of Dharma by teaching the four noble
truths. [220] The Madhyama-āgama version and the individual translation instead proclaim


using the address, the usual counterpart to āvuso in Madhyama-āgama discourses. Another noteworthy point is that [[MN140]] MN III 247,4, [[MA162]] at T I 692b14, and D (4094) mngon pa, ju 42a4 or
Q (5595) tu 45b5 agree that the Buddha addressed Pukkusāti as bhikkhu/ /dge slong, even though at
this point he had not yet received full ordination (T 511 at T XIV 781a3 does not record any form of
address). A similar instance of such a more informal use of bhikkhu can be found in [[MN26]] at MN I
170,23 and [[MN36]] at MN I 247,14, where the five companions of the bodhisattva are referred to as the
“five bhikkhus”.
216 [[MN140]] at MN III 247,31 and T 511 at T XIV 781a12, the same is also reported in T 211 at T IV 581a24,
translated in Willemen 1999: 43.
217 D (4094) mngon pa, ju 43a2 or Q (5595) tu 46b3.
218 [[SN1.50]] at SN I 35, 賢者 10 (or [[SN2]] 50 at [[SN2]] I 75,14) and [[SA595]] at T II 159b14.
219 The parallels are [[MA31]] at T I 467a-469c, [[EA27.1]] at T II 643a-c, and T 32 at T I 814b-816c. According to the information given in the Taishō edition, T 32 was translated by Ān Sh 比丘 ìgāo ( ), an attribution that according to Zacchetti 2010a: 253 is probably correct. [[MA31]] has the title “discourse on an
analysis of the noble truths”, . T 32 has the title “discourse spoken by the Buddha on the
four truths”, . The qualification “spoken by the Buddha”,, occurs frequently in the
title of individual translations (cf. above p. 23 note 4). In the present case, appears to have been applied to T 32 somewhat automatically, without proper consideration of its contents, as the main part of
the discourse is not “spoken by the Buddha”, but rather by Sāriputta. While [[MN141]] is located in the
Deer Park by Vārā�asī, the three parallel versions take place in Jeta’s Grove by Sāvatthī. [[MA31]] has
been studied by Minh Chau 1964/1991: 23-24, 56, 59, 96-98, and 122-126. A translation of [[EA27.1]]
can be found in Anālayo 2006e. Harrison 1997: 277 lists T 32 among translations by Ān Shìgāo that
may stem from an Ekottarika-āgama collection. 安世高
220 According to [[SA389]] at T II 105a25 (translated in Anālayo 2012f) and [[SA2]] 254 at T II 462c10, the four
aspects of this basic scheme of the four noble truths correspond to four qualities of a doctor, who needs 分別聖諦經
to be able to identify a disease, to diagnose its cause, to know the appropriate remedy, and to administer 佛說四諦經 佛說
the actual cure until the disease is over; cf. also the Saundaranandakāvya 佛說 16:41 in Johnston 1928:


Chapter 14 Vibha�ga-vagga                                    -  803


that past, present, and future Tathāgatas teach these four noble truths, [221] while the Ekottarika-āgama account simply declares that the Buddha always taught and explained the
four truths. [222]
Notably, the Ekottarika-āgama version speaks only of “four truths”, without employing the qualification “noble”. [223] The same is the case in other discourses in this collection, [224] in discourses from the partially preserved Sa�yukta-āgama, [225] as well as in several Vinayas. [226] This suggests the possibility that this qualification may be a later addition to formulations of the four noble truths. [227]
The Saccavibha�ga-sutta and its Chinese parallels agree in reporting that the Buddha
told the assembled monks that Sāriputta was able to give a full exposition of the four
noble truths. [228] The Buddha further explained that, while Sāriputta led disciples to the


1928: 116,17, and the discussion in Halbfass 1991/1992: 246, Kern 1896: 46-47, Wezler 1984: 319320, and Zysk 1991: 38.

taking into account verses, where the absence of the qualification ‘noble’ could be due to the need to fit
the syllable count). The same is also absent from T 32.
225 [[SA2]] 81 at T II 402a23, [[SA2]] 92 at T II 405b15, [[SA2]] 152 at T II 431b21, and [[SA2]] 184 at T II 439c13 refer
to the “four truths” (not taking into account verses). SĀ [2] 322 at T II 481c8 uses the expression “four
truths”, but then at T II 481c10 refers to the “four noble truths”. SĀ [2] 198 at T II 445b9 qualifies only
the first truth as a “noble truth”, while the other three are simply “truths”. A similar pattern occurs in
SĀ [2] 340, which at T II 487b20 qualifies the first truth as a “noble truth”, and then turns to the remaining three without bringing in any truth qualification at all.
226 The Dharmaguptaka Vinaya speaks only of the “four truths” in T 1428 at T XXII 606a19 and at T XXII
910a4, but then uses the qualification “noble” in its version of the Buddha’s first discourse at T XXII
788a14. The Mahīśāsaka Vinaya speaks of the “four truths” in T 1421 at T XXII 105b12, but then uses
the qualification “noble”’ in its version of the first discourse at T XXII 104b28. The Sarvāstivāda Vinaya refers to the “four truths” in T 1435 at T XXIII 122b23, at T XXIII 122c1+9, at T XXIII 131c25, at T
XXIII 193a11, at T XXIII 244b12, and at T XXIII 368b16, but then uses the qualification “noble” in its
version of the first discourse at T XXIII 448b19.
227 For arguments in support of this suggestion cf. Norman 1982/1984; cf. also id. 1990/1993b and Weller
1940.
228 While in [[MN141]] at MN III 248,23 the Buddha highlighted the wisdom of Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna and encouraged the monks to frequent these two, according to [[MA31]] at T I 467b10 and T 32 at T
I 814b21 he only praised Sāriputta, making use of a string of epithets similar to those used in [[MN111]]
at MN III 25,5 to describe Sāriputta’s wisdom. In regard to the difference between praises given to Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna or only to Sāriputta, it is perhaps noteworthy that [[MN141]] at MN III 248,22
qualifies Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna as “helpful” to their fellow monks, anuggāhaka, a qualification
that recurs in relation to Sāriputta only in [[SN22.2]] at SN III 5,32 and in [[SN47.13]] at SN V 162,28. According to [[EA27.1]] at T II 643b8, the Buddha simply told the monks to associate with Sāriputta and
Mahāmoggallāna and hold them in high regard.

attainment of stream-entry, Mahāmoggallāna led them further on to full awakening, [229]
which the Buddha compared to the roles performed by a mother (who nourishes the
foetus in her womb and gives birth) and the role of a foster mother (who then raises the
child). [230]

MN III 249  According to all versions, the Buddha retired to his dwelling, whereon Sāriputta gave
a more detailed exposition of the topic broached by the Buddha.
When defining dukkha, according to the Majjhima-nikāya and Ekottarika-āgama accounts Sāriputta mentioned sorrow and dejection, aspects of dukkha not covered in the
Madhyama-āgama discourse or in the individual translation. [231] The three Chinese versions agree in mentioning disease, association with what is disliked, and dissociation
from what is liked, [232] aspects of dukkha not explicitly taken into account in the Saccavibha�ga-sutta, although the same can be found in the Pāli version of what according
to tradition was the first discourse delivered by the Buddha, the Dhammacakkapavattana-sutta. [233]
The Saccavibha�ga-sutta, the Madhyama-āgama version, and the individual translation continue by explaining each of the terms mentioned in their definition of dukkha. [234]
While the Majjhima-nikāya version only defines the term birth, the Madhyama-āgama
version and the individual translation also explain why birth is dukkha, highlighting that


229 According to [[MN141]] at MN III 248,25, Sāriputta leads others to the fruit of stream-entry, while Mahāmoggallāna leads them to the highest. [[MA31]] at T I 467b17 reports that Sāriputta guides others to the
attainment of right view, while Mahāmoggallāna leads them higher, to the destruction of the influxes.
[[EA27.1]] at T II 643b11 describes Sāriputta teaching so that others reach insight into the four truths,
while Mahāmoggallāna leads them to the destruction of the influxes. T 32 at T I 814b26 indicates that
Sāriputta “can teach [how to] follow the path”,, while Mahāmoggallāna “can teach the completion of the path”, .
230 [[MN141]] at MN III 248,23, [[MA31]] at T I 467b19, and T 32 at T I 814b28. According to [[EA27.1]] at T II
643b10, the Buddha spoke of Sāriputta as a mother and father to living beings,, which may
be a transmission or translation error of a comparison similar to the one found in the other versions.
231 [[MN141]] at MN III 249,10 lists: “sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and despair”, sokaparidevadukkhadomanassupāyāsā, while [[EA27.1]] at T II 643b18 lists: “dejection, sorrow, and vexation”, .
232 [[MA31]] at T I 467b29, [[EA27.1]] at T II 643b18, and T 32 at T I 814c7. Disease, association with what is
not liked, and dissociation from what is liked are also mentioned in the definition of dukkha in the parallels to [[MN9]] cf. [[MA29]] at T I 462a27, [[SA344]] at T II 95a2, and folio 17 V12 in Tripā�hī 1962: 52. In
this case, E [e] -MN I 48,32 and C [e] -MN I 114,20 mention disease, while B 能令隨道 [e] -MN I 59,27 and S [e] -MN I 88,22
mention association with what is not liked and dissociation from what is liked, cf. also above p. 69. 能令竟道
Disease, sorrow and pain, etc., and association with what is not liked, together with dissociation from
what is liked, occur in the definitions of dukkha given in the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya, 眾生之父母 T 1421 at T XXII 104c1.
Disease and association with what is not liked, together with dissociation from what is liked, are also
found in the corresponding definition in the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, T 1428 at T XXII 788a16, and in
the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, T 1450 at T XXIV 128b4. 憂, 悲, 惱
233 [[SN56.11]] at SN V 421,19 and Vin I 10,26. The Ee edition of [[DN22]] at DN II 305,2 also mentions disease, while B [e] -DN II 243,17, C [e] -DN II 478, and S [e] -DN II 341,1 mention association with what is not
liked and dissociation from what is liked; for a survey of the parallel versions cf. Chung 2006.

on being born one experiences bodily and mental pain, bodily heat and mental fever,
whereby one is afflicted and troubled. [235]
In relation to disease, a manifestation of dukkha not covered in the Saccavibha�gasutta, the Madhyama-āgama version and the individual translation list various afflictions and diseases. [236] According to the same two versions, association with what is disliked and dissociation from what is liked refers to disagreeable or agreeable experiences that take place by way of the six senses or by way of the six elements (i.e., the
four material elements, space, and consciousness). [237]
The Madhyama-āgama version and the individual translation agree with the Saccavibha�ga-sutta that not obtaining what is wished for stands for the impossibility to be free
from birth, old age, and death, etc., by mere wishing. These two Chinese versions additionally mention the wish to change pain into pleasure, as well as the wish for pleasure to last forever, these being another two instances where it is not possible to achieve
what one would wish. [238]
While the Majjhima-nikāya and the Madhyama-āgama discourses round up their examination of dukkha by simply listing the five aggregates [affected by] clinging, [239] the
individual translation additionally points out that the five aggregates [affected by] clinging are dukkha because they are impermanent and subject to disease, old age, etc. [240]
The Madhyama-āgama version and the individual translation conclude their exposition


235 [[MA31]] at T I 467c5 and T 32 at T I 814c11, explanations both versions repeat for old age and death.
236 [[MA31]] at T I 467c22 and T 32 at T I 815a2, a listing that brings to mind [[AN10.60]] at AN V 110,1.
237 [[MA31]] at T I 468a14 and T 32 at T I 815a27.
238 [[MA31]] at T I 468b9 and T 32 at T I 815b27 (both deal in the same way with disagreeable and agreeable
thoughts).
239 In relation to the standard reference to the five aggregates [affected by] clinging in formulations of the
first noble truth, Vetter 1998: 384 notes that in some instances a reading can be found that adds pi to
this formulation, so that the statement reads sa�khittena pañc’ upādānakkhandhā pi dukkhā (e.g., Vin I
10,29). He then suggests (p. 386) that sa�khittena may only mean that “this is a short remark that has to
be explained to the neophyte who does not know what the five upādānakkhandhas are and/or why they
are called dukkha”, proposing that the pi indicates the reference to the five aggregates [affected by]
clinging to be another alternative instance of what is dukkha, instead of being a summary of what has
been listed before. Yet, [[SN56.13]] at SN V 425,17 defines the first noble truth by only listing the five
aggregates [affected by] clinging alone, katamañ ca, bhikkhave, dukkham ariyasacca�? pañc’ upādānakkhandhā ti ’ssa vacanīya�. This confirms that sa�khittena in the standard expositions does introduce a summary statement. Moreover, formulations of the first noble truth in the Chinese Āgamas do
not seem to have an equivalent to pi in their listings, in fact in most cases their way of presentation indicates that the translators understood whatever equivalent they found to sa�khittena in their original to
introduce a summary statement, cf., e.g., [[MA13]] at T I 435c28:, [[SA344]] at T II 95a3:
, and [[EA27.1]] at T II 643b19:, a formulation that recurs also in
the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, T 1428 at T XXII 788a17:, and with only a slight difference in the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya, T 1421 at T XXII 104c2: .
240 T 32 at T I 815c11: “their nature is to be impermanent, distressful, afflicted, they are affected by destruction, disease, loss, and old age, they are not stable, they cannot be changed or left behind by mere
faithful wishing, for this reason the five aggregates [affected by clinging] are dukkha”,

by proclaiming that the noble truth of dukkha has been true in past, is true at present,
and will be true in future times. [241]
The Saccavibha�ga-sutta and its Chinese parallels agree in relating the origin of dukkha to craving, although they differ in the extent to which they explain such craving.
The shortest treatment occurs in the Ekottarika-āgama version, which simply declares
that the arising of dukkha is due to the fetter of craving. [242] The Majjhima-nikāya version
offers more details, as it explains that such craving leads to renewed existence and is
accompanied by delight and lust, followed by distinguishing craving into three types:

       - craving for sensual pleasures,

       - craving for existence,

       - craving for non-existence. [243]
The Madhyama-āgama version and the individual translation do not mention these
three types of craving, nor do they speak of renewed existence. Instead, they explain
that the arising of dukkha is due to craving for the six senses or the six elements, a craving that then leads to the arising of attachment. [244] These two Chinese versions illustrate
this predicament by describing various manifestations of craving, such as craving for
relatives or possessions, etc.

MN III 251  The Saccavibha�ga-sutta and its parallels agree that the cessation of dukkha comes
about through the cessation of craving, which the Madhyama-āgama discourse and the
individual translation explain to imply the cessation of craving in relation to the six
senses or the six elements. [245]

241 [[MA31]] at T I 468b23: “in past times this is the noble truth of dukkha, in future times, and in present
times this is the noble truth of dukkha, it is a real truth, not false”,
, a statement applied also to the other three noble truths in [[MA31]] at T I 468c15, T I
469a9, and T I 469b29. T 32 at T I 815c12: “venerables, this is the same truth of dukkha in the past,
venerables, it is also the truth of dukkha in the future, and, venerables, it is the truth of dukkha in the
present, it is not otherwise”,
, a statement applied also to the other three truths in T 32 at T I 815c24, T I 816a9, and T I 816c20.
Minh Chau 1964/1991: 124 suggests this statement to be an expression of the Sarvāstivāda doctrine of
the existence of phenomena in past and future times. Ibid. p. 24 takes the absence of such a statement in
[[MN141]] to be a case of omission and concludes that the occurrence of this passage in [[MA31]] proves that
the Madhyama-āgama stems from the Sarvāstivāda tradition. Against Minh Chau’s suggestion, however, it could be objected that [[SN12.66]] at SN II 110,23 also highlights 過去時是苦聖諦, the applicability 未來, of the 現在時是苦 four noble
聖諦, truths to past and future times, explaining that to know pleasant sense objects to be 真諦, 不虛 dukkha (as well as
impermanent, not-self, etc.) led to freedom from craving in the past, leads to such freedom in the present, and will lead to such freedom in the future. Thus, for the four noble truths to be considered as true
in past and future times is a position held not only in Sarvāstivāda texts. In fact, that certain principles 過世賢者同是苦諦, 未來世賢者亦是苦諦, 現在世賢者亦是苦諦, 是無
有異 and natural laws exist in the past, present, and future seems to have been a position shared by different
Buddhist schools, so that the reciters of [[MN141]] would have had little reason to omit a passage that
makes such a statement.

Chapter 14 Vibha�ga-vagga                                    -  807


The Ekottarika-āgama version presents the path to the cessation of dukkha by simply
listing the eight factors of the noble eightfold path, to which the other three versions
add a more detailed examination of each of these eight factors. [246]
The Saccavibha�ga-sutta, its Madhyama-āgama parallel, and the individual translation define right view to be knowledge of dukkha, its arising, its cessation, and the path
leading to its cessation.
The Madhyama-āgama version and the individual translation indicate that right view
requires analysing, investigating, contemplating, and observing. It is noteworthy how
the examination of the path in these two Chinese versions acquires a somewhat more
abhidharmic flavour in this way, where interest proceeds from what tasks the pathfactors perform to an analysis of what is performing them, i.e., to the mental factors
that are present in each case. [247]
According to the Madhyama-āgama presentation, such analysing and observing can
be directed in various ways, such as contemplating one’s former deeds, or being mindful of mental formations, or seeing the disadvantage inherent in formations, or seeing
the peacefulness of Nirvā�a, or remaining with detachment and mindfulness when attaining a temporary liberation of the mind (i.e. a deeper state of concentration). [248]
When defining right intention, the Majjhima-nikāya version lists three types of right
intention, namely intention of renunciation, of non ill will, and of non cruelty. [249] The
Madhyama-āgama version and the individual translation approach this topic differently,
as instead of listing instances of this path factor, they define right intention in terms of
thoughts and aspirations that are based on the four noble truths’ perspective. [250] The two
Chinese versions adopt this procedure in relation to each of the path factors, in the sense
that each time they reiterate that the main requirement for any path factor is to maintain
the proper perspective of the four noble truths. This way of presentation highlights the
importance of the four noble truths as a basis for developing each factor of the noble
eightfold path. [251]

246 The exposition of the eight path factors found in [[MN141]] at MN III 251,12 recurs in [[DN22]] at DN II
312,1 and in [[SN45.8]] at SN V 8,30.
247 For an examination of another such instance cf. Anālayo 2010i.
248 [[MA31]] at T I 469a16 speaks of analysing, etc., “when he contemplates former deeds, or trains to be
mindful of formations, or sees the disadvantage in formations, or sees Nirvā�a as the supreme peace, or
with detachment and mindfulness contemplates a wholesome liberation of the mind”,
. [[MA31]] applies this description,
together with the four noble truths’ perspective, to each path factor. The present description in [[MA31]]
has its counterpart in T 32 at T I 816a20, which also applies it to each path factor.

250 [[MA31]] at T I 469a20 and T 32 at T I 816a24.
251 This foundational importance of right view for each path factor is explicitly highlighted in [[MN117]] and
its parallels, according to which right view is a precursor to the other path factors, cf. [[MN117]] at MN
III 72,29: sammādi��hi pubba�gamā hoti, [[MA189]] at T I 735c13:, and D (4094) mngon
pa, nyu 44b6 or Q (5595) thu 84a8: yang dag pa’i lta ba sngon du ’gro ba. The same notion also underlies the qualification sammā or samyak, which conveys a sense of several parts that are combined to- 或觀本所作, 或

808   •   A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya


The Majjhima-nikāya version, its Madhyama-āgama parallel, and the individual
translation agree that right speech and right action require abstention from the four unwholesome types of speech and from the three unwholesome types of action. [252]
In regard to right livelihood, the Majjhima-nikāya version and the individual translation speak simply of abstaining from wrong means of livelihood. [253] The Madhyamaāgama discourse offers further explanations, as it specifies that to undertake right livelihood requires developing contentment together with fewness of wishes, as well as abstaining from various improper means of livelihood, so that one seeks for requisites
only by means that are righteous. [254]
The Saccavibha�ga-sutta defines right effort by listing the effort to prevent evil states,
overcome evil states, arouse wholesome states, and maintain wholesome states. The
Madhyama-āgama version and the individual translation do not take up these four in

yañj. That is, the factors of the path become sammā in as much as they are practised in conjunction and
in such a way as to lead to the cessation of dukkha.
252 [[MA31]] at T I 469a28 instructs (after stipulating the need for the four noble truths’ perspective): “herein,
except for the four types of pure verbal conduct, in regard to any other type of evil verbal conduct, he
keeps far away [from them], discards [them], eradicates [them], does not undertake [them], does not
perform [them], does not apply [himself to them], has no connection [with them], this is called right
speech”,,, a way of
presentation [[MA31]] at T I 469b4 then uses in a similar way when defining right action. Instead of contrasting pure speech and action with their evil counterparts, T 32 at T I 816b3+12 speaks of stopping the
four types of verbal transgressions and any other type of evil verbal conduct,,
and enjoins discarding the three types of evil bodily conduct and any other type of evil bodily conduct,
. The reference in [[MA31]] to pure or even “sublime” conduct,, equivalent to sucarita, stands for the wholesome courses of action (kammapatha), cf. [[MA171]] at T I 707c14
(the Madhyama-āgama edition p. 261 note 5 seems to be mistaken in identifying the three types
of pure conduct with the absence of lust, anger, and delusion,
). These wholesome courses of action cover precisely the types of speech and action mentioned in the
definition of right speech and right action in [[MN141]] at MN III 251, 於中, 除口四妙行, 諸餘口惡行, 遠離, 除, 斷, 不行, 不作 19 不合,, namely abstention from false 不會, 是名正語
speech, malicious speech, harsh speech, idle chatter, as well as abstention from killing, taking what is not
given, and sexual misconduct. The same would also correspond to the types of speech and action envisaged in T 32. Thus, in spite of different formulations, the Pāli and Chinese versions agree on the im- 止四口犯, 有餘口惡行
plications of these two path factors. Notably, [[MN141]] at MN III 251,24 speaks of sexual misconduct,
除身三惡行, thereby describing 亦餘身惡行 lay ethics, but then has a bhikkhu as the subject for the last three path factors. 妙行 A similar
definition in [[SN45.8]] at SN V 9,11, which also has a bhikkhu as its subject, instead speaks of abrahmacariya 佛光 .
253 [[MN141]] at MN III 251,27: “having left behind wrong livelihood he makes his living by way of right 十善中之身妙行有三, 即不貪, 不瞋,
livelihood 不癡 ”, micchā ājīva� pahāya sammā ājīvena jīvika� kappeti. T 32 at T I 816b21 instructs to not
get one’s livelihood “by practising various lowly [literally: animal] type of deeds, or through wicked
practices”, .
254 [[MA31]] at T I 469b10 explains that one should “not search for what is unreasonable, not [search] by
having many wishes and being without contentment, not undertake wrong livelihood by doing various
types of crafts, or reciting spells, but only seek for robes ... food ... beds and seats through what is righteous, not through what is unrighteous, this is called right livelihood”,,
(adopting the
and variant reading instead of ).

stances of right effort, but instead explain right effort to stand for maintaining unwavering energy that is based on the four noble truths’ perspective. [255] According to the individual translation, to arouse joy and to maintain mindfulness are also aspects of right
effort. [256]
The Saccavibha�ga-sutta continues by defining right mindfulness with the help of
the four satipa��hānas, while the Madhyama-āgama discourse and the individual translation only mention unwavering mindfulness that is developed based on the four noble
truths’ perspective. The individual translation additionally recommends speaking little
as a way of avoiding loss of mindfulness. [257]
The Majjhima-nikāya version and the Madhyama-āgama account agree in taking
right concentration to stand for jhāna attainment. While the Majjhima-nikāya version
lists the four jhānas, the Madhyama-āgama version only describes that the mind is established in a jhāna without being scattered, without specifying a particular level of
jhāna attainment. [258]

255 Although a full listing of the four types of right effort is not found in [[MA31]] such a full treatment can
be found in [[MA86]] at T I 563a11 and [[MA222]] at T I 806a1. These discourses differ from [[MN141]] in regard to the sequence in which they lists the first two types of right effort, as they begin with the need to
overcome what is evil, after which only they turn to the need to prevent evil. This sequence thus progresses from the gross to the respectively subtler, a progression adopted in all versions for the remaining two right efforts, the arousing of wholesome states and the maintenance of wholesome states. The
Madhyama-āgama sequence recurs in the Sa�yukta-āgama, cf. [[SA178]] at T II 46c25, [[SA622]] at T II
174a10, [[SA647]] at T II 182b29, [[SA877]] at T II 221a24, [[SA878]] at T II 221b6, [[SA879]] at T II 221b19,
and [[SA920]] at T II 233c28. The same sequence can also be found in a treatment of right effort in SĀ [3]
17 at T II 497b3, a partial Sa�yukta-āgama collection that according to Harrison 2002: 3 could be a
translation by Ān Shìgāo ( ), in SHT I 614R1-3 (p. 273), and in the Arthaviniścaya-sūtra in Samtani 1971: 29,3. Discourses in the Dīrgha-āgama and in the Ekottarika-āgama agree with the Pāli sequence, as they also begin with the effort to prevent evil and only then take up the effort to overcome
evil, cf. [[DA9]] at T I 50c14, [[EA26.1]] at T II 635b16, [[EA26.2]] at T II 635b29, [[EA26.3]] at T I 635c11, and
[[EA26.4]] at T I 635c23. From a practical perspective, the sequence found in the Madhyama-āgama and
Sa�yukta-āgama is appealing, since often the most urgent task is to deal with evil that has already arisen,
before being able to turn to the prevention of evil still to arise.
256 T 32 at T I 816c1: . This stipulation brings to mind an exposition of the seven bojjha�gas in [[MN118]] at MN III 85,33 and its parallel [[SA810]] at T II 208b21, according to which the development of the awakening factor of energy leads to the arising of the awakening factor of joy. Another related presentation can 安世高 be found in [[MN117]] at MN III 72,22 and its parallels [[MA189]] at T I 735c24
and D (4094) mngon pa, nyu 44b5 or Q (5595) thu 84a7, according to which right effort requires the cooperation of mindfulness.
257 T 32 at T I 816c9: “speaking little and without being separated from mindfulness”, .
258 [[MA31]] at T I 469b28: “the mind is established, absorption is established, well established, without wavering and without being scattered”, . T 32 at T I 816c15 similarly describes how “because of mental tranquillity [the mind] is unmoving and steadfast, because of having
taken hold of tranquillity, the mind and mindfulness are established in oneness 喜不毀不滅, 念正止 ”,
, a description which in its recapitulation at T I 816c19, however, reads rather differently. According to [[MN52]] at MN I 350,10 (= [[AN11.17]] at AN V 343,18), the destruction of the influxes is possible with each of the four jhānas, i.e., even with the first jhāna, so that the standard definition of right concentration in the Pāli discourses by listing all four jhānas may not intend to stipulate

810   •   A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya


While the Saccavibha�ga-sutta, its Madhyama-āgama parallel, and the individual
translation conclude with the delight of the monks, [259] the Ekottarika-āgama version
concludes by reporting that the delivery of this discourse by Sāriputta led innumerable
beings to stream-entry. [260]


[[MN142]] Dakkhi�āvibha�ga-sutta

The Dakkhi�āvibha�ga-sutta, the “discourse on an analysis of offerings”, surveys the
merits that accrue from offering to different types of recipient. This discourse has a
parallel in the Madhyama-āgama and a parallel in an individual translation. [261]
In addition, a version of this discourse is also extant in a Gāndhārī fragment. [262] Parts
of the earlier section of this discourse can also be found in Sanskrit fragments and in
fragments of the Maitrisimit, preserved in Tocharian and Uighur. [263] Another parallel


the attainment of all four jhānas in order for the noble eightfold path to lead to full awakening. The additional stipulation made in [[MA31]] that right concentration needs to be based on the perspective of the
four noble truths squares well with an exposition on the topic of proper effacement given in [[MN8]] at
MN I 42,27 and [[MA91]] at T I 573c20. These two discourses agree in reckoning right concentration as
an instance of proper effacement, yet [[MN8]] at MN I 40,30 and [[MA91]] at T I 573b28 also agree that
mere attainment of the jhānas falls short of being proper effacement. In the light of [[MA31]] this could
be understood to imply that attainment of a jhāna only becomes an instance of right concentration −
and therewith an instance of proper effacement − when it takes place based on the four noble truths’
perspective, thereby with the insight that such attainment is also of an ultimately unsatisfactory nature.
259 According to [[MA31]] at T I 469c5, Sāriputta concluded his exposition with a verse in praise of the Buddha’s teaching of the four noble truths, a verse which has a prose counterpart in T 32 at T I 816c26.
260 [[EA27.1]] at T II 643b26. [[EA27.1]] at T II 643b29 then concludes with the monks delighting in what the
Buddha had said,,, which in view of the fact that the discourse had been given
by Sāriputta does not fit the context too well.
261 The parallels are [[MA180]] at T I 721c-723a and T 84 at T I 903b-904b. According to the information
given in the Taishō edition, T 84 was translated by Dānapāla ( ). While [[MA180]] has the title “discourse to Gotamī”,, T 84 has the title “discourse on an analysis spoken by the Buddha on
giving”,, which according to Tsukamoto 1985: 1097 might render Dak�i�āvibha�gasūtra. The title Dak�i�āvibha�ga occurs also in a reference to a passage from the present discourse in
the Karmavibha�ga in Kudo 2004: 122,9 or in Lévi 1932a: 61,5, while the title “discourse to Gotamī”
recurs in a quotation from the present discourse in the Chinese Udāna collection, T 212 at T IV 679c14.
Ps I 187,5 quotes a passage from the present discourse and refers to it as Dakkhi�āvisuddhi-sutta, cf.
also B [e] -Pj I 222 and B 諸比丘聞佛所說 [e] -Mp-� I 103, a title taken from the exposition of four types of purity in regard to 歡喜
giving described in the final part of the discourse. [[MA180]] and T 84 agree with [[MN142]] on the location. [[MA180]] and T 84 have been translated in Tsukamoto 1985: 1093-1100. Discourse quotations that
parallel the examination of the merit of giving to various recipients in [[MN142]] at MN III 255, 施護 15 can be
found in Abhidh-k 3:42 and 4:117 in Pradhan 1967: 155, 瞿曇彌經 5 and 270,5; cf. also T 1558 at T XXIX 56a1
and T XXIX 96b 佛說分別布施經 15, as well as T 1559 at T XXIX 213a11 and T XXIX 250b29.
262 The parallel is Bajaur Kharo��hī fragment 1; two extracts from this fragment have been published by
Strauch 2008: 20-21, which parallel the exposition on the four purifications of a gift found in [[MN142]]
at MN III 256,13 and the first of the seven offerings in [[MN142]] at MN III 255,28 (I am indebted to Ingo
Strauch for kindly providing me with a draft transliteration and translation of the whole fragment).
263 The Sanskrit fragments are SHT III 979 (pp. 241-242, cf. also SHT VIII p. 186) and the so far unpub

can be found in a discourse quotation in Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya, extant in Tibetan. [264] The beginning part of the Dakkhi�āvibha�ga-sutta
has also a counterpart in two individual translations and in the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya,
where it forms part of this Vinaya’s account of the events that led to the founding of
the order of nuns. [265]
The Dakkhi�āvibha�ga-sutta, the Madhyama-āgama version, the individual translation, the Gāndhārī fragment, and the Tibetan parallel in Śamathadeva’s commentary on
the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya begin by narrating how Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī tried for up
to three times to offer a robe to the Buddha, [266] who told her to offer it to the monastic
community instead. [267] The Mahīśāsaka Vinaya and the two individually translated dis

lished fragment no. 2379/15 of the Schøyen collection, identified by Peter Skilling (I am indebted to
Jens-Uwe Hartmann for kindly providing me with a preliminary draft transliteration of this fragment).
The Tocharian fragments have been published and translated in Xianlin 1998: 169-189, while the Uighur
fragments have been published and translated in Geng 1988: 191-209 and Tekin 1980: 69-70 (being
unable to read Tocharian or Uighur, my study is based on the translations provided with the editions of
these texts). Regarding the Uighur fragment in Geng, the interpretation of this passage by Laut 1991:
266-268 (an interpretation accepted by Pinault 1991: 181 and Schmidt 1996: 276) seems to be based on
a confusion of the community of noble ones with the monastic community (which are in fact easily
confounded, cf. Hirakawa 1966: 131 for what appears to be another such case). Closer inspection indicates that the Maitrisimit does not implicitly refer to the foundation of the order of nuns, as assumed by
Laut, but only to the attainment of stream-entry by Gautamī and her companions (cf. in more detail
Anālayo 2008h: 107 and Hüsken 2000: 46 note 9). The parts that have been preserved in the Sanskrit and
Uighur fragments correspond to the introductory section in [[MN142]] at MN III 253-254, the Uighur
fragment in Geng 1988: 200-204 also covers the seven kinds of offerings and the fourteen types of personal offering described in [[MN142]] at MN III 254-256.

and Lamotte 1958/1988: 703-705 for these and several other related tales.
266 In T 84 at T I 903c7 she offers it with the explanation that “it was only for the Blessed One that I made
this robe, may the Buddha accept it”,, preceded by her indication in T
84 at T I 903c2 that she had made this robe with her own hands, . Ps V 67,18 describes her
reasoning in a similar way, “this [robe] has been spun and woven by me personally for the Blessed One,
thus, venerable sir, let the Blessed One accept it”, ida� pana me bhagavanta� uddissa sāma� kanta�
sāma� vāyita�, ta� me, bhante, bhagavā pa�igganhātū ti. The Uighur fragment folio 1b2231-2238 in
Geng 1988: 172 even reports that Gautamī had personally sown the cotton, weeded, watered, and harvested it, before spinning the thread and then weaving the cloth. Regarding the nature of the cloth that
she tried to offer to the Buddha, while T 84 at T I 903b29 agrees with [[MN142]] at MN III 253,3 on simply
speaking of a “new” cloth, [[MA180]] at T I 721c25 specifies that it was not only new but also made of
golden [coloured] thread, as do D (4094) mngon pa, ju 254a1 or Q (5595) tu 289b1, T 202 at T IV 434a8,

courses that parallel only the introductory narration of the Dakkhi�āvibha�ga-sutta also
report that the Buddha refused her gift and told her that she should give the robe to the
community instead. [268]
The Dakkhi�āvibha�ga-sutta, its Madhyama-āgama parallel, the Tibetan parallel,
and the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya report that Ānanda intervened on behalf of Mahāpajāpatī
Gotamī by reminding the Buddha of her services when she acted as his fostermother,
after his own mother had passed away. [269]
Ānanda’s reminding the Buddha of his debt of gratitude to his fostermother can also
be found in a different context in the Dharmaguptaka, Mahāsā�ghika, (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda, and Theravāda Vinayas, [270] and in a discourse in the A�guttara-nikāya, together
with its two Chinese discourse parallels. [271] In these instances, Ānanda’s reminder had
the purpose of convincing the Buddha to allow women to go forth as Buddhist nuns. [272]
Placing these accounts side by side with the Dakkhi�āvibha�ga-sutta and its parallels
suggests that Ānanda reminded the Buddha on two occasions of his debt of gratitude to
Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī. Curiously enough, while in relation to the relatively insignifi
might deem worthy of gifts; cf. also the discussion in Mil 240,1. A reference to the present event can also
be found in the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-(upadeśa-)śāstra, T 1509 at T XXV 225b9, cf. Lamotte 1970a:
1403, in T 212 at T IV 691b13 (as part of a prose narration to a verse that parallels [[UD6.2]] at [[UD66.12]]),
and in the travel records by Făxiăn ( ), T 2085 at T LI 861b3, translated in Legge 1886/1998: 66;
cf. also Silk 2002/2003 for an examination of a range of texts on the meritoriousness of giving to the Buddha or to the monastic community respectively, thematized in the injunction given in the present discourse.
268 T 1421 at T XXII 185b22, T 202 at T IV 434a13, and T 203 at T IV 470a19. T 202 and T 203 continue
by reporting that after the Buddha had refused and explained the reasons for his refusal, she attempted
to give the robe to the community of monks, but none of the monks dared to take the robe, until finally
the monk Maitreya ( ) accepted it. The same two versions then continue to relate what took place
when the next day Maitreya wore the robe and went begging, so that the remainder of T 202 and T 203
no longer parallels [[MN142]] Notably, T 203 at T IV 470a15 renders the name of the Buddha’s fostermother as, which Brough 1975: 582 explains to be due to a misunderstanding of a Prākrit form 法顯
of her name as being an equivalent of priyapada or priyapatha.

and T 1421 at T XXII 185c11. Bajaur Kharo��hī fragment 1 line 7 appears to report a similar intervention, although in the parts that have been preserved Ānanda is not explicitly mentioned. T 84 at T I
903c11 differs in so far as it does not record that Ānanda reminded the Buddha of his debt of gratitude
to his fostermother. On the Buddha’s indebtedness to Gautamī cf. also Ohnuma 2006.

for his intervention on their behalf; cf. also the travel records of Xuánzàng ( ), T 2087 at T LI 890b16,
translated in Beal 1884/2001a: 181. Deeg 2005: 142 notes that the worship paid by the nuns to the memory of Ānanda is also recorded in the Mahāsā�ghika Vinaya, cf. Roth 1970: 314,27.

cant issue of accepting a gift Ānanda’s intervention was not successful, the same argument was apparently more successful as part of an attempt to convince the Buddha to
permit women to go forth, even though according to the same sources the Buddha presumably knew that this permission was going to considerably shorten the duration of
his dispensation. [273]
According to the main Chinese and Tibetan parallels to the Dakkhi�āvibha�ga-sutta,
in reply to this reminder by Ānanda the Buddha explained that he also had benefited
Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī, as due to him she had gone for refuge and taken the five precepts, was free from doubt in the three jewels, and had acquired insight into the four
noble truths. [274] This listing of benefits implies that she had become a stream-enterer.
According to the Majjhima-nikāya discourse, however, it was Ānanda who mentioned
the benefits that Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī had derived from her association with the Buddha. The different Vinaya accounts agree with the Madhyama-āgama version, the individual translation, and the Tibetan parallel, as they also report that it was the Buddha
who had taken up the topic of how he had benefited his foster mother, [275] a presentation
that receives further support from the Gāndhārī, Sanskrit, Tocharian, and Uighur fragments. [276]
The Dakkhi�āvibha�ga-sutta and its main Chinese and Tibetan parallels continue by
describing the debt of gratitude one owes to the person who establishes one in taking
refuge, in observing the precepts, in acquiring unwavering confidence in the three jewels, and in going beyond doubt in regard to the four noble truths. [277]

273 For an examination of this prophecy of future decline cf. Nattier 1991: 28-33, a theme also taken up in
the Mahāsā�ghika Vinaya in Roth 1970: 16,14; cf. also Anālayo 2010o.
274 [[MA180]] at T I 722a12 adds that she had also acquired faith, morality, learning, generosity, and wisdom,
, cf. also the Mahāsā�ghika Vinaya in Roth 1970: 15,11: śraddhayā vardhati,
śīlena vardhati, śrutena vardhati, tyāgena vardhati, prajñayā vardhati.
275 The Mahīśāsaka Vinaya, T 1421 at T XXII 185c13, only mentions her acquisition of faith in the three
jewels. The individual translation, T 84 at T I 903c22, and the Mahāsā�ghika Vinaya in Roth 1970:
15,13 add to this her insight into the four noble truths. The Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, T 1428 at T XXII
923a21, reports that she attained the right path. The (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, T 1451 at T XXIV
350c23, explicitly speaks of her stream-entry, an attainment implicit in the descriptions given in the
other texts. D (4094) mngon pa, ju 254b4 or Q (5595) tu 290a5 goes still further, however, as it indicates that she had reached the fruit of non-returning, phyir mi ’ong ba’i ’bras bu rtogs te. [[MA116]] at T
I 605c17 and T 60 at T I 856c10 list the same benefits as [[MA180]] whereas [[AN8.51]] does not take up
成就信, the topic of how the Buddha had benefited his foster mother at all. Her attainment of stream-entry is 戒, 多聞, 施, 慧
mentioned also in the Mahāvastu in Basak 1968/2004: 154,17 or in Senart 1897: 257,15.
276 Bajaur Kharo��hī fragment 1 line 8, SHT III 979V5, YQ 1.41 1/2a1-7 in Xianlin 1998: 176, folio 7b2623 8a2643 in Geng 1988: 198-200, and fragment 199 recto 3 in Tekin 1980: 70. Judging from the dynamics of the exchange between the Buddha and Ānanda, the presentation in the parallel versions would fit
the context better than the account in [[MN142]] since such a statement would come naturally as a reply
to Ānanda’s intervention.
277 Bajaur Kharo��hī fragment 1 lines 11-18 has preserved parts of what appears to have been a similar presentation. A related treatment can be found in [[AN5.27]] at AN I 123,13, which highlights the benefit derived from those who are instrumental in helping one to become established in refuge, to attain streamentry, and to attain full awakening.



MN III 254


814   •   A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya


A noteworthy aspect in the individual translation is that it refers to Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī throughout as a nun. [278] At first sight this may seem surprising, since according to
the Dakkhi�āvibha�ga-sutta and its parallels one of the benefits she had acquired thanks
to the Buddha was her observance of the five precepts, which suggests her to be still a
laywoman. Moreover, if at the time of the present event she already had been a nun,
one would expect her going forth to be mentioned among the benefits she had derived
from the Buddha, all the more so as according to a range of accounts it was on her request that the nun’s order had been instituted in the first place. [279]
Yet, if Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī was indeed the first woman to receive the going forth as
a Buddhist nun, then at the time of the present discourse she should already be a nun,
as all three versions explicitly mention the community of nuns in their examination of
the merits that accrue from different recipients of gifts. [280] A reference to the existence
of the order of nuns would not fit an event in which Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī takes part as
a laywoman. [281]
Perhaps the reference to her observance of the five precepts could be understood to
be simply a part of the pericope used to describe her taking of refuge, both together
referring to the moment when she had become a lay follower. On adopting this viewpoint, her having taken the five precepts need not necessarily imply that she was still a
laywoman at the time of the present discourse, but would only refer to the point of time
in the past when she had become a lay follower. If the main point of this description of
benefits was to highlight that she had become a Buddhist and a stream-enterer, then the
absence of any explicit reference to her going forth may become less puzzling. [282]


278 T 84 at T I 903c22: .
279 The discourse versions of this account are [[AN8.51]] at AN IV 276,21, [[MA116]] at T I 605c28, and T 60
at T I 857a22. Vinaya reports of the same can be found in the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, T 1428 at T XXII
923a27, in the (presumably) Haimavata Vinaya, T 1463 at T XXIV 803b12, in the Mahāsā�ghika Vinaya in Roth 1970: 18,14 (the corresponding section in the Chinese version, T 1425 at T XXII 514b4, is
abbreviated), in the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya, T 1421 at T XXII 185c19, in the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya,
T 1451 at T XXIV 350c26, and in the Theravāda Vinaya at Vin II 255,4. The Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, T
1435 at T XXIII 290c23, does not give a full account.
280 [[MN142]] at MN III 255,33, [[MA180]] at T I 722a28, and T 84 at T I 904a18; cf. also folio 8b2659 in Geng
1988: 200.
281 Williams 2000: 170 摩訶波闍波提苾芻尼 alternatively suggests that the order of nuns may have been in existence already and
the story of its foundation at the request of Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī in the Vinaya “may have been added
on by later compilers of the text”; for an examination of this suggestion cf. Anālayo 2008h: 108-110.
282 Another problem could seem to be the circumstance that her attainment of full liberation is also not
mentioned, an attainment that according to Thī-[[AN136.13]] she reached soon after her going forth. In fact,
another discourse concerned with benefits derived through the help of others, [[AN5.27]] at AN I 123,13,
lists the benefits of becoming established in refuge, of attaining stream-entry, and of attaining full awakening. From this listing it would seem that, had Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī already reached full awakening
by the time of the present discourse, this would merit explicit mentioning. Yet, the expression na cirass’
eva, used in Thī-[[AN136.13]] to describe the period it took her to reach full liberation, is used in other contexts for larger periods of time, cf., e.g., [[MN82]] at MN II 61,3, according to which Ra��hapāla similarly
became an arahant “in no long time”, na cirass’ eva, with the commentary at Ps III 293,7 then explain

Chapter 14 Vibha�ga-vagga                                    -  815


Another point to be taken into consideration is that the different Vinayas record a stipulation according to which it was allowable for a monk to accept the gift of a robe from
a nun if they were relatives. [283] Hence, independent of whether the present event took
place before or after this regulation, for Gotamī to give a robe to the Buddha would in
principle have been possible even if she had already gone forth. [284]
The Dakkhi�āvibha�ga-sutta and its main parallels agree that the Buddha took the
opportunity to examine different recipients of a gift by describing fourteen types of
personal offering and seven types of offering to the monastic community. They differ in
the sequence in which they present these two topics (see table 14.5). [285]
The fourteen recipients of personal offerings are presented in the parallel versions in
similar ways, [286] although here, too, a difference in sequence manifests in as much as
the individual translation and the Gāndhārī fragment begin with the lowest recipient, [287]
whereas the other versions start off with the foremost recipient. While the Madhyamaāgama and Tibetan versions, as well as the Gāndhārī fragment, agree with the Majjhi
ing that it took him twelve years (a prolonged time period similarly reflected in the parallels to [[MN82]]
which speak of nine or ten years, cf. [[MA132]] at T I 624b6, T 68 at T I 869c26, T 69 at T I 872c26, and
D (1) ’dul ba, kha 103a1 or Q (1030) ge 95a4). Thus, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī’s offering of a robe to the
Buddha could find a placing at some point during the time period between her going forth and her attainment of full liberation.

283 This regulation is the nissaggiya pācittiya or ni�sargikā� pātayantika rule 4 in the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, T 1428 at T XXII 606c11; rule 4 in the Mahāsā�ghika Vinaya, T 1425 at T XXII 299c19; rule 4 in
the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya, T 1421 at T XXII 26c6; rule 5 in the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, T 1442 at T
XXIII 727a29; rule 4 in the Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, T 1435 at T XXIII 42c13; and rule 5 in the Theravāda
Vinaya at Vin III 209,15. According to this regulation, a monk should not accept the gift of a robe from
a nun that is not related to him.
284 Another argument in favour of her lay status would be that, according to [[MN142]] at MN III 253,8, she
had personally spun and woven the robe, sāma� kanta� sāma� vāyita�, an activity not befitting a nun.
Yet, according to the Chinese parallels she had only “made” the robe, which could intend just their sewing, an activity quite appropriate for a monastic, cf. [[MA180]] at T 721c26: and T 84 at T
I 903c2: .
285 T 84 at T I 903c27 and Bajaur Kharo��hī fragment 1 line 18 agree in this respect with [[MN142]] at MN III
254,28. [[MA180]] at T I 722a21 and D (4094) mngon pa, ju 255a1 or Q (5595) tu 290a8 take up the same
topics in the opposite order, as they first examine the seven types of offering to the monastic community and only after that turn to the fourteen individual recipients, cf. [[MA180]] at T I 722b14 and D (4094)
mngon pa, ju 255b2 or Q (5595) tu 291a2, a sequence also found in the Sanskrit, Tocharian, and Uighur
fragments, cf. SHT III 979R6, YQ 1.41 1/1b1-8 in Xianlin 1998: 176-178, folio 8a2649 in Geng 1988:
200, and fragment 199 verso 7-9 in Tekin 1980: 69.
286 A minor difference is that while [[MN142]] at MN III 255,9, T 84 at T I 903c28, D (4094) mngon pa, ju
255b6 or Q (5595) tu 291a8, and Bajaur Kharo��hī fragment 1 line 19 envisage giving either to a virtu- 我自為世尊作
ous person or else to someone who is not virtuous, [[MA180]] at T I 722b 我自手作 19 takes up this pair by contrasting someone who is energetic with someone who is not energetic, . The qualification of a Tathāgata as the supreme recipient of a gift, found in all versions, recurs also in the *Karmavibha�gopadeśa in Lévi 1932a: 156,13 as a quotation from the present discourse. A variation among the
Pāli editions is that B [e] -MN III 297,24 and S [e] -MN III 459,2 speak of giving to a paccekasambuddha,
while E [e] -MN III 254,30 and C [e] -MN III 522,28 refer to the same recipient as a paccekabuddha.

ma-nikāya discourse in ranking a gift to an animal as the lowest in their respective
listings, [288] in the individual translation the lowest recipient of gifts is someone who is
sick. [289]


Table 14.5: Analysis of Gifts in [[MN142]] and its Parallels

MN III 255  The Dakkhi�āvibha�ga-sutta and its parallels take up the seven types of offering to
the monastic community in similar terms. [290] The Majjhima-nikāya version continues by
describing the case of a gift that is received by evil and immoral monks. It explains that


288 [[MN142]] at MN III 255,14, [[MA180]] at T I 722b20, Bajaur Kharo��hī fragment 1 line 19; cf. also YQ 1.20
1/1b1 in Xianlin 1998: 182 and folio 9a2703 in Geng 1988: 204. The reference to the merit of giving to
an animal occurs as a discourse quotation in the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya, Abhidh-k 4:117 in Pradhan
1967: 270,5, with its Chinese counterparts in T 1558 at T XXIX 96b15 and T 1559 at T XXIX 250c1.
The discourse quotation in Abhidh-k-� that parallels [[MN142]] taking this quote as its starting point, cf. D
(4094) mngon pa, ju 253b7 or Q (5595) tu 289a7. The circumstance that in these listings an animal
ranks lower than an immoral person is put into question in the *Tattvasiddhi, T 1646 at T XXXII 291c16;
cf. also Schmithausen 2009: 95.
289 T 84 at T I 903c27: “he practises giving to a sick and suffering person”, . T 84 also
differs from the other versions in the numerical value of the result it attributes to the different recipients. [[MN142]] [[MA180]] Abhidh-k-�, and Bajaur Kharo��hī fragment 1 attribute a hundred-fold result to
the lowest gift, given to an animal, and then mention a thousand-fold result for giving to an immoral or
not energetic worldling, a hundred-thousand-fold result for giving to a virtuous or energetic worldling,
a hundred-thousand times a hundred-thousand-fold (or a million-fold) result for giving to an outsider
free from lust, and an immeasurable result for giving to a noble one; cf. also folio 9b in Geng 1988:
204. T 84 at T I 904a8 begins with a twofold result for giving to someone who is sick, followed by a
hundred-fold result for giving to an immoral worldling, a thousand-fold result for giving to a virtuous
worldling, and a hundred-thousand-fold result for giving to an outsider free from lust, until it similarly
mentions the immeasurable result for giving to a noble one. In [[EA23.1]] at T II 609b 於病苦人而行布施 13, King Pasenadi
refers to a version of this exposition, which he claims to have heard from the Buddha, according to which
a hundred-fold result is to be expected in case of making an offering of food to an animal, a thousandfold result for making an offering to an immoral person, a ten-thousand-fold result if the recipient is a
virtuous person, a hundred-million-fold result if the offering is given to a seer who is free from lust, and
an immeasurable result in the case of making an offering to one who is on the path to stream-entry.
290 A minor difference is that, whereas [[MN142]] at MN III 255,29 begins its listing with a gift given to both
communities headed by the Buddha, buddhapamukhe ubhatosa�ghe dāna� deti, the parallels only
speak of the monk community headed by the Buddha, [[MA180]] at T I 722a23:, T 84 at T
I 904a16: D (4094) mngon pa, ju 255a1 or Q (5595) tu 290a8: sangs rgyas la mngon
du phyogs te dge slong gi dge ’dun. The same is also the case for Bajaur Kharo��hī fragment 1 line 35
(corresponding to part 2 line 5 in Strauch 2008: 21): budhap[r]amu[hasa] (bhi)[kh](usa�ghasa). Another minor difference is that [[MA180]] at T I 722a26 does not list an offering given by requesting the appointment of some monks and some nuns, mentioned in [[MN142]] at MN III 255,34, T 84 at T I 904a21,
and D (4094) mngon pa, ju 255a3 or Q (5595) tu 290b3.
施佛及比丘眾

Chapter 14 Vibha�ga-vagga                                    -  817


such an offering will nevertheless be of incalculable merit, as long as the gift is given
to the community as a whole. [291]
Notably, the individual translation and the parts that have been preserved in the
Gāndhārī fragment do not take up this case at all. The Madhyama-āgama discourse and
the Tibetan version have a comparable treatment, although this differs from the Majjhima-nikāya version. Both do not speak of evil and immoral monks as the recipients of
gifts given to the community. While the Tibetan version does not provide any explicit
ethical qualification of such monks, [292] in the Madhyama-āgama account such monks
are just not energetic. [293]
The Madhyama-āgama version then continues by explaining that, when even a gift to
a monk who is not energetic is of great merit on account of being given to the community, what can be said of the merit of giving to a monk who practises and has reached
various accomplishments.
The Majjhima-nikāya version instead states that a gift to an individual will never be
as meritorious as a gift given to the whole community. [294] The commentary reports the
reasoning that a gift given to the community will be purified on account of former arahants like Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna. [295] The commentary further explains that even
a gift given to an arahant individually will not measure up to a gift given to someone of
bad morality, as long as the gift is given to the latter on behalf of the community as a
whole. [296]

291 [[MN142]] at MN III 256,7 predicts that in the future there will be “clan members, with yellow robes
around their necks, immoral and of evil character”, gotrabhuno kāsāvaka��hā dussīlā pāpadhammā.
Ruegg 1974: 200 comments that “this reference to evil gotrabhūs seems ... to be isolated in the Pāli
canon”, as in [[AN9.10]] at AN IV 373,7 and [[AN10.41]] at AN V 23,7 the same term rather stands for a
someone about to become a noble one; on the term cf. also, e.g., Boucher 2008: 233 note 234, Dayal
1932/1970: 51, Norman 1987/1992: 163, Ruegg 1969: 456, id. 1974, id. 1981, von Hinüber 1978/1994:
93, Wijesekera 1979: 382, and Wright 1996: 46. The expression kāsāvaka��ha recurs in [[DHP|DHP307]] (= It
2:11 at It 43,3 and Vin III 90,25).
292 D (4094) mngon pa, ju 255a4 or Q (5595) tu 290b4.
293 [[MA180]] at T I 722b1: . The Uighur fragment folio 8b2668-2670 in Geng 1988: 202
seems to be similar to [[MN142]] however, as it speaks of an undisciplined and lawless monk, as is the
case for a quotation from the present discourse in the Chinese Udāna collection, T 212 at T IV 679c15.
On, the equivalent to the gotrabhū in [[MN142]] cf. also Takasaki 1993: 256; the counterpart to this
term in D (4094) mngon pa, ju 255a4 or Q (5595) tu 290b4 is sa’i rigs.
294 [[MN142]] at MN III 256,10: “I say that in no way is a gift given to an individual person of greater fruit
than a gift given to the community”, na ... kenaci pariyāyena sa�ghagatāya dakkhi�āya pā�ipuggalika� dāna� mahapphalatara� vadāmi (S [e] -MN III 461,4: pā�ipuggalikadāna�). De Silva 1990a: 33
notes that “this statement is contradictory to ideas expressed elsewhere, that what is given to the virtuous is greatly beneficial but not what is given to the immoral. It is evident here that a later interpolation
cannot be altogether ruled 名姓種, out”. Witanachchi 不精進 2006a: 701 comments that this statement “is a far cry from
the place given to moral discipline and spiritual development in [other] early discourses”.
295 Ps V 75,15. An extract from the present discussion already appeared in Anālayo 2005c: 102-103.
296 Ps V 75, 姓種 28; cf. also [[EA48.5]] at T II 791c29 which, although not speaking of a someone of bad morality,
nevertheless highlights the superiority of giving to a single member from the monastic community compared to giving to five hundred arahants. On the question of giving to an evil monk cf. also Mil 257,4.



MN III 256


818   •   A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya


The suggestion that a gift given on behalf of the order, even if it is given to an immoral monk, will be of incalculable merit seems difficult to reconcile with the subsequent exposition of the four purifications of a gift in the Dakkhi�āvibha�ga-sutta and
its parallels, which clearly indicates that the purification of a gift depends also on the
degree of purity of the receiver. [297]
From this perspective, it seems doubtful if the existence of former arahant monks
would suffice to turn a gift given on behalf of the community to a monk of evil character and bad morality into a gift that produces abundant merit. In fact, if dedicating a gift
to the Buddhist order would suffice to ensure the fruitfulness of such a gift, it would be
difficult to understand why elsewhere the discourses give so much importance to the
ethical purity of a recipient of gifts. [298]
In view of the absence of such a reference to the fruitfulness of giving to immoral
monks in the parallel versions, it seems quite possible that this particular passage in the
Dakkhi�āvibha�ga-sutta is a later addition to the discourse. The present reference thus
could be reflecting the concerns of later generations of monastics to ensure constant
supplies and therewith their safe survival among competing religious groups in ancient
India even in case some members of the Buddhist monastic community should not be
able to maintain the proper standards of moral conduct.

MN III 257  After surveying the four purifications of a gift in similar ways, [299] the Dakkhi�āvibha�ga-sutta, its Madhyama-āgama parallel, the Gāndhārī fragment, and the Tibetan

297 [[MN142]] at MN III 256,20 refers to such purity only in terms of being “virtuous and of good character”,
sīlavā kalyā�adhammo, a reference found similarly in Bajaur Kharo��hī fragment 1 line 67 (corresponding to part 3 line 13 in Strauch 2008: 20: śilava bhoti kalanadha�mo, cf. also lines 10-11). [[MA180]] at T
I 722c3 speaks of being energetic and having the right view that there is karmic retribution for deeds,
while T 84 at T I 904a27 deals with the same topic in terms of purity of bodily, verbal, and mental action, purity of livelihood, and purity of view (the listing of the four types of purification in T 84 seems to
have suffered from some textual error). The four purifications of a gift recur in [[AN4.78]] at AN II 80,26.
298 Thus, e.g., [[MN39]] at MN I 271,16 or [[MN40]] at MN I 281,10, in agreement with their parallels [[MA182]]
at T I 724c25 and [[MA183]] at T I 725c24, give recommendations to monks on proper conduct in order to
ensure that gifts given to them will be fruitful. [[MN6]] at MN I 33,16 and its parallel [[MA105]] at T I 595c23
stipulate morality and meditation practice as the factors required to make the services and support a monk
receives become fruitful. The same theme recurs also in other discourses, according to which a gift given
to a moral recipient is of much fruit, unlike the gift given to an immoral recipient, cf. [[SN22.21]] at SN I
98,27 (or SN [2] 135 at SN [2] I 220,3): sīlavato ... dinna� mahapphala�, no tathā dussīle, [[AN3.97]] at AN I
246,32: bhikkhu hoti dussīlo ... yesa� kho pana pa�iga�hāti cīvarapi��apātasenāsanagilānapaccayabhesajjaparikkhāra� tesa� ta� na mahaphala� hoti na mahānisa�sa�. Notably, both of these discourses use the same expression dussīla as found in the passage under discussion, [[MN142]] at MN III
256,7. Similarly in [[AN5.199]] at AN III 244,7 a description of how someone gone forth can become a
source of merit in various ways invariably stipulates that he or she should be sīlavant; cf. also Freiberger
2005: 238.
299 [[MA180]] at T I 722c3 and D (4094) mngon pa, ju 256a7 or Q (5595) tu 292a2 are more detailed in their
description of what makes a giver or recipient pure, indicating that this also requires upholding the view
that there are future results of one’s actions. Fragment 2379/15 of the Schøyen collection appears to
have preserved part of this exposition. A discourse quotation paralleling the reference to a gift given by
one free from passion to one who is also free from passion in [[MN142]] at MN III 257,22 can be found in


Chapter 14 Vibha�ga-vagga                                    -  819


version conclude with a set of stanzas on how a gift may be purified by the giver or by
the recipient. [300] The individual translation instead reports that, on hearing this exposition on the merits of giving to the community, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī decided to give
the robe to the community of monks. [301]

300 To the five verses found in [[MN142]] at MN III 257,6 and Bajaur Kharo��hī fragment 1 line 73, the parallels [[MA180]] at T I 723a1 and D (4094) mngon pa, ju 257a5 or Q (5595) tu 293a1 add a sixth verse in
praise of gifts made by slaves and the poor. For a translation of the six verses in [[MA180]] and a comparison with their Pāli counterparts cf. Minh Chau 1964/1991: 191-192. [[MA180]] at T I 723a5 also differs from [[MN142]] by reporting the delighted reaction of Ānanda and the assembled monks. Ānanda’s
delighted reaction is also mentioned in Bajaur Kharo��hī fragment 1 line 80.

## Chapter 15 Sa�āyatana-vagga

[[MN143]] Anāthapi��ikovāda-sutta

The Anāthapi��ikovāda-sutta, the “discourse on an instruction to Anāthapi��ika”, records the teachings given by Sāriputta to the dying Anāthapi��ika. The Anāthapi��ikovāda-sutta has a parallel in the Ekottarika-āgama. [1] The first part of the Anāthapi��ikovāda-sutta, which reports Sāriputta’s visit to Anāthapi��ika, has also a parallel in the
Sa�yukta-āgama, [2] while the later part of the Anāthapi��ikovāda-sutta, which takes
place after Anāthapi��ika’s death, has a Pāli parallel in the Sa�yutta-nikāya and two
Chinese parallels found in two Sa�yukta-āgama collections. [3]
The Anāthapi��ikovāda-sutta begins by narrating that Anāthapi��ika, who was sick,
dispatched a messenger to Sāriputta with an invitation to visit him. [4] The Sa�yukta-āgama and Ekottarika-āgama versions do not record such an invitation, in fact according to
them, Sāriputta had decided on his own to pay a visit to Anāthapi��ika. While the Sa�yukta-āgama version indicates that Sāriputta had heard about the sick condition of Anāthapi��ika, [5] according to the Ekottarika-āgama version, Sāriputta had come to know
about it through his divine eye. [6]
The Anāthapi��ikovāda-sutta reports that, when Sāriputta arrived together with Ānanda at Anāthapi��ika’s dwelling place, the householder described his deteriorating condition to the visiting monks with a set of similes. [7] According to the Ekottarika-āgama
version, however, Anāthapi��ika merely stated that his condition was getting worse,
without making use of any simile. [8]


1 The parallel is [[EA51.8]] at T II 819b-820c, which agrees with [[MN143]] on locating the discourse in Jeta’s
Grove by Sāvatthī. Akanuma 1929/1990: 171 also lists [[MA28]] at T I 458b-461b as a parallel to [[MN143]]
The instructions given by Sāriputta to Anāthapi��ika in [[MA28]] however, rather parallel [[SN55.26]] at SN
V 380-385, a discourse that also agrees with [[MA28]] in reporting that Anāthapi��ika recovered from his
disease. Hence [[MA28]] together with a Sanskrit fragment parallel to [[MA28]] SHT VI 1397 (pp. 116-117),
are better reckoned as parallels to [[SN55.26]] Yet another discourse given to Anāthapi��ika at a time when
he was sick is [[SN55.27]] at SN V 385-387, in which Ānanda is the speaker.
2 The parallel to Sāriputta’s visit to Anāthapi��ika is [[SA1032]] at T II 269c-270a, which agrees with [[MN143]] on locating the discourse in Jeta’s Grove by Sāvatthī. For a translation of [[SA1032]] together with
extracts from the present study, cf. Anālayo 2010n.
3 The parallels to Anāthapi��ika’s post mortem visit to the Buddha are [[SN2.20]] at SN I 55-56 (or [[SN2]] 101
at SN [2] I 126-129), [[SA593]] at T II 158b-c, and SĀ [2] 187 at T II 441a-442a. SĀ [2] 187 at T II 441a28 also covers the events that took place before, although, according to its account, it was not Sāriputta who went to
visit Anāthapi��ika on his deathbed, but rather the Buddha himself. According to SĀ [2] 187 at T II 441b13,
the instruction given by the Buddha on this occasion was concerned with the six recollections.

822   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


The Anāthapi��ikovāda-sutta and its two parallels in the Sa�yukta-āgama and the
Ekottarika-āgama agree that Sāriputta instructed Anāthapi��ika on the development of
detachment towards various aspects of experience. [9] In all versions, these instructions
take up the six objects of the senses, encouraging Anāthapi��ika to avoid clinging to
them and not to let his consciousness become dependent on them. While the Majjhimanikāya version simply speaks of consciousness being dependent on the senses or their
objects, [10] the Sa�yukta-āgama version specifies that such dependence takes place
through the arising of desire and lust. [11] The Anāthapi��ikovāda-sutta stands alone in
also applying the instructions to the six types of consciousness, the six types of contact,
and the six types of feeling that arise based on them (see table 15.1).


Table 15.1: Instructions to Anāthapi��ika in [[MN143]] and its Parallels

The Ekottarika-āgama version’s instructions on detachment do not mention the
senses, but only their objects, although later on this discourse takes up the senses for a


V 381,19 (a discourse which is not a parallel to [[MN143]]) also does not employ any simile to illustrate
the householder’s sick condition. In contrast, SĀ [2] 187 at T II 441b5 (a discourse that otherwise does not
parallel the first part of [[MN143]]) does report that Anāthapi��ika illustrated his sick condition with the
image of a rope tightened around the head, of a butcher cutting up the belly of an ox, and of two strong
man roasting a weak man over a fire, thereby paralleling similes used in [[MN143]]
9 Preceding these instructions, according to [[EA51.8]] at T II 819b21 Sāriputta also told Anāthapi��ika to
develop recollection of the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sa�gha. SĀ [2] 187 at T II 441b13 similarly reports that the Buddha taught Anāthapi��ika these recollections, as well as recollection of morality, of
generosity, and of devas. The descriptions of a noble disciple’s unwavering confidence, found as part of
the instructions given to Anāthapi��ika in [[SN55.26]] at SN V 381,26 and SN V 382,3+11, also uses the
formulations employed in these three recollections, although without explicitly instructing on the practice of recollection. [[EA51.8]] at T II 819c2 continues by proclaiming that undertaking the three recollections will ensure that rebirth does not take place in the three evil realms. For another instance where
these recollections are given particular importance in the Ekottarika-āgama cf. above p. 513 note 340.

more detailed treatment, explaining that, when a sense arises, one does not know from
where it comes, and when it ceases, one does not know where it goes. [12] The Ekottarika-āgama discourse continues by highlighting that all things manifest by way of dependent arising (pa�icca samuppāda), a principle it then expounds by way of the twelve
links from ignorance to old age and death. [13]
The Sa�yukta-āgama version agrees with the Majjhima-nikāya account in examining
the six elements and the five aggregates in a similar manner. [14] These are not found in
the Ekottarika-āgama version, which, however, agrees with the Majjhima-nikāya discourse in taking up this world and the next world. [15] The Majjhima-nikāya version
stands alone in also taking up the four immaterial attainments and what is seen, heard,
sensed, and cognised as experiences in regard to which Anāthapi��ika should avoid
clinging and dependencies. [16]
The parallels report that, at the end of Sāriputta’s instruction, Anāthapi��ika was in
tears, as in spite of his devoted service to the Buddha and the monks he had never received such a penetrative instruction. In the Majjhima-nikāya and Sa�yukta-āgama
versions, Anāthapi��ika is told that such discourses are generally not given to laity. [17]


12 [[EA51.8]] at T II 819c14: “at the time of the arising of the eye, when it arises one does not know from
where it comes, at the time of the cessation of the eye, when it ceases one does not know where it goes”,
(adopting a and variant reading
that adds after in the case of arising, in analogy to the case of cessation), a treatment that [[EA51.8]] at T II 819c21 then applies also to the sense-objects (with the first of the sense-objects, form, not
being explicitly mentioned). Baba 2004: 946 points out that this type of presentation is not found in the
Pāli discourses, but occurs only in commentarial Pāli literature, such as Vism 484,6, according to which
the sense-spheres “do not come from anywhere before they arise, do not go anywhere after they cease”,
na hi tāni pubbe udayā kutoci āgacchanti, na pi uddha� vayā kuhiñci gacchanti. Baba concludes that
this instance exemplifies a tendency for Āgama discourses to incorporate modes of presentation that in
the Pāli tradition have not made their way into the discourses, but are found only in commentarial literature (cf. also above p. 616 note 154).

only at this point of its treatment. In contrast, [[MN143]] at MN III 259, 則起 時 12 and [[SA1032]] at T II 269c16 take
up the senses as their first topic, together with the objects of the senses, a passage whose counterpart in
[[EA51.8]] at T II 819c5 only covers the sense-objects. [[EA51.8]] at T II 819c24 concludes by explaining
that to develop insight into the dependent arising of the senses and their objects is the supreme dwelling
in emptiness.

16 [[MN143]] at MN III 260,34. Whereas what is seen, heard, sensed, and cognised fits the present context
well, the reference to the four immaterial attainments is to some extent puzzling, as the way other discourses depict Anāthapi��ika does not give any indication that he might have been a meditator of such
proficiency as to be capable of entering the immaterial attainments. This impression is confirmed by the
fact that, according to all versions, on passing away Anāthapi��ika was reborn in a heavenly world of the
sensual sphere. From this it would follow that he had not been even a jhāna attainer. Thus, it is surprising
to find him being instructed on avoiding clinging to experiences that would have been far beyond his
range of experience.
17 [[MN143]] at MN III 261,22: “such talk on the Dharma, householder, is [usually] not given to lay people

MN III 261


824   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


In reply, Anāthapi��ika requested that such instructions be given to lay followers in
the future. [18]

MN III 262 The Anāthapi��ikovāda-sutta and its Chinese parallels report that Anāthapi��ika
passed away soon after Sāriputta’s visit. According to the Majjhima-nikāya discourse
and one of the Sa�yukta-āgama versions that parallel this part of the Anāthapi��ikovāda-sutta, he was reborn in the Tusita heaven, [19] while the Ekottarika-āgama version locates his rebirth in the heaven of the Thirty-three. [20]
The Anāthapi��ikovāda-sutta and its parallels report that, reborn as a deva, Anāthapi��ika visited the Buddha and spoke a set of stanzas. [21] The next day, when the Bud

also reads dhammikathā and does not have the second kho). Ps V 80,13 explains the reason for this to be
that lay followers usually do not like such instructions, since they live immersed in possessions and do
not appreciate being instructed to give up desire and attachment to these. The identity of the speaker of
this explanation is not clear in [[MN143]] since no explicit indication is made and the preceding sentence
is spoken by Ānanda, while Anāthapi��ika’s reply is addressed to Sāriputta. According to [[SA1032]] at T
II 269c27, it was Sāriputta who explained to Anāthapi��ika that for a long time he had not given such
teachings to householders. [[EA51.8]] at T II 819c30 reports that Ānanda gave a longer explanation to Anāthapi��ika, distinguishing between two types of disciple. The point made by this explanation might be
that teaching methods differ according to the propensity of individual disciples. For a discussion of why
Anāthapi��ika did not receive such instructions earlier cf. Anālayo 2010n: 8-12 and Falk 1990: 130.
18 [[SA1032]] at T II 270a3 adds that Anāthapi��ika also offered food to Sāriputta, after which this discourse
ends. For the remainder of [[MN143]] the relevant parallel in the Sa�yukta-āgama is [[SA593]] at T II 158b24,
which begins by reporting that Anāthapi��ika had just passed away.
19 [[MN143]] at MN III 262,1 and [[SA593]] at T II 158b25. [[SA2]] 187 at T II 441c12 does not specify in which
heaven he had been reborn.
20 [[EA51.8]] at T II 820a16. [[EA51.8]] notes that, as a devaputta, Anāthapi��ika excelled other devas in life
span, beauty, happiness, might, and radiance.
21 [[MN143]] at MN III 262,8 (on these stanzas cf. also Franke 1912: 218-221) and [[SN2.20]] at SN I 55,12 (or
SN [2] 101 at SN [2] I 126,13). The first of these stanzas, in which Anāthapi��ika expresses joy at beholding
Jeta’s Grove inhabited by sages and the king of the Dharma, recurs in all Chinese versions, although [[SA593]] at T II 158c3 speaks of “kings”,, instead of the king or lord of Dharma, dhammarāja/ /
, mentioned in [[MN143]] at MN III 262,9, [[SN2.20]] at SN I 55,13 (or SN [2] 101 at SN [2] I 126,15), SĀ [2] 187
at T II 441c17, and [[EA51.8]] at T II 820a26. [[EA51.8]] has only this first stanza. [[SA593]] at T II 158c4 and
SĀ [2] 187 at T II 441c18 also have a counterpart to the second stanza in [[MN143]] at MN III 262,10 and [[SN2.20]] at SN I 55,14 (or SN [2] 101 at SN [2] I 126,17), according to which purity is to be reached through deeds
and morality. The same two discourses also have a counterpart to the fourth stanza in [[MN143]] at MN III
262,14 and [[SN2.20]] at SN I 55,18 (or SN [2] 101 at SN [2] I 127,6), although their praises of Sāriputta differ
from the Pāli versions. According to [[EA51.8]] at T II 820b1, the visiting deva also informed the Buddha
of his identity and scattered heavenly flowers on the Buddha as well as on Ānanda and Sāriputta. This
would imply that Ānanda was present when the deva revealed his identity, which does not fit too well
with the remainder of the same discourse, as according to [[EA51.8]] at T II 820b 諸王 12 the Buddha asked 法主 法
Ānanda who that 王 deva could have been and then praised Ānanda for rightly divining that it had been
Anāthapi��ika. The four stanzas found in [[MN143]] and [[SN2.20]] recur again as a discourse on its own in
[[SN1.48]] at SN I 33,23 (or SN [2] 48 at SN [2] I 71,3). In regard to the first of these four stanzas, it may also be
worthwhile to note that this stanza does not imply that the Buddha had already passed away and Sāri

Chapter 15 Sa�āyatana-vagga                                     -  825


dha told the monks about this visit, Ānanda was quick to divine that this deva had been
Anāthapi��ika.
The Majjhima-nikāya version and one of the two Sa�yukta-āgama versions end with
the Buddha’s approval of Ānanda’s inference. [22] The other of the two Sa�yukta-āgama
versions adds a stanza spoken by the Buddha in praise of Sāriputta, [23] while according
to the Ekottarika-āgama account the Buddha delivered a long prose passage in praise
of Ānanda. [24]


[[MN144]] Channovāda-sutta

The Channovāda-sutta, the “discourse on an instruction to Channa”, records the
events related to Channa’s suicide. This discourse recurs in the Sa�yutta-nikāya and
has a parallel in the Sa�yukta-āgama. [25]
The Channovāda-sutta and its parallels begin by narrating that Sāriputta and another
monk went to visit Channa, who was sick. The Pāli and Chinese versions disagree on
the identity of this other monk, as according to the Pāli versions Sāriputta was accompanied by Mahācunda, while according to the Sa�yukta-āgama version he was in the
company of Mahāko��hita. [26]
When Sāriputta and his companion came to Channa’s presence, [27] Channa told his
visitors that his condition was getting worse and that he had decided to commit suicide.
According to all versions, Sāriputta attempted to stop Channa from committing suicide
and offered to get supplies for him or to act as his attendant, [28] to which Channa replied
by indicating that he did not lack any of these. According to the Pāli versions, at this
point Channa proclaimed that his suicide was going to be blameless. [29] According to the


putta was now the leader of the community, as assumed by Aramaki 2005: 789, in fact according to [[SN47.13]] at SN V 161,24, [[SA638]] at T II 176c1, and [[EA26.9]] at T II 640c14 Sāriputta passed away earlier
than the Buddha. Regarding the motif of a visit paid by a deceased disciple, Feer 1884a: 22 notes that in
the Avadānaśataka it is a standard procedure that former disciples, on being reborn as devas, pay a visit
to the Buddha.

25 The Pāli parallel is [[SN35.87]] at SN IV 55-60 and has the title Channa-sutta. The Chinese parallel is [[SA1266]] at T II 347b-348a, for which Akanuma 1929/1990: 112 notes “Channa”,, as a tentative title;
for a translation of [[SA1266]] together with extracts from the present study, cf. Anālayo 2010b. The three
versions agree on locating the discourse at Rājagaha.
26 [[SA1266]] at T II 347b18: .
27 According to [[SA1266]] at T II 347b22, on seeing the two monks coming from afar, Channa tried to get
up from his bed as a sign of respect, but Sāriputta told him to stay where he was. A similar pericope can
be found, e.g., in [[SN22.87]] at SN III 120,1, [[SN22.88]] at SN III 125,3, [[SN35.74]] at SN IV 46,14, [[SN35.75]]
at SN IV 47,32, or [[AN6.56]] at AN III 379,15.
28 While according to [[MN144]] at MN III 264,14 and [[SN35.87]] at SN IV 57,11 Sāriputta offered to supply
Channa with food and medicine, according to [[SA1266]] at T II 347c2 he only offered medicine.

Sa�yukta-āgama account, however, Channa only indicated that the pains he had were
hard to bear. [30]

MN III 265  The parallel versions report that Sāriputta inquired if Channa took the senses, the corresponding consciousness, or the objects of the senses as a self or as belonging to a
self. [31] Channa explained that he did not take any of these as a self or as belonging to a
self, as he had seen and known their cessation.

MN III 266 The monk who had come together with Sāriputta intervened at this point and reminded
Channa of a statement made by the Buddha, according to which only one who is free
from agitation and dependencies has fully transcended dukkha. [32] According to the
Sa�yukta-āgama account, in reply to this admonishment Channa declared to have
honoured the Buddha with what is pleasing, adding that he had done what should be
done, thereby implicitly laying claim to being an arahant. [33] Channa’s claim to have
honoured the Buddha with what is pleasing is also found at an earlier junction in the
Pāli versions, where it comes together with Channa’s declaration that his suicide will
be blameless. [34]

wish to kill myself, [since] I do not delight in a life of pain”,
.
31 [[MN144]] at MN III 265,7 and [[SN35.87]] at SN IV 58,10 mention, besides each sense and the corresponding type of consciousness, also the “things”, dharmas, to be experienced through this type of consciousness, e.g., in the case of the eye, cakkhuviññā�aviññātabbe dhamme. [[SA1266]] at T II 347c9 differs in
formulation in regard to the last of these three, as it explicitly names the type of sense object, e.g., “form(s)
cognisable through the eye”, .
32 [[MN144]] at MN III 266,6 and [[SN35.87]] at SN IV 59,10 examine the negative case only in short by proclaiming that “for one who is dependent there is agitation”, nissitassa calita�, after which they take up
the positive case of being free from such dependencies. [[SA1266]] at T II 347c25 takes up both cases in
full, explaining that “if there is dependency, there is agitation. 但我疾病苦痛逼身, If there is agitation, 難可堪忍, there is inclination. 欲自殺, 不 If
there is inclination, there is no tranquillity. If there is no tranquillity, then there arises coming and going. 樂苦生
If coming and going arises, then there is future birth and death ... in this way, this entire great mass of
dukkha arises”,
(adopting the and variant reading instead
of ), followed by presenting the positive case in the same terms, i.e., “when there is no dependency ...
in this way this entire great mass of 眼所識色 dukkha ceases”. A version of the statement found in [[MN144]] and
[[SN35.87]] recurs in [[UD8.4]] at [[UD81.6]] (with the reading rati instead of nati). [[SA1266]] at T II 347c28
does not have a counterpart to the indication, given in [[MN144]] at MN III 266,9 and [[SN35.87]] at SN IV

The three versions report that Channa committed suicide, after which Sāriputta approached the Buddha and asked where Channa had been reborn. In reply, according to
the Pāli versions the Buddha reminded Sāriputta of Channa’s earlier declaration of
blamelessness, [35] while in the Sa�yukta-āgama version he reminded Sāriputta of Channa’s claim to having honoured the Buddha with what is pleasing. [36] Thus the Buddha’s
reply in the Pāli and Chinese versions, although differing in formulation, clearly endorses Channa’s earlier claim.
According to the Channovāda-sutta and its parallels, Sāriputta remarked that Channa
had closely associated with lay families, [37] a remark apparently meant to explain why
Sāriputta had thought Channa’s claim to be mistaken. In reply, the Buddha clarified
that he did not deem such association blameworthy, as he only considered it blameworthy if someone were to give up the body and then take up another body, which had not
been the case with Channa.
The Buddha’s reply in the Pāli and Chinese versions indicates that Channa passed
away as an arahant. According to the commentarial explanation, at the time of committing suicide Channa was still a worldling and it was only during the interval between
using the knife and passing away that he developed insight and became an arahant. [38]
This commentarial explanation does not seem to fit the discourse too well, as in the
Pāli and Chinese versions the Buddha explicitly states that Channa had used the knife
without incurring blame. [39] This would imply that Channa was already blameless at the
time he used the knife to commit suicide, not only when he passed away. [40]

Th 1185; cf. also [[AN6.103]] AN III 443,24, where full awakening could also be implicit, as here the reference to having honoured the teacher is preceded by kiccakārī ca bhavissāmi. References to a behaviour
that is pleasing occur also in [[AN4.87]] at AN II 88,12 and [[AN5.104]] at AN III 131,25 in a description of
the conduct displayed by monks towards the Buddha.

36 [[SA1266]] at T II 348a17.
37 [[MN144]] at MN III 266,24 indicates that Channa had “families that were his friends, with whom he was
intimate, that he could approach”, mittakulāni suhajjakulāni upavajjakulānī ti (on upavajja in this passage cf. also Bodhi 2000: 1407 notes 56 and 57), cf. also [[SN35.87]] at SN IV 59,29. [[SA1266]] at T II
348a22 indicates that Channa “had families of supporters, he was very intimate with these families and
was spoken well of in these families”, .
38 Ps V 83,19. Keown 1996: 27 comments that “why the commentary should take such pains to establish
that Channa was not an Arhat ... is that the tradition simply found it inconceivable that an Arhat would

1996: 23, who suggests taking anupavajja in the sense of “not being reborn” (following the commentarial gloss at Ps V 82,9: anupavajjan ti anuppattika� appa�isandhika�), instead of understanding anupavajja to mean “not blameworthy”. According to Delhey 2009b: 87, from an early Buddhist perspective “the released one ... can, at least if he is gravely ill, end his life by his own hand 有供養家, 極親厚家, 善言語家 ”. Filliozat 1963: 36

[[MN145]] Pu��ovāda-sutta

The Pu��ovāda-sutta, the “discourse on an instruction to Pu��a”, records the teachings given by the Buddha to Pu��a. This discourse has a Pāli parallel in the Sa�yuttanikāya, [41] and two Chinese parallels, one of which is found in the Sa�yukta-āgama, [42]
while the other Chinese parallel is an individual translation. [43]
In addition to these discourse parallels, the events described in the Pu��ovāda-sutta
recur also in the context of a longer narration found in the Divyāvadāna and in the
Bhai�ajyavastu of the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, preserved in Chinese and Tibetan. [44]

MN III 267  The Pu��ovāda-sutta and its parallels begin by reporting that Pu��a approached the
Buddha and requested an instruction in brief. [45] In reply, the Buddha took up the need to
avoid unwholesome reactions in relation to the objects of the six senses. [46]


Noble Ones who, having completed their work, sever their last link with the world and voluntarily pass
into Nirvā�a”. Schmithausen 2000a: 36 comments that “in contrast to ordinary living beings, saints (i.e.
fully liberated persons, arhats) do not regard their biological life as something valuable and are indifferent to it”. De La Vallée Poussin 1922: 25 remarks that “the arhat ... if he is not, like a Buddha, capable
of abandoning life in a quiet way, there is no reason why he should not have recourse to more drastic
methods”; cf. also Thakur 1963: 109. Wayman 1982: 290 comments that “the example of Channa shows
the acknowledgement of exceptional cases where suicide was justified”. Wiltshire 1983: 137 concludes
that “if this body has lost its essential usefulness ... then the body can be relinquished”; cf. also Anālayo
2007f: 162, Becker 1990: 547, Berglie 1986: 34, Filliozat 1967: 73, and Oberlies 2006: 218.
40 Delhey 2006: 35 concludes that there is “no reason for doubting that he already was released from rebirth when he decided to commit suicide”.
41 [[SN35.88]] at SN IV 60-63. The deeds performed by Pu��a in a former life are the theme of his stanzas in
the Therāpadāna, Ap 399:1-16 at Ap II 341,1. A stanza spoken by Pu��a can also be found at Th 70.
42 [[SA311]] at T II 89b-c, for which Akanuma 1929/1990: 46 notes “Pu��a”,, as a tentative title.
Akanuma 1929/1990: 171 suggests [[SA215]] at T II 54b to be another parallel to [[MN145]] However,
closer inspection shows that [[SA215]] is considerably different from [[MN145]] and should rather be reckoned a parallel to [[SN35.70]] at SN IV 41, with which it agrees closely except for the fact that the protagonist in [[SN35.70]] is the monk Upavāna, whereas [[SA215]] speaks of the monk Pu��a, (which
may have led Akanuma to associate this discourse with [[MN145]]).
43 T 108 at T II 502c-503a, which is entitled “discourse spoken by the Buddha to Mantā�iputta”,
, apparently confusing the protagonist of the present discourse, Pu��a of Sunāparanta, with Pu��a Mantā�iputta from Kapilavatthu. The Taishō edition indicates that the translator of T 108 is not known.
44 The relevant part in the Divyāvadāna can be found in Cowell 1886: 37-40 or in Vaidya 1999: 22-24, the
Chinese (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya tale in T 1448 at T XXIV 11c-12c, and its Tibetan counterpart in 富樓那
D (1) ’dul ba, ka 304b-307b or Q (1030) khe 284b-286b. For representations of this longer narration in
ancient Indian art cf. Sarkar 1990: 152 and Schlingloff 1988b; for a study of its different versions cf.
Tatelman 2000. A version of this longer narration can also be found in T 202 at T IV 393c-397a and in
T 211 at T IV 588b-c (translated in Willemen 1999: 91-93). T 202 at T IV 396c19 and T 211 at T IV 富留那
588c2 mention the events covered in [[MN145]] only briefly, as they simply report that, after Pu��a had
gone forth, the Buddha taught him the Dharma so that he became an arahant. 佛說滿

an instruction in brief.


Chapter 15 Sa�āyatana-vagga                                     -  829


The Pāli versions of this instruction describe how rejoicing in and welcoming the objects of the six senses and holding on to them causes delight, which leads to the arising
of dukkha. [47] The Chinese, Sanskrit, and Tibetan parallels examine the repercussions of
such delighting in more detail than the Pāli versions. [48]
The Pu��ovāda-sutta and its parallels continue by applying their respective treatments to the complementary case, when such unwholesome reactions to the objects of
the six senses are avoided. After delivering these instructions, the Buddha asked Pu��a
where he intended to go in order to put into practice the instructions he had received.
On hearing that Pu��a planned to go to his home country, the Buddha warned Pu��a
of the rude and rough nature of its inhabitants and asked him what he would do if they
were to abuse him. Pu��a replied that, if he were to meet with abuse, he would reflect
on the kindness of the people in as much as they did not give him a blow.
The exchange between the Buddha and Pu��a continues in the same manner with
Pu��a mentioning each time a worse alternative he would reflect on in order to maintain patience, followed by the Buddha inquiring what he would do if that worse alternative should happen. This exchange takes up the possibility that Pu��a might:

 - receive a blow,

 - have a clod thrown at him,

 - be hit with a stick,

 - be attacked with a knife,

 - be deprived of life. [49]

46 According to [[SA311]] at T II 89b5, the Divyāvadāna in Cowell 1886: 37,17 or in Vaidya 1999: 22,28,
and the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, T 1448 at T XXIV 12a6 and at D (1) ’dul ba, ka 305a2 or Q (1030)
khe 284b5, before delivering this instruction the Buddha praised Pu��a for asking such a question.
47 [[MN145]] at MN III 267,16: nandīsamudayā dukkhasamudayo (Ce-MN III 546,16 and Se-MN III 481,15:
nandisamudayā), cf. also [[SN35.88]] at SN IV 60,15. The same instruction recurs in [[SN35.64]] at SN IV
38,1, given by the Buddha to the monk Migajāla.
48 The parallel versions explain with the help of various intermediate steps how such delight eventually
leads to lust, as a result of which one is far from Nirvā�a, cf. [[SA311]] at T II 89b10:
, Cowell 1886: 37,24 or Vaidya 1999: 23,1: ānandī bhavati ... sarāgo bhavati ... ārānnirvā�asyocyate (Bailey 1950: 177 suggests to read sa�rāgo, instead of sarāgo), T 1448 at T XXIV
12a10:, D (1) ’dul ba, ka 305a5 or Q (1030) khe 284b8: kun du dga’ ba ’byung
ngo ... kun du chags par ’gyur ro ... mya ngan las ’das pa las ring du gyur pa zhes bya’o. T 108 at T II
502c16 also relates the arising of delight to lust, which it explains to ultimately result in misery and
vexation.
49 [[MN145]] at MN III 268,11 and [[SN35.88]] at SN IV 61,9 present these as six separate cases. T 108 at T II
502c23 has the same as five cases, combining the attack by stick and knife into one instance. [[SA311]] at
T II 89b21, the Divyāvadāna in Cowell 1886: 38,10 or in Vaidya 1999: 23,11, and the Chinese (Mūla-)
Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, T 1448 at T XXIV 12a20, present the same as four separate cases, by treating at- 歡喜 ... 貪愛, 阨礙
tack with the hand and a clod as one case, and attack with a stick or a knife as one case. The Tibetan 故, 去涅槃遠
(Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya at D (1) ’dul ba, ka 306a1+5+7 or Q (1030) khe 285b2+5+8 covers only
three cases, which are being abused, being hit with a stick, and being killed. Oldenberg 1912b: 162 al 樂欲 ...貪 ... 遠離涅槃  ready noted that, whereas in several other respects the Pāli versions are shorter than the Divyāvadāna
tale, when describing variations of being attacked the Pāli treatments are longer than their parallels. A
similar description of patience when confronted with increasing manifestations of hostility can be found



MN III 268

In case he should be deprived of life, Pu��a explained that he would still be able to
consider this in a positive light, as other disciples had to go searching for means to
commit suicide, whereas he would be achieving the same result without having to do
any searching. [50] According to all versions, the Buddha approved of Pu��a’s patient
attitude and sanctioned Pu��a’s plan to go and live among the fierce people of his
home country. [51]
Pu��a’s patience finds an additional illustration in the Divyāvadāna and in the Chinese and Tibetan versions of the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya tale. According to their
account, once he had arrive in his home country, Pu��a encountered a hunter who,
thinking that to see a monk was inauspicious, got ready to attack Pu��a. [52] On seeing
the hunter rush towards him, Pu��a bared his chest and told the hunter to strike right
there. The hunter was so mollified by this reaction that he not only desisted from his attack, but gave ear to instructions and finally took refuge and the five precepts. [53]

MN III 269  According to the Pu��ovāda-sutta and its parallels, while living in his home country
Pu��a realized the three higher knowledges and converted a substantial number of lay

in the Isibhāsiyāi� in Schubring 1969: 538, noted as a parallel to this part of [[MN145]] by Matsunami
1961: 742 and Nakamura 1983a: 306.
50 [[MN145]] at MN III 269,11 speaks in this context of satthahāraka pariyesanti, “they search for someone
who carries a knife”, cf. also [[SN35.88]] at SN IV 62,24. The Indic original used for translating T 108 appears to have had a similar expression, rendered in T 108 at T II 503a6 as “searching a knife for food”,
, perhaps mistaking √h� for ā+√h�, “nourishing”. The other versions also refer to the possibility of using a knife to commit suicide, cf. [[SA311]] at T II 89c10:, the Divyāvadāna in Cowell
1886: 39,8 or in Vaidya 1999: 23,31: śastram ... ādhārayanti, T 1448 at T XXIV 12b7:, and its
Tibetan counterpart at D (1) ’dul ba, ka 306b2 or Q (1030) khe 286a2: mtshon gyis kyang ’debs par
byed, in addition to which they also mention the possibilities of taking poison, of hanging oneself, and
of jumping down a precipice (T 1448 at T XXIV 12b7 differs in that it only mentions the [taking of]
poison). Blum 2008: 143 holds that the present passage in [[SA311]] affirms that “self-destruction can lead
to emancipation”, an opinion he bases on translating [[SA311]] at T II 89c12:
as implying that “if this putrefying body [is destroyed] through some means that they employ,
then [I] will attain liberation”. I am under the impression that this does not fully capture the sense of the
求刀為食 passage, whose implications are rather that “this rotten body of mine, through little effort I am able to
get rid of it”. The expression can render a range of derivatives of 以刀自殺 √muc and thus need not invariably refer to vimutti or vimukti. In the present context it seems to refer to the body, a way of understand- 以其刀
ing that would allow translating the whole phrase without needing to supplement a verb to the first part,
such as “[is destroyed]”.
51 In the Divyāvadāna and in the Chinese and Tibetan (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, the Buddha not only
accepts Pu��a’s plans, but also tells him to work for the salvation of others, cf. Cowell 1886: 39,14 or
Vaidya 1999: 24,3, T 1448 at T XXIV 12b11, and D (1) ’dul ba, ka 306b 於我朽敗之身, 4 or Q (1030) khe 以少作方便, 286a4, an
便得解脫 instruction recorded also in [[SA311]] at T II 89c15.
52 Cowell 1886: 39,25 or Vaidya 1999: 24,11, T 1448 at T XXIV 12b19, and D (1) ’dul ba, ka 307a2 or Q
(1030) khe 286a8.
53 Tatelman 2000: 87 note 85 points out that the formulation in the 解脫 Divyāvadāna in Cowell 1886: 40,12 or
in Vaidya 1999: 24,23 does not make it unequivocally clear if it was Pu��a who became an arahant, or
rather the hunter. He notes that in the Bodhisattvāvadānakalpalatā 36:47 (cf. Das 1888: 900,2 and 901,2
or Vaidya 1959: 236,2) the hunter also reaches awakening. In the Chinese (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya,
T 1448 at T XXIV 12c5, however, it is clearly Pu��a who became an arahant, .

followers. [54] The Divyāvadāna and the Chinese and Tibetan (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, [55] together with the Pāli commentary, [56] continue by describing how, by dint of his
supernormal power, Pu��a rescued his brother and a group of merchants who were
about to suffer misfortune in the midst of the sea, followed by getting a sandalwood
building constructed for the Buddha and inviting the Buddha to partake of a meal in
this building, [57] an invitation the Buddha accepted by using psychic power to travel
through the air with a group of monks.
The Pu��ovāda-sutta, its Sa�yutta-nikāya parallel, and the individual translation report that, when Pu��a had passed away, the monks approached the Buddha to find out
about his level of accomplishment. In reply, they were told that Pu��a had passed away
as an arahant. The Sa�yukta-āgama discourse also notes that he passed away as an arahant, without, however, reporting an inquiry by the other monks. [58]


[[MN146]] Nandakovāda-sutta

The Nandakovāda-sutta, the “discourse on an instruction by Nandaka”, records the
teachings given by Nandaka to a group of nuns. This discourse has a parallel in the
Sa�yukta-āgama and a parallel in the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, preserved in Chinese and in Tibetan. [59] Several shorter parts of a version of the present discourse are
also extant in Sanskrit fragments. [60]

54 [[SA311]] at T II 89c21, T 108 at T II 503a12, the Divyāvadāna in Cowell 1886: 40,10 or in Vaidya 1999:
24,21, and the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, T 1448 at T XXIV 12c4 and D (1) ’dul ba, ka 307a6 or Q
(1030) khe 286b4, add that he also established a substantial number (‘500’) of dwelling places for the
monastic community.
55 The Divyāvadāna, Cowell 1886: 42,8 or Vaidya 1999: 25,29, and the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, T
1448 at T XXIV 13a29 and D (1) ’dul ba, ka 308b2 or Q (1030) khe 287b6.
56 Ps V 89,1.
57 The construction of this sandalwood building for the Buddha is also recorded in the Karmavibha�ga,

58 [[SA311]] at T II 89c23, which indicates that this happened soon after Pu��a had attained the three higher
knowledges. According to [[SN35.88]] at SN IV 63,7, Pu��a passed away at the end of the same rainy season during which he had converted the laity and had reached liberation himself. [[MN145]] at MN III 269,29
does not give such precise indications on the time of his passing away, only reporting that it took place
after some time.
59 The parallels are [[SA276]] at T II 73c-75c and T 1442 at T XXIII 792a-794a, with its Tibetan counterpart
in D (3) ’dul ba, [[JA50]]b7-59a4 or Q (1032) nye 48b5-56a5, cf. also D (4106) ’dul ba’i ’grel pa, phu 81b83a or Q (5607) mu 94b-96b. The parallel versions agree with [[MN146]] on locating the discourse in Jeta’s
Grove by Sāvatthī. Akanuma 1929/1990: 44 notes “Nanda[ka] teaches the Dharma”,, as a tentative title for [[SA276]] a translation of which, together with extracts from the present study and a translation of the ’dul ba version, can be found in Anālayo 2010a.

providing me with a draft transliteration of this fragment). SHT VI 1226 has preserved numerous short
parts of the whole discourse; SHT XI 4560 corresponds to the final part of Nanadaka’s first teaching
and the Buddha’s comment on this at MN III 275-276.
難陀說法


832   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


MN III 270  The Nandakovāda-sutta begins by relating that Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī, followed by a
group of nuns, had approached the Buddha and requested an instruction. On inquiring
from Ānanda, the Buddha found out that Nandaka had not been willing to take his turn
at teaching the nuns, whereon the Buddha told Nandaka that he should go and give
them a teaching. [61]
The accounts in the Sa�yukta-āgama discourse and in the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya agree with the Majjhima-nikāya account that a group of nuns under the leadership of
Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī had approached the Buddha. They differ from the Majjhima-nikāya account in that they introduce this event with a listing of the names of several
eminent nuns that were dwelling at the nunnery at that time. [62] Another difference is
that, according to the Sa�yukta-āgama discourse and the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, the Buddha taught the Dharma to the nuns. [63] Once the nuns had left, the Buddha
told the monks that he was getting too old to keep on giving talks and asked them to
give instructions to the nuns in his stead. [64]
In agreement with the Majjhima-nikāya version, the Sa�yukta-āgama discourse and
the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya report that Nandaka was not willing to teach the nuns.
The nuns thereon came to visit the Buddha again, who gave them another talk on the
Dharma and, once they had left, inquired from Ānanda whose turn it had been to instruct the nuns. On finding out that Nandaka was not willing to teach the nuns, according to the Sa�yukta-āgama discourse and the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya the Buddha
told Nandaka that he should teach the nuns. [65]

MN III 271   The Nandakovāda-sutta and its parallels report that the next day Nandaka went to the
nuns’ quarters and engaged the nuns in a question and answer catechism on the six
senses, their objects, and the corresponding types of consciousness. [66]
The Sa�yukta-āgama discourse and the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya continue from
these three (i.e., the senses, their objects, and the corresponding types of consciousness)
to the contact that arises in dependence on them, the feelings that arise in dependence

61 Ps V 93,8 explains that this group of nuns had been Nandaka’s wives in a former existence and he was
afraid that another monk with the power to see former existences might find out and think that Nandaka
was not able to separate himself from his former wives.
62 [[SA276]] at T II 73c11, T 1442 at T XXIII 792a19, and D (3) ’dul ba, [[JA50]]b7 or Q (1032) nye 48b5.
63 SHT VI 1226 folio 5Rb-c has preserved (sa�pra)har�ayitvā samāda[pa](yitvā) and (bhagavato bhā�ita)[m-abhi]nanditvā anu(m)o(ditvā), so that in the Sanskrit version the Buddha also gave a talk to the
nuns.
64 While according to [[SA276]] at T II 73c24 the Buddha explained that he was getting too old to give talks
to the nuns, according to T 1442 at T XXIII 792b1 and D (3) ’dul ba, [[JA51]]a7 or Q (1032) nye 49a4 he
indicated that he was too old to give talks to the four assemblies (i.e., monks, nuns, male lay followers,
and female lay followers).
65 Judging from what has been preserved in SHT VI 1226 folio 6V5, the Sanskrit version would have had a
similar statement.
66 [[SA276]] at T II 74a11, T 1442 at T XXIII 792b21, and D (3) ’dul ba, [[JA52]]a5 or Q (1032) nye 49b8 describe how, after begging and taking his meal, Nandaka spent some time in meditation before approaching the nuns. The parallel description in [[MN146]] at MN III 271,2 only records that Nandaka went begging and took his meal, without mentioning that he engaged in meditation after the meal.


Chapter 15 Sa�āyatana-vagga                                     -  833


on contact, and the craving that arises in dependence on feeling (see table 15.2), an
exposition to which the Sa�yukta-āgama discourse further adds perception and intention. [67]


Table 15.2: Nandaka’s Instructions in [[MN146]] and its Parallels








|[[MN146]]|[[SA276]]|T 1442 & ’dul ba|
|---|---|---|
|sense-organs (1)<br>sense-objects (2)<br>consciousness (3)|sense-organs (→ 1)<br>sense-objects (→ 2)<br>consciousness (→ 3)<br>contact<br>feeling<br>perception<br>intention<br>craving|sense-organs (→ 1)<br>sense-objects (→ 2)<br>consciousness (→ 3)<br>contact<br>feeling<br>craving|



According to the Majjhima-nikāya version, Nandaka highlighted the impermanent
nature of each of the senses, their objects, and the corresponding types of consciousness, driving home the point that what is impermanent is unsatisfactory, and what is
unsatisfactory is not fit to be regarded as mine, I, or my self.
In the Sa�yukta-āgama discourse and the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, Nandaka directly approaches the not-self characteristic of all aspects of experience, without referring to impermanence or unsatisfactoriness. [68] According to all versions, the nuns made
it clear that they already had developed insight into the true nature of these aspects of
experience.
The different versions report that Nandaka compared the impermanent nature of feelings that are experienced based on the six senses to the impermanent nature of the light
of a lamp, which depends on oil, wick, and flame. [69]
According to all versions, he further used the image of the impermanent shadow of a
tree to illustrate the nature of feelings experienced in dependence on sense-objects. [70]
The parallels report that he continued with yet another simile, which describes how a
butcher skins a cow by cutting through the tendons that connect flesh and hide, and then
puts the hide back on the cow. In all versions, the flesh of the cow stands for the senses


67 While T 1442 at T XXIII 792c23 and D (3) ’dul ba, [[JA53]]b6 or Q (1032) nye 51a5 only apply the insight
treatment to contact, feeling, and craving, [[SA276]] at T II 74b17 covers contact, feeling, perception, intention, and craving. SHT VI 1226 folio 7Rz appears to have preserved a reference to craving, (ca)k�[u]
sa�sparśajā [t�](��ā).

69 While [[MN146]] at MNN III 273,31 applies the image of the lamp to the dependent nature of the three
types of feeling, [[SA276]] at T II 75a7, T 1442 at T XXIII 793a12, and D (3) ’dul ba, [[JA55]]a2 or Q (1032)
nye 52b1 only use it to illustrate the dependent nature of pleasant feeling.
70 The image of a tree’s shadow recurs in [[AN8.15]] at AN II 198,34, in a context related to the objects of
the six senses.

and the hide for their objects. To cut the connection between them represents the exercise of wisdom that cuts through the bondage of desire and lust between the senses and
their objects. [71]

MN III 275 The Nandakovāda-sutta and its parallels next take up the seven factors of awakening. [72] The Sa�yukta-āgama discourse and the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya lead over to
the practice of the seven factors of awakening with an injunction to go beyond lust, anger, and delusion, and with a recommendation to develop the four satipa��hānas. [73]

MN III 276  After completing his instruction, [74] according to the Sa�yukta-āgama discourse and
the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya Nandaka got up and left, while according to the Majjhima-nikāya version he told the nuns that it was time for them to go. [75]
The Nandakovāda-sutta and its parallels report that the Buddha told Nandaka to instruct the nuns again. The Sa�yukta-āgama discourse and the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya indicate that the nuns had reached non-return with the first teaching delivered by
Nandaka. [76] The Majjhima-nikāya version does not explicitly refer to such attainment,
but only indicates that the intention of the nuns had not been fulfilled. [77] The different

71 [[SA276]] at T II 75b9+11, T 1442 at T XXIII 793b16+21, and D (3) ’dul ba, [[JA56]]b2+5 or Q (1032) nye
53b6+54a1 additionally explain that the “cow” stands for the physical body and the “butcher” stands for
the noble disciple or the disciple in higher training. A version of this simile can be found in the Yogācārabhūmi, T 1579 at T XXX 748a6, for the Tibetan version cf. Schmithausen 1969: 44,27.
72 [[MN146]] at MN III 275,26 describes how the seven awakening factors are developed based on seclusion,
dispassion, cessation, and relinquishment, a specification not made in the corresponding passage in [[SA276]] at T II 75b18, T 1442 at T XXIII 793b29, or D (3) ’dul ba, [[JA57]]a3 or Q (1032) nye 54a6.
73 [[SA276]] at T II 75b17, moreover, enjoins to contemplate the arising and passing away of the five aggregates and of the six spheres. The same is also mentioned in D (3) ’dul ba, [[JA57]]a1 or Q (1032) nye 54a5,
while T 1442 at T XXIII 793c1 additionally brings in the noble eightfold path. The need to beware of
lust, anger, and delusion, mentioned in [[SA276]] and T 1442, recurs in another discourse by Nandaka, [[AN3.66]] at AN I 194,5. Yet another discourse by Nandaka, which takes up the five advantages of listening
to the Dharma, can be found in [[AN9.4]] at AN IV 361,3.
74 The instructions given in the present discourse would presumably be earlier than the regulation found at
Vin IV 52,12, according to which a monk who instructs the nuns should begin by ascertaining if they
were keeping the eight garudharmas, cf. Hüsken 1997: 454 and Sujāto 2009: 67-68. Alternatively, it
could also be that such a formulaic beginning of an exhortation given to the nuns was not considered
worth recording and for this reason has not found a place in [[MN146]] and its parallels.
75 [[MN146]] at MN III 276,2: “go, sisters, it is time”, gacchatha, bhaginiyo, kālo. This is to some extent surprising, since Nandaka had come to the nunnery to give his talk, so that it would be more natural for him
to leave, instead of telling the nuns to go. The same injunction gacchatha bhaginiyo recurs in Vin IV
50,7, Vin IV 51,18, and Vin IV 54,29 in situations where it is clear that a group of nuns has approached
monk(s) in order to receive instructions. Thus, the conclusion of this talk in [[MN146]] reads as if the nuns
had come to the monks’ quarters in order to receive instructions from Nandaka, an impression strengthened by the circumstance that [[MN146]] at MN III 276,6 continues by reporting that the nuns also paid
their respect to the Buddha and then left. [[SA276]] at T II 75b23, T 1442 at T XXIII 793c7, and D (3) ’dul
ba, [[JA57]]a7 or Q (1032) nye 54b2 also report that the nuns went to the Buddha’s presence, although according to T 1442 this took place only the next morning.
76 [[SA276]] at T II 75c2, T 1442 at T XXIII 793c12, and D (3) ’dul ba, [[JA57]]b7 or Q (1032) nye 55a2, the
same is the case for SHT XI 4560R4, which has preserved a part of the present section.

versions agree on comparing the situation of the nuns to the day before the full moon,
when the moon is not yet completely full.
The Majjhima-nikāya version indicates that, when teaching the nuns again, Nandaka
repeated exactly the same instruction he had already given on the first instance. [78] The
Sa�yukta-āgama discourse and the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya only report that he
taught the Dharma to the nuns, so that in their versions it is not clear if he repeated the
same instruction or else if he gave some other teachings. [79]
According to the Majjhima-nikāya account, with this second instruction by Nandaka
the intention of the nuns had been fulfilled, since the least developed of them had
reached stream-entry. The commentary explains that some nuns had only aspired to
become stream-enterers, so they realized only that much, while others had aspired to a
higher level of awakening and had in due turn been able to fulfil their aspirations. [80]
According to the Sa�yukta-āgama discourse and the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya,
however, on hearing Nandaka’s second instruction all of the nuns had become arahants. [81]
The Nandakovāda-sutta and its Chinese parallels agree that the Buddha compared
the attainment reached by the nuns to the full moon. [82] This illustration fits well with the
Sa�yukta-āgama discourse and the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, according to which
all of the nuns had reached the final goal. [83] That the nuns had all reached full liberation
also receives support from several Pāli commentaries, according to which with Nandaka’s second instruction the nuns had indeed all become arahants. [84]

78 Falk 1989: 162 suggests that perhaps “the implication is that they were a little on the slow side”.
79 [[SA276]] at T II 75c6, T 1442 at T XXIII 794a3, and D (3) ’dul ba, [[JA58]]b1 or Q (1032) nye 55b3.

82 While according to [[MN146]] at MN III 277,10 the image of the full moon illustrates that the intention of
the nuns had been fulfilled through Nandaka’s teaching, according to [[SA276]] at T II 75c11, T 1442 at T
XXIII 794a12, and D (3) ’dul ba, [[JA59]]a4 or Q (1032) nye 56a5 the same image illustrates their attainment of full awakening through Nandaka’s teaching. Hu-von Hinüber 1996: 92-93 clarifies that the comparison with the moon on the 14 [th] and 15 [th] day does not necessarily imply that the nuns were taught on
two successive days.
83 Cf., e.g., [[SN22.3]] at [[SNP637]] and [[DHP|DHP413]] where the image of the pure moon stands for those who have
reached full awakening. Another example can be found in Th 306, which compares one who has destroyed
the net of craving to the moon on a clear full-moon night. These instances make it probable that the simile used in [[MN146]] and its parallels intends to illustrate the attainment of full awakening.
84 This statement is found in the commentarial gloss on [[AN1.75]] at AN I 25,10, which reckons Nandaka as
outstanding for instructing the nuns (the counterpart [[EA4.5]] at T II 558a3 reckons Nandaka to be outstanding for teaching disciples in general). Mp I 314,11 explains that with his first teaching Nandaka established all the nuns in stream-entry, sabbā va tā bhikkhuniyo ... dhammadesanāya sotāpattiphale pati��hāpesi, while on hearing his instructions the next day they all reached full awakening, tā punadivase
dhamma� sutvā sabbāva arahatta� pattā. Th-a II 116,24, Thī-[[AN4.14]] and Thī-[[AN136.14]] also report their
attainment of full awakening with Nandaka’s second teaching. It is rather surprising that these Pāli commentaries should agree with the Sa�yukta-āgama discourse and the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya against
the Pāli discourse. Falk 1989: 162 takes [[MN146]] to be a case where “stories initially intended to celebrate
the nuns’ achievements had been altered to play down their accomplishments”.



MN III 277


836   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


[[MN147]] Cū�arāhulovāda-sutta

The Cū�arāhulovāda-sutta, the “lesser discourse on an instruction to Rāhula”, records the meditation instruction that led to the full awakening of Rāhula. This discourse
recurs in the Sa�yutta-nikāya and has a Chinese parallel in the Sa�yukta-āgama. [85]

MN III 277  The two Pāli versions begin by reporting that Rāhula’s mental development had ripened sufficiently for him to be led to awakening. [86] Unlike the Pāli versions, the Sa�yukta-āgama version also describes what led to this mental ripening of Rāhula. According to its report, Rāhula had approached the Buddha and requested to be given a teaching so that he could retreat into seclusion and practise intensively in order to reach
awakening. The Buddha knew that Rāhula’s mind at this point was not yet ripe and
told Rāhula that he should teach others the subject of the five aggregates. [87]
When Rāhula had delivered teachings on the five aggregates, he again approached
the Buddha and requested teachings for retiring into seclusion and undertaking intensive practice. The Buddha saw that Rāhula’s mind was still not ripe enough and told
him that he should also teach on the six sense-spheres. [88] The same happened again for
a third time, when the Buddha indicated that Rāhula should also give teachings on conditionality. [89]
When Rāhula had given teachings on conditionality and again requested instruction
for retiring into seclusion, the Buddha told Rāhula that he should retire into seclusion
and take as his meditation subject the three topics on which he earlier had given teachings, i.e., the five aggregates, the six sense-spheres, and conditionality.
While being in seclusion, Rāhula reviewed and examined these three topics, until he
came to understand that they all lead to the realization of Nirvā�a. [90] When the Buddha
heard Rāhula reporting this insight, he knew that Rāhula’s mind had sufficiently ripened for him to be led to awakening. [91]

85 The parallels are [[SN35.121]] at SN IV 105-107, entitled Rāhula-sutta, and [[SA200]] at T II 51a-c, for which
Akanuma 1929/1990: 39 notes “Rāhula”,, as a tentative title. A translation of [[SA200]] and [[SN35.121]] together with extracts from the present study, can be found in Anālayo 2011h. The three versions agree in locating the discourse in Jeta’s Grove by Sāvatthī.
86 [[MN147]] at MN III 277,25: paripakkā kho rāhulassa vimuttiparipācaniyā dhammā (Be-MN III 325,1, CeMN III 574,5, and S [e] -MN III 504,5: vimuttiparipācanīyā); cf. also [[SN35.121]] at SN IV 105,15.
87 [[SA200]] at T II 51a23 indicates that Rāhula’s “liberation of the mind and wisdom are not yet mature, [he
is] not yet ready to receive the higher Dharma”, .
88 [[SA200]] at T II 51b4.
89 [[SA200]] at T II 51b13: .
90 [[SA200]] at T II 51b23: “all these teachings proceed towards Nirvā�a, flow towards Nirvā�a, behind them
stands Nirvā�a”, 羅睺羅 .
91 Although [[MN147]] and [[SN35.121]] do not record any preliminary stages of training Rāhula, or that he
wished to undertake intensive practice in seclusion, another set of discourses in the Sa�yutta-nikāya,
[[SN18.1-5]] at SN II 244-247, reports how Rāhula approached the Buddha and requested to be given a
teaching so that he could retire into seclusion and undertake intensive practice. In reply to this request,
according to [[SN18.1-5]] the Buddha delivered a set of instructions that are closely similar to the instructions in [[MN147]] and [[SN35.121]] with the main difference that each aspect of experience (such as the 心解脫慧未熟, 未堪任受增上法
senses, their objects, etc.) forms the topic of a separate discourse. Another difference is that [[SN18.5]] at
尼陀那法
此諸法一切皆順趣涅槃, 流注涅槃, 後住涅槃


Chapter 15 Sa�āyatana-vagga                                     -  837


The actual instructions given to Rāhula in the Cū�arāhulovāda-sutta and its parallels
are to contemplate the six senses – together with their respective objects, types of consciousness, and contact – as impermanent, unsatisfactory, and not-self. [92] The Pāli versions of the Cū�arāhulovāda-sutta combine this instruction with the aggregates and
with the principle of conditionality, as they proceed from contact to the four mental aggregates that arise in dependence on contact. [93]
This part of the Pāli versions thus takes up the topics mentioned in the Sa�yuktaāgama version’s introductory account of Rāhula’s development, namely the six sensespheres, the five aggregates, and conditionality. Hence, in spite of substantially different modes of presentation, the Pāli and Chinese versions agree that Rāhula’s development of insight revolved around these three topics.
The Cū�arāhulovāda-sutta and its parallels report that Rāhula reached full awakening.
Whereas according to the Pāli versions this took place while the Buddha was delivering the discourse, [94] according to the Sa�yukta-āgama discourse the same happened
after Rāhula had retired into seclusion and undertaken further practice. [95] The Pāli versions also report that a congregation of devas, which had been following the Buddha in
order to witness the instruction to Rāhula, reached stream-entry through this discourse.
The Sa�yukta-āgama version does not mention their presence at all.


SN II 247,4 only mentions that feelings are conditioned by contact, whereas [[MN147]] at MN III 279,5
highlights that all four mental aggregates are conditioned by contact. The counterpart to [[SN18.1-5]] [[SA897]] at T II 225b11, reports a considerably shorter instruction, which just enjoins to contemplate the six
sense-spheres, without taking up their impermanent nature or mentioning any other insight perspective
to be used for such contemplation. [[SA897]] at T II 225b17 continues by indicating that this mode of contemplation is to be applied in the same way (up to) the five aggregates,
(a standard mode of abbreviation, used frequently in the Sa�yukta-āgama), so that perhaps the
same range of topics should be supplemented as mentioned in [[SN18.1-10]] which covers the senses,
their objects, consciousness, contact, feeling, perception, volition, craving, the six elements, and the five
aggregates. [[SA897]] also differs from [[SN18.1]] in as much as, according to its account, Rāhula had not
asked for a teaching so that he could withdraw into seclusion. Instead, he rather had inquired how to
avoid giving attention to any sign in regard to this body with its consciousness and in regard to external
elements, T II 225b9: . The first part of this instruction is similar to
the recurrent expression imasmiñ ca saviññā�ake kāye bahiddhā ca sabbanimittesu, found, e.g., in [[MN109]] at MN III 18,30; on this expression cf. also Bucknell 1999b: 325. An account similar in several respects to [[SA200]] can be found in T 212 at T IV 626b27, where the Buddha tells Rāhula that he should 如是外六入處, 乃至五陰亦
recite teachings on dependent arising, then on the five aggregates, and finally on the six types of contact. 如是說
Rāhula then attains liberation after he has subsequently reflected on the significance of these teachings,
cf. T 212 at 626c12.
92 [[SA200]] at T II 51c3 refers to this teaching only in an abbreviated manner, indicating that the instruction
given in the present instance on the impermanent nature of the senses, their objects, the corresponding
types of consciousness and contact are the same “as spoken above in detail on impermanence”,
. This could refer to the instructions found in [[SA196]] at T II 50a 我此識身及外境界, 一切相不憶念 26, which proceed from impermanence to a whole range of insight perspectives, including among others also dukkha and not-self.

[[MN148]] Chachakka-sutta

The Chachakka-sutta, the “discourse on the six sixes”, examines the absence of a self
in all aspects of six sense-door experience. This discourse has a parallel in the Sa�yukta-āgama, [96] as well as in a discourse quotation in Śamathadeva’s commentary on the
Abhidharmakośabhā�ya, extant in Tibetan translation. [97] Parts of the Chachakka-sutta
have also been preserved in Sanskrit fragments. [98]

MN III 280  The Chachakka-sutta and its parallels begin with an announcement by the Buddha
that he will give a teaching that is good in the beginning, middle, and end, and reveal a
pure and perfect holy life. [99] In other Pāli discourses, the qualification of being good in
the beginning, middle, and end, etc., occurs regularly as a description of the Dharma,
although not as an introduction to a discourse. [100] In the Chinese Āgamas, however, the
same qualification serves this introductory function also on other occasions. [101]


96 The parallel is [[SA304]] at T II 86c-87a, which takes place at Kammāsadhamma in the Kuru country and
has the title “discourse on the teaching of the six sixes”, (given at T II 87a24). A reference to
the present discourse in the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya speaks of the �a��a�ko dharmaparyāya�/,
cf. Abhidh-k 3:30 in Pradhan 1967: 143,8, T 1558 at T XXIX 52b16, and T 1559 at T XXIX 209b4.
Akanuma 1929/1990: 171 also lists [[MA86]] at T I 562a-566a as a parallel to [[MN148]] [[MA86]] begins by
reporting that Ānanda had come with a group of young monks to the Buddha and asked how he should
instruct these monks. In reply, the Buddha takes up the five aggregates, then the six senses in a way that
parallels [[MN148]] after which he continues by teaching a broad range of other topics, covering the six
elements, dependent arising, the four satipa��hānas, the four right efforts, the four ways to [psychic]
power, the four jhānas, the four noble truths, four perceptions, the four divine abodes, the four immaterial attainments, the four ariyava�sas, the four fruits of recluse-ship, five perceptions ripening in liberation, the five spheres of liberation, the five faculties and powers, 六六法經 the five elements of release, seven types
of (spiritual) wealth, seven powers, the seven factors of awakening, the eightfold noble path, and the 六六法門
summit of the Dharma (cf. also Minh Chau 1964/1991: 35-36). Thus, apart from an overlap of its treatment of the six senses with part of the exposition given in [[MN148]] [[MA86]] differs to such an extent from
[[MN148]] that it can safely be concluded that the two discourses stem from different occasions. On the
parallelism between the topics covered in [[MA86]] and the Dharmaskandha cf. Watanabe 1983/1996: 54.

99 Part of this statement has also been preserved in the Sanskrit fragment, cf. SHT VI 1226 folio 24Rb:

The Chachakka-sutta and its parallels take up six sets of sixes as the basis of their exposition, which are:

 - the six senses,

 - the six sense-objects,

 - the six types of consciousness,

 - the six types of contact,

 - the six types of feeling,

 - the six types of craving. [102]
The three versions examine the not-self nature of all these aspects of experience in
similar terms, explaining that, since they are impermanent, to identify them as a self
would imply that the self arises and passes away.
A difference is that the Pāli and Tibetan versions apply the same treatment also to
craving. [103] While the Sa�yukta-āgama discourse agrees with the other versions on including craving in the earlier listing of the six sets of sixes, it does not take up the possibility that craving could be identified as a self. The Sa�yukta-āgama version concludes by indicating that contemplating as devoid of self the three types of feeling,
arisen in dependence on the senses, leads to Nirvā�a. [104]
The Pāli version approaches the same topic in a different manner, as it contrasts the
path leading to the arising of personality (by identifying with these aspects of experience) with the path leading to the cessation of personality (by contemplating their notself nature). The Chachakka-sutta continues by giving a more detailed treatment to the
three types of feeling, depicting how pleasant feeling leads to attachment and painful
feeling to aversion, while with neutral feeling its advantage, its disadvantage and the
escape from it is ignored. Only by going beyond these unwholesome reactions and the
corresponding underlying tendencies can liberation be attained.
While the Tibetan version does not refer to the theme of personality, it takes up the
three types of feeling for a similar treatment. [105] The Tibetan version concludes its expo
at T I 701b25, [[MA177]] at T I 716b17, [[SA297]] at T II 84c12, [[SA305]] at T II 87a28, [[SA334]] at T II 92b22,
[[SA335]] at T II 92c13, [[EA16.6]] at T II 580b4, [[EA40.6]] at T II 740a26, and [[EA44.6]] at T II 766a6; cf. also
the Mahāvyutpatti no. 1280-1289 in Sakaki 1926: 97-98, where the same qualifications form the beginning of a listing under the heading of dharmaparyāya�.
102 The same six sets of sixes recur again in the Sa�yukta-āgama, T II 91c-92b, as part of a set of consecutive discourses, each of which takes up one of these sixes: [[SA323]] (senses), [[SA324]] (objects), [[SA325]]
(consciousness), [[SA326]] (contact), [[SA327]] (feeling), and [[SA330]] (craving), all of which take place in
Jeta’s Grove. For Sanskrit fragment parallels to these discourses cf. Enomoto 1989a; cf. also SHT VIII
1879 (p. 69).
103 [[MN148]] at MN III 283,10: ta�hā attā ti and D (4094) mngon pa, ju 159b6 or Q (5595) tu 184b4: sred

105 D (4094) mngon pa, ju 160a5 or Q (5595) tu 185a3. The absence of any reference to this treatment in
[[SA325]] thus appears be a case of textual loss, in fact the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya refers to a statement
from the present discourse that examines precisely the relationship of the three types of feeling to their
underlying tendencies, Abhidh-k 5:2 in Pradhan 1967 279,1: yattarhi sūtre kleśa evānuśaya ukta� �a��a�ke so ’sya bhavati sukhāyā� vedanāyā� rāgānuśaya’ iti, paralleling [[MN148]] at MN III 285,6; cf.

sition by indicating that contemplation of the not-self nature of all aspects of sense-experience, up to the three types of feeling, leads to Nirvā�a. It thereby parallels the
exposition found at the end of the Sa�yukta-āgama discourse.

MN III 287  The Chachakka-sutta and its parallels conclude with the delight of the monks. The
Pāli version notes that sixty monks reached the destruction of the influxes while listening to this exposition on the six sets of sixes. [106]


[[MN149]] Mahāsa�āyatanika-sutta107

The Mahāsa�āyatanika-sutta, the “discourse on the great six sense-spheres”, gives a
short but penetrative instruction on the development of insight in regard to the six sensespheres. This discourse has a parallel in the Sa�yukta-āgama, [108] as well as in a discourse
quotation in Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya, extant in Tibetan. [109]

MN III 287   The Mahāsa�āyatanika-sutta and its parallels offer a closely similar exposition on the
six sense-spheres, which highlights how lack of proper vision and knowledge in regard
to the six senses, their objects, consciousness, contact, and the three types of feeling
leads to the arising of lust, and therewith to the continuation of the five aggregates, to
future rebirth, and to bodily and mental affliction. [110]

107 Se-MN III 521,1 gives the discourse’s title as Sa�āyatanavibha�ga-sutta. Thus, the Siamese edition has
two discourses with this title, the present discourse and [[MN137]] [[MN149]] at MN III 287,13 introduces
the theme of the exposition with the Buddha announcing that he will teach “the great six sense-spheres”,
mahāsa�āyatanika� ... desissāmi (B [e] -MN III 335,11: desessāmi), which would have made this expression an obvious choice for the title. Ps V 103,7 explains that mahā qualifies the six sense-spheres, mahāsa�āyantikan ti mahantāna� channa� āyatanāna� jotaka� dhammapariyāya�. According to [[SA305]] at T II 87b1, the Buddha began his exposition by announcing that he would teach a “discourse on
the six analyses of the six sense-spheres”,, a term that recurs again at the conclusion
of [[SA305]] at T II 87c15. Comparing this title to the Pāli titles suggests the possibility that could be a
scribal error for, on which assumption the title would have been “discourse on the great analysis of
the six sense-spheres”, . In fact, the corresponding part in the Tibetan version employs
“six” only once, D (4094) mngon pa, ju 203b2 or Q (5595) tu 232a7: skye mched drug gi tshogs zhes
bya ba’i chos kyi rnam grangs, confirming the impression that the doubling of the “six” could be the
result of a scribal error.
108 The parallel is [[SA305]] at T II 87a-c. While [[MN149]] takes place in Jeta’s Grove, [[SA305]] and Abhidh-k
       - have Kammāsadhamma in the Kuru country as their venue.

110 [[SA305]] differs from the standard sequence of enumerating the three types of feeling, as it begins with 大分別六入處經
“painful” feeling,, followed by “pleasant” feeling,, and then “neither-painful-nor-pleasant” feeling, . The same sequence can be found in several other discourses in the Sa�yukta-āgama, cf.

The Chinese and Tibetan versions additionally point out that in this way birth, old
age, disease, and death arise, as well as the whole great mass of dukkha. [111] The three
versions continue by applying the same treatment to the complementary case when
vision and knowledge are present, whereby the arising of lust and all its detrimental repercussions can be avoided.

and [[SA1166]] at T II 311c1. Yet, other discourses in the same Sa�yukta-āgama collection adopt the sequence found in the Pāli discourses (and also in the Abhidh-k-� parallel to the present discourse, [[SA305]] cf. D (4094) mngon pa, ju 203b4 or Q (5595) tu 232a8), which begins with pleasant feelings, cf.
[[SA471]] at T II 120b19, [[SA473]] at T II 121a4, [[SA474]] at T II 121a21, [[SA475]] at T II 121c2, [[SA476]] at T

and [[SA1164]] at T II 310c7. Some discourses in the Sa�yukta-āgama have both patterns, as [[SA470]] at T
II 120a1, [[SA467]] at T II 119a27, [[SA468]] at T II 119b15, [[SA472]] at T II 120c12, and [[SA969]] at T II
249c10 begin with painful feelings, but then the same discourses [[SA470]] at T II 120b2, [[SA467]] at T II
119a29, [[SA468]] at T II 119b16, [[SA472]] at T II 120c12, and [[SA969]] at T II 249c20 continue by mentioning pleasant feelings first. It is noteworthy that within a single discourse collection variations should
occur in the case of such an elementary aspect of the teachings as the three types of feeling, since from
the perspective of the dynamics of transmission it would be natural for the reciters to adopt the same
sequence throughout, and it is difficult to conceive of a cogent reason why they should have adopted
different sequences. This is, however, not the only instance of such unexpected variations in the Sa�yukta-āgama. Another example of a similar type is when the name Ko��añña is rendered in two different ways ( and ) within the same discourse, cf. [[SA379]] at T II 104a10:

. Another case is [[SA551]] at T II 144b4, which presents a stanza, follows this stanza with an explanation, and then concludes by repeating the stanza that has just been explained (T II 144c13). This repetition, however, differs considerably from the earlier stanza, as its first line reads, instead
of, the third line speaks of, instead of, and the final line is quite different, cf.
, whereas earlier the final line reads . These instances
might be examples of a tendency described by Zürcher 1991: 288, where in early translations “there is
a strong tendency to avoid the monotonous effect of ... verbatim repetition ... by introducing a certain
amount of diversification and irregularity”, as a result of which “in the same translated scripture we
often find various alternative forms and longer or shorter versions of the same clich 憍陳如 拘隣 世尊告尊者憍陳如, é”. Relevant to the
知法未? same topic 憍陳如白佛, would also be 已知, one of 世尊. the maxims 復告尊者憍陳如, set up for correct 知法未? translation 拘隣白佛, attributed 已知, 善逝. 尊者拘隣已知 to Dàoān ( ) in T
2145 at T LV 52b 法故 26, cf. also Bingenheimer 2010: 25 and Meier 1972: 43, which emphasizes the, for
the early Chinese translators apparently not self-evident, importance of respecting the repetitive nature
of the Indian texts. 若斷一切流

842   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


MN III 289  The Mahāsa�āyatanika-sutta and its parallels continue in similar ways by showing
how one with such knowledge and vision is endowed with the following path factors:

       - right view,

       - right intention,

       - right effort,

       - right mindfulness,

       - right concentration.
The other three path factors should be understood to have been developed earlier. [112]
Practising the noble eightfold path in this way then leads to developing:

       - the four satipa��hānas,

       - the four right efforts,

       - the four ways to [psychic] power,

       - the five faculties,

       - the five powers,

       - the seven factors of awakening.
The Pāli and Tibetan versions add to this listing that, by practising in this way, tranquillity and insight come into being concurrently. [113]
The Mahāsa�āyatanika-sutta and its parallels continue by examining four aspects of
penetrative insight, though they differ in the sequence of their presentation (see table
15.3). [114] The sequence adopted in the Chinese and Tibetan versions conforms to the
pattern set by the standard formulation of the four noble truths.

112 Abhidh-k-� differs, as it includes right speech among the factors that are developed by knowledge and
vision, D (4094) mngon pa, ju 205a2 or Q (5595) tu 234a1, so that, in its presentation, only right action
and right livelihood have been developed earlier. A minor difference between the other two versions is
that [[SA305]] at T II 87c1 lists the factors developed earlier as “right speech, right action, right livelihood”,
, whereas [[MN149]] at MN III 289,7 adopts a different sequence by listing “bodily action, verbal action, and livelihood”, kāyakamma� vacīkamma� ājīvo. A quotation of the present passage in the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya, Abhidh-k 4:4 in Pradhan 1967: 196,23, agrees in sequence with
[[SA305]] samyak vākkarmāntājīvā�, T 1558 at T XXIX 69a22:, and T 1559 at T XXIX 226c28:
, a sequence also adopted in the commentarial gloss at Ps V 103,23: vācākammantājīvā.
From the perspective of oral recitation, a result of the departure from the usual sequence in [[MN149]] by
listing kāyakamma� vacīkamma� ājīvo is that the final two words produce assonance through the long
-ī- in second position (the first two words are anyway related through homoioteleuton by sharing the
same ºkamma� as their second part), whereas to recite vacīkamma� kāyakamma� ājīvo, a sequence
that would accord with the standard listings of the corresponding factors of the noble eightfold path,
正語, would not produce such an assonance. It seems, however, less probable that this would have influenced 正業, 正命
the sequence of the terms, since usually the influence of assonance or of the principle of waxing syllables on listings is overruled by doctrinal requirements, which would be the case for the sequence of the
factors of the noble eightfold path; cf. also Anālayo 2009v. 正語業命
113 [[MN149]] at MN III 289, 正語正業正命 16 and D (4094) mngon pa, ju 205a4 or Q (5595) tu 234a4. On samatha and vipassanā undertaken in conjunction cf. also [[AN4.170]] at AN II 157,15, the Śrāvakabhūmi in Shukla 1973:
404,4 or ŚSG 2010: 26,3, with the Chinese counterpart in T 1579 at T XXX 458b4, and Anālayo 2009z.
114 [[MN149]] at MN III 289,20, [[SA305]] at T II 87c5, and D (4094) mngon pa, ju 205a5 or Q (5595) tu 234a6.
The same four aspects of the development of penetrative insight recur – in the sequence adopted by [[SA305]] and Abhidh-k-� – in the Dhammacakkapavattana-sutta, [[SN56.11]] at SN V 422,6, which proceeds


Chapter 15 Sa�āyatana-vagga                                     -  843


Table 15.3: Four Aspects of Insight in [[MN149]] and its Parallels

|[[MN149]]|[[SA305]] & Abhidh-k-I|
|---|---|
|full understanding (1)<br>abandoning (2)<br>development (3)<br>realization (4)|full understanding (→ 1)<br>abandoning (→ 2)<br>realization (→ 4)<br>development (→ 3)|



The Pāli discourse explains that the five aggregates [affected by] clinging are to be
fully understood, whereas according to the Chinese and Tibetan presentation nameand-form should be fully understood. [115] The three versions agree that ignorance and
craving for becoming need to be abandoned, while knowledge and liberation need to be
realized. According to the Pāli and Tibetan versions, tranquillity and insight should be
developed, whereas the Sa�yukta-āgama discourse only takes insight into account. [116]
The Chinese and Tibetan discourses conclude that a monk, who has accomplished
these four aspects of penetrative insight, can be reckoned as having eradicated craving
and gone beyond dukkha. [117]


[[MN150]] Nagaravindeyya-sutta

The Nagaravindeyya-sutta, the “discourse to those from Nagaravinda”, sets forth what
makes a recluse or a Brahmin worthy of veneration. This discourse has a parallel in the
Sa�yukta-āgama. [118] Parts of the Nagaravindeyya-sutta have also been preserved in Sanskrit fragments. [119]
The Nagaravindeyya-sutta and its Sa�yukta-āgama parallel begin by relating that the
Brahmin householders of Nagaravinda had come to visit the Buddha. While the Sa�yukta-āgama simply explains that they had come because they had heard about the Bud

from what is to be “fully understood”, pariññeyya�, via what is to be “abandoned”, pahātabba�, and
what is to be “realized”, sacchikātabba�, to what is to be “developed”, bhāvetabba� (for a survey of
some parallel versions that show the same pattern cf. Chung 2006). The sequence in [[MN149]] together
with the corresponding explanation, recurs as a discourse on its own in [[AN8.42]] at AN II 246-247.

dha’s arrival in the vicinity of their village, the Majjhima-nikāya version describes in
detail the good report about the Buddha and his teaching that had motivated the householders to come for a visit. The Sanskrit fragments have preserved part of this good report,
indicating that the Sanskrit version was in this respect similar to the Pāli discourse. [120]
Another correspondence between the Sanskrit fragments and the Pāli version can be
found in relation to their description of the behaviour of the Brahmin householders on
arriving at the Buddha’s presence. While the Sa�yukta-āgama version simply notes
that they bowed at his feet and sat down, [121] the Pāli version describes a set of different
behaviour patterns, with some visitors paying homage to the Buddha, while others exchange greetings, or even just sit down silently. The Sanskrit fragments have preserved
part of a description of these behaviour variations, shown by the Buddha’s visitors. [122]
This is noteworthy in so far as these Sanskrit fragments belong to a set of fragments
that have preserved a whole series of discourses whose sequence corresponds closely
to this section of the Sa�yukta-āgama. [123] Variations in the order in which discourses
are placed within a Nikāya or Āgama are usually characteristic of different reciter traditions. Thus, judging from this similarity in the sequence of a whole series of discourses,
the Sanskrit parallel to the Nagaravindeyya-sutta should belong to a reciter tradition
closely related to the reciter tradition whose Sa�yukta-āgama version was eventually
translated into Chinese. [124]
According to the Nagaravindeyya-sutta and its Sa�yukta-āgama parallel, the Buddha
told his visitors how they should reply on being asked what kinds of recluse or Brahmin are not worthy of veneration. A minor difference between the two versions is that,
according to the Majjhima-nikāya version, those who might put such an inquiry to the
householders of Nagaravinda are heterodox wanderers, while the Sa�yukta-āgama discourse attributes such a hypothetical inquiry simply to other people. [125]

their head at his feet, and stepped back to sit on one side”, .

123 SHT VI 1226 folios 1-24 (pp. 19-34) have preserved counterparts to [[SA273-]][[SA282]] The last line of
the fragment parallel to the present discourse, SHT VI 1226 folio 18Rg, has preserved parts of the location given for [[SA281]] at T II 77a29, thereby confirming the sequence.
124 For a similar case cf. Waldschmidt 1957/1967: 291 note 2.

say”, . The Pāli version’s reference to heterodox wanderers is to some extent unexpected,
as there seems to be no need to bring in the followers of other sects in a situation where a group of 詣世尊所, 稽首禮足, 退坐一面
householders has approached the Buddha in order to hear a discourse, all the more in view of the behaviour variations exhibited by the visitors according to the Pāli account, which depicts an audience of
which a considerable part did apparently not consider themselves disciples of the Buddha. In other dis若人問汝言


Chapter 15 Sa�āyatana-vagga                                     -  845


The Nagaravindeyya-sutta and its Sa�yukta-āgama counterpart agree that recluses
and Brahmins who are still under the sway of lust in regard to experiences by way of
the six senses should not be honoured. The two versions explain that such recluses and
Brahmins are not worthy of respect and honour, since they are not superior to householders. [126] Both versions apply their treatment to the opposite case of recluses and Brahmins that are aloof in regard to experiences through the six senses and thus worthy of
honour and worship.
The two versions reckon a secluded way of life to be a good reason for assuming that
a recluse or Brahmin is either free from lust or else is engaging in the practice that
leads to such freedom, since objects of the senses that have the potential to arouse lust
are not found in secluded dwelling places. The Sa�yukta-āgama version explains that
the sense objects absent from secluded dwelling places are in particular those related to


courses, instructions on how to properly answer heterodox wanderers are almost always given to Buddhist monks, in order to prepare them to stand their ground in a debate situation, cf., e.g., [[DN29]] at DN
III 130,21, [[MN11]] at MN I 64,2, [[MN59]] at MN I 400,15 (= [[SN36.19]] at SN IV 228,13), [[SN35.151]] at
SN IV 138,5, [[SN36.20]] at SN IV 229,11, [[SN45.41-48]] at SN V 27-29, [[SN54.11]] at SN V 326,3 (= [[SN54.12]] at SN V 328,14), [[AN3.68]] at AN I 199,16, [[AN8.83]] at AN IV 338,9, [[AN9.1]] at AN IV 351,9, and
[[AN10.58]] at AN V 106,12. In [[DN8]] at DN I 175,1, such instructions are given to a heterodox wanderer
shortly before he declares his wish to go forth as a Buddhist monk. Several discourses report that such
encounters had already happened and the monks went back to the Buddha in order to learn how to answer such questions in the future, cf., e.g., [[MN13]] at MN I 85,12 and [[SN22.86]] at SN III 118,9 (= [[SN44.2]] at SN IV 382,8), [[SN35.81]] at SN IV 51,17, [[SN45.5]] at SN V 7,8, [[SN46.52]] at SN V 109,21, [[SN46.54]] at SN V 118,20, and [[AN10.27]] at AN V 50,6. In contrast to such occurrences, it is not clear why
the Buddha should feel a need to teach the householders of Nagaravinda, who apparently had not yet
become even his lay disciples, how to reply to questions posed by followers of other sects. From this
perspective, the reference to people in general in [[SA280]] fits the context better, since to discuss who
should be venerated and who should not be venerated could well have been a topic of conversation
among laity in general.
126 [[MN150]] at MN III 291,18 describes such recluses and Brahmins as not being free from lust, anger, or
delusion, avītarāgā avītadosā avītamohā; [[SA280]] at T II 76c11 speaks of them not being free from lust,
desires, craving, thirst, and thoughts,, without mentioning
anger or delusion. [[SA280]] at T II 76c26 uses the same set of qualities in its positive mode when describing recluses and Brahmins that are worthy of respect and honour. Only when describing the solitary life
style of these recluses and Brahmins does [[SA280]] at T II 77a12 also mention their freedom from anger
and delusion, (a description which in [[MN150]] and in [[SA280]] only mentions the
five senses, whereas earlier both versions took up all six senses). This might be a remnant of a presentation similar to [[MN150]] since the reference to lust, anger and delusion comes up first as part of a question asked by others in reply to the earlier exposition, where it would be natural for the question to employ the terms earlier used, instead of switching, without any apparent reason, from an earlier reference
to lust and craving, etc., to speaking of lust, anger and delusion. The corresponding parts in the Sanskrit
fragments have preserved several expressions that point to a more detailed treatment, similar in this re 未離貪, 未離欲, 未離愛, 未離渴, 未離念  spect to the presentation in [[SA280]] such as, e.g., SHT VI 1226 folio 16Vd: avigatar[ā](ga) (cf. also
SHT X 3270+4060V3), folio 16Re: (a)vigatacchanda (cf. also SHT X 3273R1+3), folio 15Rf: avigatasnehā and folio 16 Vb: avigatapi(pāsa) (cf. also SHT X 3270+4060R4), and SHT X 3270+4060R2:

[t](�)��ā aviga[t](a)[pre]mā 離貪 ... 離恚 ... . Notably, SHT VI 1226 folio 18V 離癡 c has also preserved a reference to vigatamoha.

association with women, [127] a way of understanding the implications of the present passage also reflected in the Pāli commentary. [128]
According to the Nagaravindeyya-sutta and its Sa�yukta-āgama parallel, the householders expressed their appreciation for the Buddha’s exposition by comparing his
teachings to revealing something that was hidden, showing the path to someone who
was lost, and holding up a lamp in the dark. [129] Before delivering this set of similes,
found regularly in the discourses on such occasions, according to the Sa�yukta-āgama
account the householders remarked that the Buddha had given a teaching without praising himself or disparaging others. [130]
The Pāli version concludes by reporting that the householders took refuge as lay followers. Although the Chinese version does not record that the householders took refuge, the Sanskrit fragments appear to agree with the Pāli account, as the concluding
section of the Sanskrit version has preserved part of the formulaic expression used to
take refuge. [131]


[[MN151]] Pi��apātapārisuddhi-sutta

The Pi��apātapārisuddhi-sutta, the “discourse on purity [when receiving] alms food”,
describes the development of mental purity while collecting alms. This discourse has a
parallel in the Sa�yukta-āgama. [132]

127 [[SA280]] at T II 77a14 describes how “staying in empty places, at the foot of a tree in a forest, sitting on
a low seat of grass, they practise seclusion, keeping away from association with women, they delight in
being alone, with their thought collected in meditation”,
, followed by explaining that in such places “there are no forms to be
seen by the eye that could arouse delight and attachment”,, a statement then applied to the other sense-doors.
128 Ps V 105,10, in its gloss on living in seclusion, explains that, although in seclusion there are pleasurable
objects of the senses, what the discourse’s description intends is the absence of sense objects related to
women, itthirūpādīni pana sandhāy’ eta� kathita�.
129 [[SA280]] at T II 77a24 differs in regard to the first simile, where it speaks of rescuing someone who is
drowning, whereas [[MN150]] at MN III 293,23 describes setting up what had been overthrown.
130 [[SA280]] at T II 77a21: . According to [[SA280]] at T II 77a23, the householders also remarked that the Buddha had extensively taught them dependent arising, 在空閑處, 林中樹下, 卑床草蓐,, a remark that per- 修行遠離,
離諸女人近, haps refers to his clarification of the reasons that make someone worthy of respect and worship (SHT 樂獨人, 同禪思者
VI 1226 folio 18Re has preserved pratītya, which might reflect a similar statement). A curiosity in this 無眼見色可生樂著
part of [[SA280]] at T II 77a20 is that the speakers are not only the “Brahmin householders”, but also the
“recluses”,, which seems to confound the “recluses and Brahmins” that were the topic of the discourse and the “Brahmin householders” that were listening to the discourse.
131 SHT VI 1226 folio 18Rf: (dha)rmañ-ca bhik�usa�gha(ñ-ca).
132 The parallel is [[SA236]] at T II 57b, which has the title “dwelling in purity when begging food”,
(a title given at T II 57b25). [[SA236]] takes place at Jeta’s Grove by Sāvatthī, whereas [[MN151]] has
Rājagaha as its venue. [[SA236]] has been translated in Choong 2004: 5-9, for remarks on [[SA236]] in the 不自譽, 不毀他
light of [[MN151]] cf. Choong 1999: 11-13. The first part of [[MN151]] also has a partial parallel in [[EA45.6]] 廣說緣起
at T II 773b. In close agreement with [[MN151]] [[EA45.6]] reports that Sāriputta arose from seclusion and
visited the Buddha, who inquired about Sāriputta’s pure faculties. [[EA45.6]] also agrees with [[MN151]]

The Pi��apātapārisuddhi-sutta and its Sa�yukta-āgama parallel begin by narrating
that Sāriputta had come to the presence of the Buddha after having practised emptiness
meditation, [133] a form of meditation the Buddha commended. [134]
According to both versions, the Buddha explained that, in order to relate dwelling in
emptiness to going to beg alms food, a monk should examine if anything he had seen
while going for alms or returning had caused the arising of desire in him. [135] The Majjhima-nikāya version continues by applying the same treatment to the other sensedoors, whereas the Sa�yukta-āgama version only takes up the case of visual forms. [136]
According to both versions, if on examination the monk finds out that unwholesome
states have arisen in his mind, he should make a firm effort to overcome them. The
Sa�yukta-āgama version illustrates this effort with the image of a man whose head is
on fire, a situation where this man would make an utmost effort to extinguish that fire. [137]
If a monk finds that his mind remained unaffected by unwholesome states, then he may
dwell happily and continue to train himself day and night with energy and mindfulness.
The Sa�yukta-āgama discourse continues by indicating that to dwell happily in this
way, free from defilements, and to train in wholesomeness while walking, standing,
sitting, and lying down is the way to develop purity in regard to begging for food. [138]


that Sāriputta informed the Buddha about his practice of emptiness meditation and that the Buddha
praised such meditation. From this point onwards, [[EA45.6]] continues differently, as according to its report the Buddha followed up the topic of the superiority of emptiness meditation by describing his own
pre-awakening experiences. Thus, the remainder of [[EA45.6]] is no longer a parallel to [[MN151]]
133 A minor difference between the two versions is that [[SA236]] at T II 57b5 describes how Sāriputta went
to beg alms before retiring into seclusion to meditate, a circumstance not mentioned in [[MN151]] Another
difference is that, while according to [[MN151]] at MN II 294,1 the Buddha inquired after the purity of
Sāriputta’s faculties, according to [[SA236]] at T II 57b8 the Buddha asked Sāriputta where he had come
from,, and on being told that Sāriputta had come from his daily abiding in meditation in the
forest, the Buddha asked Sāriputta what meditation he had been practising, ? In both cases,
[[EA45.6]] at T II 773b21+23 agrees with [[MN151]] On the positive implications of the reference to dwelling in emptiness in the present context cf. also Pāsādika 2008b: 144-145.
134 While according to [[MN151]] at MN III 294,6 the Buddha qualified such meditation as the “dwelling of
great men”, mahāpurisavihāra, according to [[SA236]] at T II 57b13 he spoke of it as the “dwelling of
elders”, (the earlier at T II 57b12 should be emended accordingly; cf. also Choong 2004: 7
note 5).
135 While [[MN151]] at MN III 294,15 takes up the possible arising of “desire”, chanda, “lust”, rāga, “anger”, dosa, “delusion”, moha, and “irritation”, pa�igha, [[SA236]] at T II 57b15 speaks of “desire”,,
“affection 汝從何來 ”,, “thoughts of craving”,, and “attachment”, ; on this passage cf. also Baums
2009: 353. For a similar variation between a Majjhima-nikāya listing of unwholesome mental factors 入何等禪住
and its Sa�yukta-āgama counterpart cf. above p. 845 note 126.
136 Here the treatment in [[MN151]] seems more complete, since while walking for alms a monk may well
come across sounds, odours, or even tangibles that could provoke unwholesome reactions in him.
137 [[SA236]] at T II 57b18. The same simile recurs in [[AN4.93]] at AN II 93,18 and [[AN10.54]] at AN V 99,27
to illustrate the need to develop 上座 上坐 samatha and vipassanā, as well as in [[AN6.20]] at AN III 307,11, [[AN8.74]] at AN IV 321,27, [[AN10.51]] at AN V 93,25, [[AN10.52]] at AN V 95,20, [[AN10.53]] at AN V 98,3,
and [[AN10.55]] at AN V 104,22 to illustrate the making of an effort to overcome unwholesome states.

848   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


After having in this way clarified in what way a monk can become a pure recipient of
alms food, in the sense of becoming a worthy recipient, [139] the Sa�yukta-āgama discourse concludes with the delighted reaction of Sāriputta after having heard this exposition from the Buddha.

MN III 295  The Majjhima-nikāya version, however, continues by bringing up a whole range of
other topics, as it mentions:

       - overcoming the five types of sensual pleasure,

       - overcoming the five hindrances,

       - understanding the five aggregates [affected by] clinging,

       - developing the four satipa��hānas,

       - developing the four right efforts,

       - developing the four ways to [psychic] power,

       - developing the five faculties,

       - developing the five powers,

       - developing the seven factors of awakening,

       - developing the eightfold noble path,

       - developing tranquillity and insight,

       - realizing knowledge and liberation. [140]
The Majjhima-nikāya version concludes by explaining that recluses and Brahmins of
past, present, and future times have, do, and will develop purity in regard to receiving
alms food by undertaking all these practices.
Since this entire presentation is absent from the Sa�yukta-āgama version, and since
it also does not seem to be indispensable from the viewpoint of the basic theme of the
discourse, [141] one might wonder how far the presentation in the Majjhima-nikāya version
could be the outcome of a later expansion of an originally shorter exposition, similar to
the cases of the Mahārāhulovāda-sutta and the Mahāsakuludāyi-sutta. [142]

in wholesomeness by proclaiming that “this is reckoned a monk [who] while walking, standing, sitting,
and lying down has purity [in regard to] begging food”, .
139 According to the examination of the purification of offerings given in [[MN142]] at MN III 256,14 and in
its parallels [[MA180]] at T I 722b27 and T 84 at T I 904a23, an offering can be purified by the giver or by
the recipient. Applying this principle to the present case, by overcoming unwholesome states of mind
and training in wholesomeness a monk becomes a worthy recipient of offerings and does what is required in order to ensure that the alms given to him will be fruitful for the giver.
140 This exposition ranges from [[MN151]] at MN III 295,13 to MN III 297,20.
141 Although the development of all these aspects of the Buddhist path to liberation would certainly be
most desirable in order to maximise the merits accrued by the donor of any alms food to such a monk,
to fulfil the entire set of requirements mentioned in [[MN151]] would necessitate becoming an arahant.
Judging from the titles of the Pi��apātapārisuddhi-sutta 是名比丘於行, and its Sa�yukta-āgama 住, 坐, 臥, parallel, the issue of 淨除乞食
being pure when receiving alms food is the basic topic of both versions, a purification that could already
take place at levels of development that fall short of full awakening and that have not yet done full justice to the whole range of practices mentioned in [[MN151]] For a monk who wishes to be a pure recipient of alms food, the stipulations given in [[SA236]] seem quite adequate and sufficient.
142 Cf. above pp. 348 and 423, an extract from the present discussion already appeared in Anālayo 2005c:
96-97.

[[MN152]] Indriyabhāvanā-sutta

The Indriyabhāvanā-sutta, the “discourse on the development of the faculties”, describes the development of self-control in regard to sensory experience. This discourse
has a parallel in the Sa�yukta-āgama. [143] Parts of this discourse have also been preserved in Sanskrit fragments. [144]
The Indriyabhāvanā-sutta and its Sa�yukta-āgama parallel report in similar ways
that the Brahmin youth Uttara, on being asked how he had been instructed in regard to
the development of the faculties, explained that his teacher recommended to avoid seeing forms with the eye and hearing sounds with the ear. In both versions, this proposal
meets with the rebuttal that in this case the blind and deaf would be accomplished practitioners. [145] Following a request by Ānanda, the Buddha then expounded his approach
to the development of the faculties. In both discourses, this approach covers three aspects, although the two versions present these three aspects in a different sequence and
under different headings.
The first of these three aspects in the Majjhima-nikāya version is the “supreme development of the faculties”, [146] which depicts how to establish equanimity in regard to sense


143 The parallel is [[SA282]] at T II 78a-79a, for which Akanuma 1929/1990: 44 gives “developing the faculties”,, as a title. [[SA282]] has as its location, counterpart to the location
given in [[MN152]] at MN III 298,1 as the Mukhelu Grove at Kaja�gala, with B [e] -MN III 347,25 speaking
of the Suve�u Grove at Gaja�gala, C [e] -MN III 616,2 of the Mūkhelu Grove at Kaja�gala, and S [e] -MN III
541,3 of a ve�uvane (bamboo grove) at Kajja�gala (a bamboo grove at Kaja�gala is the location for [[AN10.28]] at AN V 54,20). SHT VI 1226 folio 22Vc has preserved parts of a reference to the location of the
present discourse as i[�ga]lāyā[m]. An Avadānaśataka tale in Speyer 1909/1970: 41,5 or in Vaidya
1958a: 192,10, which otherwise is not related to the present discourse, has a vana�a��a by Kaca�galā
as its location. According to Vin I 197,21, Kaja�gala formed the eastern boundary of the Middle Country.
144 The Sanskrit fragment is SHT VI 1226 folio 22Vc to 24Vc (pp. 33-34), which has preserved several
short parts of the whole discourse.
145 Whereas in [[MN152]] at MN III 298, 諸根修 17 迦微伽羅, the Buddha mentioned the blind and the deaf, 牟真隣陀林 andho and badhiro, according to [[SA282]] at T II 78b1 he only referred to someone who is blind,, while the case of
someone who is deaf,, was according to [[SA282]] at T II 78b4 brought up by Ānanda. Another difference is that [[MN152]] at MN III 298,21 describes Uttara’s silent dismay on hearing the Buddha’s reply, a reaction not recorded in [[SA282]] The introductory narration in [[MN152]] and [[SA282]] recurs as a
discourse quotation in the Vibhā�ā translations, which agree with [[SA282]] that the remark about the deaf
was made by Ānanda cf. T 1545 at T XXVII 729b6, T 1546 at T XXVIII 271a18, and T 1547 at T XXVIII
439c19. Bronkhorst 1993/2000: x and id. 1999: 86 sees a contradiction between this criticism of the
“development of the faculties” through avoiding sights and sounds, proposed by Uttara’s teacher, and
the approving attitude shown in other discourses towards deeper states of concentration during which
sights or sounds are no longer experienced, e.g., in [[DN16]] at DN II 131,20. Yet, the point made in the
present discourse is how to relate to everyday experience, in fact the expression 盲者 “development of the
faculties”, indriyabhāvanā 聾者, is an obvious counterpart to “restraint of the faculties”, indriyasa�vara.
Thus, the present passage is not a criticism of deeper stages of concentration during which sensory experience is absent, but rather a criticism of attempting to deal with sensory impact during daily life by
simply trying to avoid it, instead of developing equanimity towards whatever is experienced. For a critical review of Bronkhorst’s argument regarding [[MN152]] cf. also Pāsādika 2009: 92-93.

experience that is agreeable, disagreeable, and both agreeable and disagreeable. [147] In
each case, one should know that such experiences are conditioned and gross, whereas
equanimity is refined and peaceful. The Majjhima-nikāya version applies the same to
each of the six senses and depicts this way of handling experience at each sense-door
with a set of similes. These similes illustrate the swift establishment of equanimity at
each sense-door in the following manner:

 - eye sense-door: opening and closing one’s eyes at will,

 - ear sense-door: snapping one’s fingers,

 - nose sense-door: water drops roll off a lotus leaf,

 - tongue sense-door: spitting out spittle,

 - body sense-door: flexing or stretching one’s arm,

 - mind sense-door: water drops fall onto a heated plate and evaporate quickly.
The Sa�yukta-āgama version has a similar treatment as its second topic (see table
15.4), although it introduces this under the heading of being a “noble one with developed faculties”. [148] The Sa�yukta-āgama version’s presentation also differs in its use of
the image of water drops that fall into a heated pan, as it employs this simile to illustrate the establishment of equanimity at the body sense-door, while the Majjhima-nikāya version applies the same simile to the mind sense-door. [149] In the case of establish

147 A counterpart to this instruction on equanimity in regard to pleasant or unpleasant experiences can be
found in the Jain Āyāra�ga 2.15.5.1, which instructs to avoid being attached to or developing any desire towards agreeable or disagreeable sense experiences, Watanabe 2002/2003: 144: sote�a� jīve
ma�u��āma�u��āi� saddāi� su�ei, ma�u��āma�u��ehi� saddehi� no sejjā, no rajjejjā, no gijjhejjā,
no mujjhejjā, no ajjhovajjejjā, no vi�igghaya� āvajjejjā (Jacobi 1882: 136,6 reads sotae�a�, ma�unnāma�unnāi�, ma�unnāma�unnehi� and sejjejjā), translated by Jacobi 1884/1996: 208 as: “if a creature with ears hears agreeable and disagreeable sounds, it should not be attached to, nor delighted with,
nor desiring of, nor infatuated by, nor covetous of, nor disturbed by the agreeable or disagreeable
sounds”. The text continues by pointing out that, given that it is not possible to avoid hearing sounds, a
monk should avoid desire or aversion towards them, na sakkā na sou� saddā soyavisaya� āgatā, rāgadosā u je tattha ta� bhikkhu parivajjae. Watanabe 2002/2003: 144 notes that the title of this treatment is
bhāva�a. Compared to [[MN152]] a difference is that the Jain text begins its treatment with what is heard
through the ear, before turning to what is seen through the eye, what is smelled through the nose, what
is tasted through the tongue, and what is felt through the body, a difference which is a recurrent feature
in Jain texts. McHugh 2007: 403 explains that this type of sequence probably reflects Jain cosmology,
whereas the Buddhist sequence appears to be based on an analysis of the nature of perception (based on
the relation between the perceiver and the perceived, the eye being given pride of place due to it being
the most far-reaching organ).
148 [[SA282]] at T II 78b21: . Another difference is that [[SA282]] in each case explicitly mentions the
type of consciousness that arises in regard to each of the six senses (e.g., the “eye-consciousness”,,
in [[SA282]] at T II 78b22).
149 The version of this simile in [[SA282]] at T II 78c26 does not refer to the person that drops the water. While
E [e] -MN III 300,20 speaks of a “man” in general, puriso, B [e] -MN III 350,21, C [e] -MN III 620,31, and S [e]  MN III 545,16 speak of a “strong man”, balavā puriso. Other occurrences of this simile in [[MN66]] at MN I
453,26 and [[SN35.203]] at SN IV 190,13 agree on speaking merely of a “man”, puriso. Since to let a few
water drops fall into a heated pan does not require a “strong” man, the expression balavā puriso might
stem from the preceding simile and could have been accidentally applied to the present instance in
賢聖修根

Chapter 15 Sa�āyatana-vagga                                     -  851


ing equanimity at the mind sense-door, the Sa�yukta-āgama instead uses the example
of beheading a Palmyra tree. [150]
The Majjhima-nikāya version’s use of the simile of water drops that fall onto a heated
pan to illustrate the establishment of equanimity at the mind sense-door recurs in the La�ukikopama-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel, both of which employ the same
image to illustrate the overcoming of thoughts of desire. [151]


Table 15.4: Development of the Faculties in [[MN152]] and its Parallel

|[[MN152]]|[[SA282]]|
|---|---|

The Majjhima-nikāya version next turns to the “the disciple in higher training, the
one on the path”, who becomes disgusted with experiencing sense experience as agreeable, as disagreeable, or as both agreeable and disagreeable. [152] The Sa�yukta-āgama
version has a similar treatment as the last of its three topics. [153]
The third and last topic in the Majjhima-nikāya version is to be a “noble one with
developed faculties”, which requires to be able to view the agreeable as disagreeable,
the disagreeable as agreeable, etc., and to go beyond what is agreeable or disagreeable
and dwell in equanimity. [154] The corresponding treatment in the Sa�yukta-āgama discourse is the first of the three topics taken up in this version, introduced under the
heading “supreme development of the faculties”. [155] The Sa�yukta-āgama version differs from the corresponding treatment in the Majjhima-nikāya discourse by having a


some Pāli editions. The image of pouring water on hot metal is also found in a simile in the Jain Viyāhapa��atti 6.1.4 in Lalwani 1974: 235,27.
150 [[SA282]] at T II 79a5. Another difference can be found in regard to the first simile in [[MN152]] at MN III
299,15, which illustrates the swift establishing of equanimity in regard to visual experiences with the
example of opening and closing one’s eyes. This simile does not seem to have been fully preserved in
[[SA282]] at T II 78b26, which only speaks of a strong man doing something in a short time, without indicating what this strong man does (according to a and variant reading, the strong man would
snap his fingers, an image used in both versions to illustrate equanimity at the ear sense-door). Another
minor difference is that while [[MN152]] at MN III 300,1 compares the swift establishing of equanimity
at the nose sense-door to water drops that roll off a lotus leaf, [[SA282]] at T II 78c11 speaks only of a
lotus leaf not being sullied by water.

Tathāgata as its subject and by working through a somewhat different pattern. [156] This
pattern is as follows:

 - repulsion towards pleasing objects,

 - no repulsion towards displeasing objects,

 - repulsion-and-no-repulsion towards pleasing-and-displeasing objects,

 - no-repulsion-and-repulsion towards displeasing-and-pleasing objects,

 - equanimity towards pleasing, displeasing, and pleasing-and-displeasing objects.
The Majjhima-nikāya version instead adopts the following pattern: [157]

 - no repulsion towards what is repulsive,

 - repulsion towards what is not repulsive,

 - no repulsion towards what is repulsive-and-not-repulsive,

 - repulsion towards what is repulsive-and-not-repulsive,

 - equanimity.
In sum, underlying the overall pattern of the Indriyabhāvanā-sutta a gradual build up
can be discerned, which proceeds through the following topics:

 - initial insight into the conditioned nature of sensory input experienced as agreeable and disagreeable,

 - disgust with this evaluative mode of experiencing sensory data of the disciple in
higher training,

 - full mastery of reactions in regard to sense-experience by an accomplished one
who has fully developed the faculties. [158]
The pattern in the Sa�yukta-āgama version instead does not seem to have such an
underlying progression, as its main steps are, in brief:

 - the stage of the Tathāgata,

 - the development of the faculties,

 - the disgust with sense-experience of the disciple in higher training. [159]
From the viewpoint of textual transmission it is noteworthy that both versions begin
with the “supreme development of the faculties” as their first topic, although they differ on what type of treatment should be associated with this heading. While the Majjhima-nikāya version presents the set of similes illustrative of the establishment of equanimity at each sense-door under the “supreme development of the faculties”, the Sa�yukta-āgama version makes use of a similar set of similes when examining the “noble
one with developed faculties”. The “supreme development of the faculties” in the Sa�yukta-āgama discourse then resembles the Majjhima-nikāya version’s exposition of how
to be a “noble one with developed faculties”.

157 [[MN152]] at MN III 301,11.
158 This pattern would be in accordance with the analysis given in [[MN1]] at MN I 1,10 and [[EA44.6]] at T II
766a10 of the perceptual processes of different types of person, which similarly proceeds from the stage
of the worldling, via the disciple in higher training, to the aloofness in regard to all perceptual experience by an arahant or the Tathāgata.
159 Of the two modes of presentation, [[MN152]] seems to present a more consistent pattern.


Chapter 15 Sa�āyatana-vagga                                     -  853


Hence, although the two versions agree on beginning their overall treatment with the
same heading as the first of three topics, during the course of transmission a whole section has apparently been displaced within the discourse and been separated from its
original heading. In spite of this displacement, the presentation in both versions is similar, a treatment that both conclude with an emphatic exhortation by the Buddha to meditate and thereby put his exposition into practice.
Due to their similarities and differences, the Indriyabhāvanā-sutta and its Sa�yuktaāgama parallel in a way form a fitting conclusion to this series of comparative studies
of Majjhima-nikāya discourses and their parallels. Comparison of these two versions
shows that at least one of them has suffered from a substantial sequential alteration
during transmission. This alteration not only has caused a change in the overall sequence of presentation, but also resulted in associating the three main parts of the exposition with different headings. At the same time, in spite of their variations, the Indriyabhāvanā-sutta and its Sa�yukta-āgama parallel present closely similar teachings.


## Conclusion

In the present conclusion, I attempt to develop a perspective on the similarities and
differences found during my examination of the discourses of the Majjhima-nikāya in
the light of their parallels. This inevitably brings me back to the topic of oral transmission, already taken up in the introduction. While in the introduction I surveyed oral characteristics of the discourses, now I begin by studying the purposes and functions of oral
recitation in relation to those who undertook the transmission of the early discourses.
Next I take a closer look at the precision of textual memory in relation to the early Buddhist oral transmission. Then I examine the influence of commentarial notions and tales
on the transmission of the discourses.
In this way, I attempt to understand the dynamics responsible for the overall picture
that has resulted from my comparative study of the Majjhima-nikāya: the existence of
numerous variations between versions of a discourse preserved by different reciter lineages alongside a remarkable degree of similarity and correspondence.


The Purposes and Functions of Oral Recitation

According to the different Vinayas, soon after his awakening the Buddha sent his first
monk disciples out to teach others. [1] For these disciples to engage in teaching activities,
they would have needed to take some teachings along that they could use to explain the
Dharma, teachings they would then have passed on to their disciples. [2]
Such teachings can only have been in an oral form. [3] Some of the first monk disciples,
like Yasa and his friends, were not Brahmins trained in the art of oral transmission, so
the material they took along must have been relatively easy to memorize. Although the
discourses already delivered by that time would have been few, it may not be too far

3 Writing does not appear to have been in general use during the period in question. Allon 1997b: 39 notes
that neither the Pāli discourses nor the Vinaya refer to writing materials and there is no archaeological
evidence for the use of writing in India at the time of the Buddha. Von Hinüber 1989: 39, based on examining occurrences of √likh in the Pāli discourses and Vinaya, suggests that most of these could refer
only to “drawing” and concludes (p. 54) that there is no evidence for the use of writing before the third
century BC. Scharfe 2002: 12 explains that “the best evidence today is that no script was used or even
known in India before 300 B.C., except in the extreme Northwest that was under Persian dominion”; cf.
also Anālayo 2009w and Gombrich 1990b: 27-28.

fetched to suppose that, already at that time, some degree of formalization of these discourses had taken place, to facilitate their oral transmission. [4]
In fact, it could be that some oral features were already employed when the discourses
were first spoken, as would only be natural in an oral culture. [5] Even today repetition is
used as a tool to drive home a point when giving a speech, whereas such repetition is
avoided in a written presentation. Thus, some formalistic features to ensure that the listeners would keep the main points well in mind would have been integral to the discourses
when they were first delivered. [6] The formalization of the texts would then have continued in proportion to the growing amount of material to be memorized. Hence, in order
to satisfy the requirements of the expanding early Buddhist community, it seems probable that a body of oral material that was at least to some degree formalized had come
into existence during the Buddha’s lifetime.
Besides facilitating teaching and preaching, such a formalized body of oral material
would also have had the function of creating a sense of unity and communal concord
through group recitation. This function suggests itself from the Sa�gīti-sutta and its
parallels, which take their occasion from the need to ensure harmony in the face of
strife, something that according to this discourse had occurred among the Jains after
the death of their leader. [7]
The fortnightly recitation of the code of rules would have functioned (and still does
function) as just such a ritual manifestation of communal harmony. [8] The relevance of
group recitation in this respect can also be seen in the accounts of the so-called Bud
4 Davidson 1990/1992: 293 comments that the “processes of elaboration and consolidation must have
begun during the life of the Buddha”.
5 According to Ong 1982/1996: 34-36, “in an oral culture, experience is intellectualized mnemonically”.
“In a primary oral culture ... you have to do your thinking in mnemonic patterns, shaped for ready oral
recurrence. Your thought must come into being in heavily rhythmic, balanced patterns, in repetitions or
antitheses, in alliterations and assonances, in epithetic and other formulaic expressions”. Hence “in an
oral culture, to think through something in non-formulaic, non-patterned, non-mnemonic terms, even if it
were possible, would be a waste of time, for such thought, once worked through, could never be recovered with any effectiveness”. Hence Williams 1970: 166 may be quite right when he suggests that probably “the Buddha’s teaching methods included repetition and stylized formulae to aid memorization”.
6 The need to be conscious of the ability of the audience to preserve a teaching in mind is reflected in [[AN5.30]] at AN I 130,17, according to which problems that may arise when teaching the Dharma are not only
that some listeners do not pay attention, but also that, even though some do pay attention, on leaving they
quickly forget what they have heard. [[AN5.30]] at AN I 130,29 illustrates the case of a person who listens,
but then forgets it all again after leaving, with the example of someone who has different types of seed
on his lap and stands up quickly, as a result of which the seeds are all scattered around. In terms of this
simile, teachers in an oral setting would need to make sure that the ‘seeds’ they wish to sow in the minds
of their audience do not just get scattered and lost, as soon as they have concluded their teaching.

8 The importance attached to participation in such recitation is reflected in [[MN77]] at MN II 8,30 and its
parallel [[MA207]] at T I 783a16, which report that even those disciples who excelled in living in seclusion
would come for the fortnightly recitation of the code of rules; cf. also Vin I 105,26, according to which a
monk should come for the fortnightly recitation even if he is living apart.

dhist councils, which report that success in establishing communal harmony finds its
expression in the performance of group recital. [9]
In addition to functioning as a tool for the preservation of the teachings and for facilitating and expressing communal harmony, several passages indicate that oral recitation in early Buddhism had still other functions. A discourse in the Sa�yutta-nikāya
and its parallels in the two versions of the Sa�yukta-āgama report that once, just before dawn, Anuruddha was reciting by himself. [10] A woman overheard him and told her
child to be quiet, in order to avoid disturbing Anuruddha’s recitation. Another discourse
in the Sa�yutta-nikāya records that the Buddha similarly recited a discourse to himself
while being alone. [11] A monk chanced by and overheard the recitation.
The way the discourses depict the circumstances makes it clear that, in each of these
cases, the recitation should be understood to have been undertaken merely for its own
sake, without any teaching purpose in mind.
Whereas one might suppose that the point of the first instance could be that Anuruddha is shown to be rehearsing in private, it seems safe to assume that the discourses
would not present the Buddha as needing to rehearse his own teachings. In fact, what
he is reported to have recited on this occasion was an examination of the six senses
from the perspective of dependent arising, a topic that must have been familiar enough
to him not to require any private rehearsing. This suggests that when he is depicted as
undertaking such recitation, this is meant to be simply an act of recollecting the truth
he had discovered, perhaps similar to the inspired utterances that according to the Udāna collection he made soon after his awakening, a time when he was also alone and in
seclusion. [12]
The point made in the above passages would thus be that, from the perspective of the
reciters, the early Buddhist oral tradition also served as a way of meditating or reflecting
on the Dharma.
A list of five possible occasions for reaching liberation, given in several discourses,
conveys the same impression. According to this presentation, recitation can even issue
in awakening. [13] The discourses explain that during recitation a deeper understanding


9 Tilakaratne 2000a: 175-176 points out that “the fundamental purpose of the act of sa�gāyana and therefore of the events described as sa�gīti is the assurance of the unity of the Buddhist monastic organisation”, “in the act of sa�gāyana ... the key activity was to recite together”, “memorization or preservation
of the Canon ... was not its main purpose ... the act of sa�gāyana, first and foremost, was meant to be a
public expression of one’s allegiance to the organisation which was represented by the Dhamma and the
Vinaya”, “the recital of the Pātimokkha by the members of the Sa�gha every fortnight serves virtually
the same purpose”; cf. also Bareau 1955: 134. Witanachchi 2006b: 721 sums up that “what is relevant in
a sa�gīti is ... the absence of any discordance”.

can arise, which in turn leads to joy, tranquillity, and concentration, thereby establishing the necessary conditions for attaining liberation. [14] Thus, recitation undertaken for
its own sake was seen as a means of meditative development in a wider sense, and as
such could become a tool for progress on the path to liberation.
The discourses also suggest that listening to the oral delivery of a teaching can help
the listener to overcome a physical disease. One such instance is the Girimānanda-sutta. According to the Pāli and Tibetan versions of this discourse, the Buddha had told
Ānanda that he should recite a teaching on ten types of perception to a sick monk. The
monk is reported to have been so inspired on hearing these ten perceptions that he recovered from his illness. [15]
In this case, the point of the discourse could be that the sick monk found solace in
hearing teachings that were new to him. However, three discourses in the Sa�yuttanikāya depict situations where the ‘salutary’ effect of listening to a recitation involves
teachings that are clearly familiar to the respective hearers.
In two of these discourses, the Buddha recites the awakening factors to his disciples
Mahākassapa and Mahāmoggallāna, respectively, who on hearing this recitation recover their health. [16] In the third discourse, the Buddha is sick himself and another
monk recites the awakening factors for him. On hearing the recitation, the Buddha
recovers his health. [17]
Since Mahākassapa and Mahāmoggallāna are portrayed in the discourses as highly
accomplished eminent disciples, it can safely be assumed that the point of this presentation would not have been that they needed to be informed about the seven awakening
factors. Needless to say, the same applies for the Buddha himself. Thus, the significance


tion ... by chanting or listening to the rhythmic words of a sacred text, the teaching and inspiration in the
words becomes renewed and reinforced. In this sense the oral recitation of a text is a sacramental act”.
Von Hinüber 2009b: 156 highlights the different type of textual culture underlying early Buddhist oral
transmission, where the texts became part of life, “eine ganz andere Art der Textkultur, die ... den Text
zu einem unmittelbaren Teil des Lebens selbst werden lässt. Das gilt ganz besonders, solange die Texte
ausschließlich mündlich weitergegeben ... werden”. Cf. also Zacchetti 1998: 492-493 on the influence of
sacramental aspects of recitation on the Chinese translation procedures.
14 Pāsādika 1990: 26 (cf. also Pāsādika 2003: 68-69) notes that a discourse quotation in the Abhidharmakośavyākhyā offers additional details on the dynamics that set in, once concentration has been established
based on any of the five occasions for liberation, indicating that such concentration results in a vision in
accordance with reality, which then leads via disenchantment and dispassion to liberation, cf. Wogihara

Conclusion   •   859


of their hearing a recitation of the awakening factors cannot have been merely the receiving of information.
The discourse that reports how the Buddha recovered on hearing a recitation of the
awakening factors has a Chinese and a Sanskrit parallel. Unlike the Pāli version, in
these two parallel versions the account of this event is followed by stanzas spoken by
another monk. One of these stanzas indicates that, during the recitation, the Buddha experienced the taste of liberation (according to the Chinese version) or the taste of the
awakening factors (according to the Sanskrit version). [18] In this way, the Chinese and
Sanskrit accounts specify in what way the recitation acted as a support for meditative
practice, which then in turn would have had an effect at the physical level.
These instances strengthen the impression that recitation, whether performed by oneself or by another, is seen in the early discourses as having a meditative dimension. [19] A
discourse in the A�guttara-nikāya and its Chinese parallels make this point more explicitly, as they recommend practising recitation to overcome sloth-and-torpor. [20] According to the Pāli commentaries, recitation can not only act as an antidote to slothand-torpor, but can also help to overcome any unwholesome thought. [21]
Thus, oral transmission was perceived not only as a means of preserving texts, but also
as an integral part of the path to liberation. [22] In fact, oral recitation continued for a considerable time even after the writing down of the discourses and is to some degree still
practised today, which shows that it must be serving a greater purpose than preservation of the texts. [23]

18 [[SA727]] at T II 195c23:, with its counterpart in bodhya�gakathā� śrutvā, bodhya�gānā� rasa� sa vijñāya in Waldschmidt 1967: 244. The stanzas continue by describing how such
listening to the teachings leads to the arising of joy and to calmness of the body. De Silva 1993: 33 (without knowing the Chinese and Sanskrit versions) states that “when one is reminded of the spiritual qualities one has already cultivated ... great joy must be arising in the mind. Such joy is perhaps capable of
altering the body’s chemistry in a positive manner”.
19 Kwella 1978: 173 notes that “the texts repeat very often the same words ... the citta ... comes to the same
subtle pictures ever and ever again ... a comparatively high concentration of the mind ... will be the ...
result”; cf. also Tuxen 1926: 98-99, who points out that repetition in the Pāli texts has a function comparable to a recurring motif in music.

22 Regarding the religious significance of oral recitation, Kitagawa 1979: 235, based on his study of Ainu
oral tradition, remarks that “there was a time when I considered oral tradition primarily as an archaic
legacy of people living in the pre-civilized stage of civilization. My study ... has convinced me that oral
tradition represents a different mode of religious perception and meaning”.
23 As noted by, e.g., Bechert 1992b: 53, oral tradition continued to exist side by side with written scriptures
for many centuries. According to de Jong 1979b: 141, manuscripts were rare and oral transmission was
held in high esteem (“pendant des siècles, les manuscrits ont d 當隨本所聞法, 隨而受持廣布誦習 û être très rares ... la récitation de textes
聞法如所誦法, religieux jouissait d’un prestige sacr 廣當誦習 é qui faisait défaut aux textes écrits”). This finds confirmation in the
travel records by Făxiăn ( ), who towards the end of the fourth and the beginning of the fifth century

This in turn makes it very probable that oral recitation of at least some key texts
would have been part of the general training of monks and nuns. The importance attached to participation in oral transmission is also reflected in ancient Indian inscriptions, which indicate that to be reckoned a reciter was a considerable honour, [24] all the
more so if a reciter was acquainted with several collections, or even with all three pi�akas. [25]
The commentaries explain that a monk who wishes to live a life of seclusion in the
forest should memorize at least the code of rules and two or three recitation sections
from a discourse collection. [26] The same principle is reflected in the Gulissāni-sutta and
its Madhyama-āgama parallel, according to which even a monk who lives a secluded
life in the forest should still be sufficiently acquainted with the teachings so as to be
able to reply to questions put to him by others.
While the Gulissāni-sutta and its parallel do not explicitly speak of recitation of the
discourses, [27] this becomes explicit in another passage, which records the first meeting
between the Buddha and the recently ordained So�a Ko�ika��a. According to the report of this meeting contained in the Udāna and the Vinaya, the Buddha asked So�a to
recite some Dharma. [28] The Udāna and the Vinaya report that So�a complied by reciting the sixteen discourses of the A��haka-vagga, a group of discourses now found in the
Sutta-nipāta. [29]
The narration that introduces this event indicates that the Buddha, who had already
been pleased by So�a’s conduct, wanted to see if So�a was also able to recite some

went to India in search of Vinaya manuscripts, where he found that the material was still transmitted
mainly through oral means, T 2085 at T LI 864b18:, translated in Legge 1886/1998: 98
(though, as pointed out by Demiéville 1951: 247 note 1, the lack of Vinaya manuscripts could also have
been at least in part due to the intentionally restricted circulation of such material). Sander 1991: 142
suggests that the continuity of oral transmission may be responsible for the dearth “of Hīnayāna Vinaya
and Sūtra texts before the fifth century A.D” among the fragments found in Central Asia; cf. also the
discussion in Salomon 1999: 163-165 on the absence of Vinaya texts among the British Library Kharo��hī fragments and von Gabain 1963: 221 on the absence of Vinaya texts among material translated into
Turk languages.

section of the early Buddhist oral tradition. This suggests that such ability was considered a quality to be expected of a well-trained monk.
As time went by, the corpus of oral material would have continued to grow in size, so
that its preservation must have become an increasingly specialized and demanding task.
This appears to be reflected in the report in the Pāli Vinaya that reciter monks would
sometimes pass the whole night reciting the discourses. [30] Some discourses then voice
criticism of monks who neglect seclusion for the sake of recitation. [31]
Such recitation of the early Buddhist texts was apparently undertaken not only by
monks, but also by nuns. The Theravāda Vinaya records that the nuns Thullanandā and
Bhaddā Kāpilānī were learned Dharma preachers and reciters. [32] In a similar vein, the
Divyāvadāna refers to nuns who were knowledgeable in the Tripi�aka, [33] and the Dīpava�sa records that nuns in Ceylon were able to recite the Vinaya, the five Nikāyas, and
the seven works of the Abhidharma. [34]
The laity also seems at times to have been involved in memorizing the discourses, as
can be seen in the case of the laywoman Khujjuttarā. According to the traditional account, she had memorized the discourses that now make up the Itivuttaka collection
and thereby played a crucial role in preserving this collection for posterity. The Pāli
commentary to this work explains that she had memorized the discourses she had heard
and then passed them on to the nuns, who in turn passed them on to the monks. [35]
Close inspection of the Itivuttaka shows that its discourses differ from other discourses
in their use of peculiar phrases. Instead of beginning with eva� me suta�, discourses
in the Itivuttaka begin with vutta� heta� bhagavatā vuttam arahatā ti me suta�, “This
was said by the Blessed One, said by the arahant, so I have heard”, a peculiarity also preserved in its Chinese parallel. [36] The conclusions of Itivuttaka discourses are similarly

occurrences not in the sense of “reciter”, as the term with this meaning is found only in later texts, but in
the sense of “eloquent”. For a study of the nun Thullanandā cf. Talim 1972: 53-64, who suggests that
there may have been two nuns with this name.

unique and do not recur in this form in other Pāli discourses, as are its formulaic transitions from prose to verse. [37]
These peculiar features of the Ittivuttaka are noteworthy in that they seem to have
resisted the natural tendency of oral transmission to stereotype the introduction and
conclusion of a discourse. This reinforces the impression that some degree of formalization of the material for oral transmission would have taken place at a very early
stage, since in the case of the Itivuttaka it seems as if its formal aspects are related to
the nature of its first recipient(s) and thus came into being soon after their original delivery.
These formal aspects were then apparently passed on unchanged to subsequent generations of reciters, without being changed to fit the form of other discourses. If the
formalization of the discourses had been undertaken at a comparatively late point in
time, the procedure used in the case of other discourses would have been applied similarly to the discourses in the Itivuttaka.
Although the case of Khujjuttarā shows that, from the perspective of the early discourses, the laity could take part in memorizing the discourses, in general the oral
transmission of the texts was probably the domain of the monastic disciples. [38] In fact, a
regulation found in the different Vinayas prohibits teaching recitation “word for word”
to someone who has not received full ordination. [39] This would make it practically impossible to train lay people in recitation to such an extent that they could play a significant role in the preservation of the texts.

37 The conclusion to a discourse, e.g., in It 1:1 at It 1,16, states that: “this meaning was also said by the

a conclusion to its discourses). The pericope employed to lead over from the prose section to verse(s),
e.g., in It 1:1 at It 1,8, indicates that “this is the meaning of what the Blessed One said. In regard to this,
it was said like this”, etam attha� bhagavā avoca, tatth’ eta� iti vuccati. According to the counterpart

Conclusion   •   863


Another Vinaya ruling seems to point in a different direction, since according to the
Theravāda version of this rule monks are allowed to disregard the travelling restrictions
during the rains retreat period for a variety of compelling reasons, one among them
being when a lay disciple has asked them to come in order to learn a discourse from
him, lest it be lost. [40] The Sarvāstivāda Vinaya has preserved this rule differently. According to its report, the reason was not that the monks should come to learn the discourse from the lay disciple, but rather that the lay disciple had forgotten a discourse
and wanted the monks to come and teach it to him again. [41]
Whatever may be the final word on the rationale and wording of this Vinaya regulation, it seems beyond doubt that the oral transmission of the Buddha’s sayings would
have been a central concern of his monastic disciples. In view of this it would be natural if, after the Buddha’s demise, these monastic disciples were to assemble to recite
his teachings. Such a joint recitation would at the same time have functioned as an expression of communal harmony. This would have been in keeping with the dictum that,
after the Buddha’s passing away, the teachings themselves should be taken as the
teacher. [42]
The presence of a multitude of monks, among them monks like Ānanda, whom the
texts present as one who had quite literally “heard much”, would have made a meeting
of the monastic disciples after the Buddha’s passing away an obvious occasion for a
recitation of the discourses. [43] How far this should be reckoned as a “council” is another

40 Vin I 140,36.
41 T 1435 at T XXIII 174b28: ; cf. also Clarke
2000: 165.
42 Cf., e.g., fragment [[SN360]] folio 180V6-R1 in Waldschmidt 1950: 23, according to which the monks should
take refuge in the discourses instead of taking refuge in a person, [bhi](k�ubhi�) sūtrāntaprati-[sara�]air-bhav[i]tavya� na pudgala(p)[r](atisara�ai�). [[MN108]] at MN III 9,23 and [[MA145]] at T I 654b23
report that, after the Buddha’s passing away, the instruction to take refuge in the teachings was put into
practice.
43 Davidson 1990/1992: 299 suggests that, during the rains retreat after the Buddha had passed away, “the
younger monks, many of whom may have never heard the Buddha preach, wanted further information
about the teaching of the master. The elders, too, doubtless wished to increase their understanding ...
thus the first rains retreat became a forum ... some of the teachings of the master were recited, and some 若未學欲學, 若先學忘欲誦, 大德來教我受學讀誦問義
verses standardized, but it is highly unlikely that there was any formal collection ... of the master’s teachings”. Regarding the historical reliability of the account of this first council, Oldenberg 1879/1997:
xxvii points out that the record of the events after the Buddha’s passing away in [[DN16]] at DN II 162,6,
although in other respects similar to the introductory narration to the first council at Vin II 284,2, does
not mention the first council. Oldenberg 1879/1997: xxviii then concludes that “the author of the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta did not know anything of the first Council”; cf. also Dutt 1957: 102 and Franke 1908:
66-74. The difficulty of drawing conclusions based on such arguments ex silentio can be seen in the
case of [[MN26]] at MN I 167,8, where an account of the events that precede the Buddha’s awakening
does not record how his awakening came about, although such an account can be found in [[MN36]] at
MN I 240,29 (repeated again in [[MN85]] and [[MN100]]). As [[MN26]] and [[MN36]] belong to the same discourse collection, the present case could not be due to the reciters of one discourse not knowing the contents of the other discourse, but appears to be simply due to the requirements of the topic treated in [[MN26]] which is the “noble quest” that motivated the bodhisattva’s search for a path to liberation. Similarly,

matter, since the need to establish a certain corpus of texts as “canonical” would presumably have arisen only after divergences on this corpus had come into being. [44]
In fact, although the different Vinaya accounts of the compilation of the early Buddhist canon agree in mentioning four basic collections, the four Āgamas or Nikāyas, [45]
they disagree on the sequence of these four. [46] This, together with the quite different


the requirements of the topic of the teacher’s “great passing away”, treated in [[DN16]] could well be responsible for the absence of any reference to the first council; cf. also Ch’en 1958, de La Vallée Poussin

Prebish 1974b: 239-240; for a position taken recently in favour of Oldenberg’s theory cf. [[AN2001]] 52.
44 Bareau 1955: 28; cf. also Frauwallner 1952: 241. Rhys Davids 1910: 77 comments that the account of
the first council “is authentic enough; but only in the way in which any such record can be considered
authentic, that is, as evidence of beliefs held at the date at which it was composed”.
45 The term āgama occurs regularly in the Pāli discourses in reference to the orally transmitted texts that a
monk was expected to know, although in such instances the term appears to be still used in a general
and unspecified way; cf. [[AN10.44]] at AN V 80,23, where a monk, who has not yet become one who remembers the discourses, is told to “learn an/the āgama”, āgama� pariyāpu�assū ti, a recommendation
also given in Vin II 249,16. The same term recurs in the expression āgat’ āgama to qualify a learned
monk, cf., e.g., Vin I 119,22, Vin I 127,30, Vin I 337,12, Vin I 338,20, Vin II 8,28, Vin II 55,19, Vin II
98,5, Vin II 299,16, Vin IV 158,18 (this case involves a learned layman), [[DN16]] at DN II 125,6 (= [[AN4.180]] at AN II 169,18), [[MN33]] at MN I 221,21, [[AN5.25]] at AN I 117,28, [[AN8.7]] at AN II 147,29, [[AN5.156]] at AN III 179,2, [[AN6.51]] at AN III 361,23, [[AN10.11]] at AN V 15,30, and [[AN11.18]] at AN V 349,16.
Uddānas in B [e] -MN II 439,10 and C [e] -MN II 760,14 even use the term majjhima-āgama. Barua 1923: 359
comments that “in the Pāli discourses ... the expression Āgama is often met with, no doubt in the sense
of a floating body of Buddhist literary traditions”. The expression nikāya, however, in the sense of a collection of discourses, appears to occur only in the account of the first council in Vin II 287,27, which
speaks of the recitation of the pañca nikāye (not taking into account occurrences in later works like the
Parivāra). Lamotte 1958/1988: 152 notes that, while the account of the first council in the Samantapāsādikā similarly employs the expression nikāya, the instead uses the expression āgama, cf.
T 1462 at T XXIV 675b22:, translated in Bapat 1970: 9 as “the four Āgamas”, counterpart to cattāro nikāye in Sp I 16,14. Abeynayake 1984: 10 points out that “there are no references to the term Nikāya used in the sense of a collection of the Sutta Pi�aka in older texts”. Hartmann 2004a: 11 notes that
“Āgama or Nikāya. Neither term is school-specific”. Analogous terminology is found also in Jain texts,
e.g., the Vavahāra 1.35 in Schubring 1918: 15,4+6 refers to a monk who is bahu-ssuya� babbh-āgama�;
cf. also Caillat 1965: 50. Schubring 1966: 69 relates this to a similar usage in Aśoka’[[SN12]] [th] Rock Edict
(Girnār), which combines bahusrutā with kallā�’ āgamā, cf. Bloch 1950: 123,29 or Woolner 1924/1993:
24,6. On the term āgama in non-Buddhist texts cf. also Kumoi 1963: 245.
46 The accounts of the compilation of the discourse collections at the first council in the Mahāsā�ghika Vinaya, T 1425 at XXII 491c16, and in the Mahīśāsaka 善見律毘婆沙 Vinaya, T 1421 at T XXII 191a24 (translated in
Anuruddha 2008: 27 and 75), agree with the Theravāda tradition’s order 四阿鋡 Dīrgha, Madhyama, Sa�yukta,
Ekottarika (Vin II 287,27 does not list the order explicitly, although this sequence appears to be implicit
to some extent in its reference to the five Nikāyas and to the Brahmajāla and the Sāmaññaphala as the
first discourses recited at the council). Elsewhere, however, the Mahāsā�ghika Vinaya, T 1425 at T
XXII 492c18 uses the order Sa�yukta, Ekottarika, Madhyama, Dīrgha. The (presumably) Haimavata
Vinaya, T 1463 at T XXIV 820a23 lists Ekottarika, Madhyama, Dīrgha, Sa�yukta. The Dharmaguptaka
Vinaya, T 1428 at T XXII 968b19 (translated in Anuruddha 2008: 68), lists the four collections in the or

allocation of discourses to these four Āgamas or Nikāyas, makes it clear that these discourse collections cannot have been recited at that time in the form we have them now. [47]
The agreement between the different traditions in referring to four main collections
suggests, however, that this basic four-fold grouping could be a shared heritage, whose
actual content and order then evolved in different ways in various reciter traditions. [48]
Given that presumably no particular arrangement had received canonical status at the
outset, the basic subdivision into Nikāyas or Āgamas would have been handled flexibly, allowing for changes in the sequence within each collection and also for easy transference from one collection to another. In this way, the allocation of discourses to a
collection probably reflects the interests of particular groups of reciters and their specific requirements. The division into four Nikāyas or Āgamas would, however, have
already been known and in use in some form at a relatively early stage of the Buddhist


der Dīrgha, Madhyama, Ekottarika, Sa�yukta. The (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, T 1451 at T XXIV
407b27, adopts the order Sa�yukta, Dīrgha, Madhyama, Ekottarika. This order appears to underlie also
the presentation in the Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, T 1435 at T XXIII 448b13 (translated in Anuruddha 2008:
47), which begins its account of the collection of the canon with the first sermon spoken by the Buddha,
although this Vinaya does not list the four collections and therefore does not explicitly specify their order.
For a more detailed study that takes into account additional records of the first council cf. Przyluski
1926 (for a listing of relevant sources cf. Lamotte 1958/1988: 155 and Tsukamoto 1963: 824); on the
order of the four collections in other works cf. also Mayeda 1985: 96. The influence of personal preferences on the order in which these four collections are listed can even be seen in the Pāli commentaries
where, as Endo 2003a: 67 points out, the Vinaya commentaries show a predilection for referring to the
commentary on the Majjhima-nikāya, before mentioning the commentaries on the other three Nikāyas.
47 In fact, this is not even the position taken by tradition itself. This much can be seen in the case of the
Bakkula-sutta, which has as its speaker a monk who is introduced as having been ordained for eighty
years. Thus this discourse necessarily stems from a period considerably later than the Buddha’s demise,
cf. [[MN124]] at MN III 125,6 and [[MA34]] at T I 475a21; cf. also above p. 716. Hence the commentary, Ps
IV 197,2, assigns the inclusion of the Bakkula-sutta in the canon to the second sa�gīti, thereby clearly
acknowledging that the Majjhima-nikāya now found in the Theravāda canon could not have been recited
in this form at the first sa�gīti. Other discourses in the Majjhima-nikāya that explicitly locate themselves after the Buddha’s passing away (though here the idea could be that they took place in the period
between his passing away and the first sa�gīti) are [[MN84]] at MN II 90,16, [[MN94]] at MN II 162,24, and
[[MN108]] at MN III 7,13, each of which states that the Buddha had already passed away.
48 According to Bechert 1991: 9 (cf. also Bechert 1980: 27), the four collections “originated as the result of
local applications of the same principles of organisation to bodies of traditional material that were still
largely in agreement”. Hartmann 2004a: 11 speaks of a “common origin, followed by a long period of
separate transmissions with independent redactional changes”. Prasad 1985: 137, commenting on the arrangement of discourses in the canons of various schools, notes that “the criteria for such distribution
were clear but the discourses are by nature such that they satisfy more than a single criteria”. Norman
1989a: 33 suggests that “probably ... from the earliest period of Buddhism the collection of sermons was
made on the basis of length, the Dīgha- and Majjhima-nikāyas containing long and middle-length sermons respectively, while the shorter sermons were either arranged by subject matter (Sa�yutta-nikāya)
or on a numerical basis (A�guttara-nikāya). These collections were then allotted to groups of bhikkhus
for transmission”. Thomas 1933/2004: 157 concludes that “the arrangement of the four Nikāyas and
Āgamas must ... have originated before sectarian differences became acute ... [as] the same principle of
division is found in all schools”.

oral tradition. [49] In fact, archaeological evidence appears to indicate that, from the second century BC onwards, several of the Nikāya or Āgama collections were known by
name even in Sri Lanka. [50]
The fact that a rock edict by Aśoka refers only to some single texts need not imply
that the four collections were not yet in existence at that time. The edict explicitly indicates that the texts it mentions should be learned by the laity, not only by monastics. [51]
It would be unreasonable for Aśoka to expect that the laity in general should learn a
whole collection of discourses, let alone all four Nikāyas or Āgamas. Thus, the instruction in this edict can only be meant to present a selection of texts, whose size does not

49 Unlike the partition into Āgamas or Nikāyas, it seems to me that the a�ga system would not have been
able to fulfil the function of dividing the material to be transmitted orally among the reciters; cf. also
Anālayo 2009l. The problem I see is that dividing the texts according to individual a�gas would not
yield groupings of material suitable for division of labour among reciters, as this would require portions
of roughly equal size that provide the respective reciters with a representative selection of teachings. As
already noted by Jayawickrama 1959: 11, some a�gas show a considerable degree of overlap in meaning with one another, which would not make it easy to use them as distinct markers for such division of
labour. Other a�gas are of comparatively rare occurrence, e.g., udāna or itivuttaka, where a collection
of all instances would result in a rather small number of actual texts in comparison with other a�gas.
Moreover, a�gas like abbhutadhamma would not result in a collection of texts that comprehensively
covers the chief aspects of the teaching. Already with the division into four Āgamas or Nikāyas, differences in opinion and understanding appear to have made themselves acutely felt among the reciters, cf.,
e.g., Adikaram 1946/1994: 27-32, Dutt 1978: 42, Endo 2003a, id. 2003b, Goonesekera 1968: 689, and
Mori 1990: 127. Reciters of only abbhutadhamma (to stay with my example) would, in consequence of
the only type of text with which they had thoroughly familiarized themselves, have tended to develop a
lop-sided understanding and a consequently unbalanced way of teaching. This makes it rather improbable that such a division of labour was ever actually in use during any significant time period of the
early Buddhist oral tradition. In fact, the account of the formation of the Buddhist canon in the Dīpava�sa does not imply a replacement of the a�ga system with the four Nikāyas, but rather appears to
refer to the nine a�gas as representative of the Dharma as a whole, which then were divided into āgamas for the purpose of their oral transmission, cf. Dīp 4.15 in Oldenberg 1879: 31,22. The assumption
that the a�gas were never really meant to be divisions of texts for memorization and thus had no specific practical purpose for the reciters would naturally explain why the significance of some individual
a�gas were soon forgotten, with tradition as well as modern scholarship often finding it quite difficult to
make sense out of some of them (cf. also above p. 149 and p. 697).
50 This has been suggested by Norman 1978: 31, who notes that “an inscription of the second century B.C.
includes a reference to a majhimaba�aka, which implies that some, at least, of the nikāyas were known
by that date”. Norman 1989a: 33 then remarks (in regard to inscriptions collected by Paranavitana) that
“it is clear from inscriptional evidence that the nikāyas had certainly received their names by the second
century BC”. These inscriptions in Paranavitana 1970 refer to different majhima-ba�akas (no. 330 p. 26,
no. 708 p. 53 and no. 852 p. 66), to a śayutaka-ba�aka (no. 666 p. 50), and to an eka-utirika-ba�aka
(no. 407 p. 32). In addition to these references to reciters of single Nikāyas or Āgamas, the same collection of inscriptions has also preserved a reference to a sutata-pā�i-bā�aka (no. 1202 p. 97). If the abovementioned dating should be correct, then this would provide remarkably early evidence of the form in
which the canon was transmitted to Sri Lanka.
51 Cf. Hultzsch 1925: 173, Bloch 1950: 154, or Woolner 1924/1993: 34. Gokhale 1994/2001b: 55 comments that “Asoka in his Bairat (Bhabru) inscriptions recommends seven texts as deserving special attention. The emphasis seems to be on texts that are of direct relevance to the laity”.


Conclusion   •   867


exceed the amount an average busy householder, not trained in the art of memorizing,
could safely be expected to remember. [52]
Since the edict could not have recommended learning the four Nikāyas or Āgamas,
the absence of any reference to these collections is only natural and has no bearing on
whether they were already in existence.
Summing up the main points of my exploration so far:

 - the requirements of memorization make it probable that some formulaic features
were already present in the texts when these were originally delivered;

 - the texts indicate that oral transmission was not only seen as a means to preserve
texts, but also as an integral part of the path to liberation, and as such was apparently practiced by monastics and at times also by the laity;

 - with the growth of the corpus of material to be memorized, it seems probable that
some basic division into four Nikāyas or Āgamas came into being at a relatively
early stage.
On the basis of these general observations, I now turn to a more detailed examination
of those aspects that probably lie behind the variations that manifest between parallel
versions of a discourse, such variations being a recurrent finding throughout my comparative study of the Majjhima-nikāya discourses in the light of their parallels.


The Precision of Textual Memory

The concerns of oral transmission and proper memorization are reflected in several
discourses. For example, according to a discourse in the A�guttara-nikāya five conditions keep the Dharma from decline:

 - learning the texts,

 - teaching them to others,

 - making others recite them,

 - memorizing them,

 - reflecting on them. [53]
All of these five qualities revolve around oral transmission, with three of them directly addressing central requirements of its proper execution. Another A�guttara-nikāya discourse additionally emphasizes that, for the Dharma to prosper, the monks

52 Skilling 1996c: 224 in fact notes that, of the seven texts mentioned in Aśoka’s recommendation that
have so far been identified with some degree of confidence, all except the Ambala��hikārāhulovādasutta, [[MN61]] are in verse (in the case of [[MN61]] the absence of verses is a peculiarity of the Pāli version, cf. above p. 346). Ibid. points out that “verses are associated with Rāhula in the Sarvāstivādin and
Mūlasarvāstivādin Rāhula-sūtras, in the nidānas of the Udāna-(varga) in Chinese and Tibetan, and in
the nidāna of a Dharmapada in Chinese. Is it possible that Aśoka was referring to some of these
verses?”. If this suggestion is correct, it would further strengthen the impression that the selection was
made with a view to gathering material that is easily memorized, for which verse would be particularly
appropriate. On another set of texts in verse, probably also chosen for easy memorizing, cf. Salomon
1999: 158-160.
53 [[AN10.84]] at AN III 177,31.

should memorize the texts carefully and take care to make others recite them correctly. [54]
A passage in the Theravāda Vinaya attributes the short duration of the teachings of
the former Buddhas Vipassī, Sikhī, and Vessabhū to the absence of a well-established
corpus of material for oral transmission, comparable to flowers that are not strung together on a string and thus are easily scattered by the wind. [55] In contrast, the teachings
of those former Buddhas who passed on a well-established textual corpus to their disciples lasted long, like flowers that are strung together on a string and therefore are not
so easily scattered.
The concern with correct memorization of the texts finds its expression also in a recurrent injunction given at the outset of a discourse, which records the Buddha telling
his disciples that they should pay proper attention to what he is going to say. [56] This injunction alerts the audience – be these those present during the original delivery or later
generations who are listening to a recitation of the discourse – to the fact that, what is
about to be said, should be memorized and kept in mind. This phrase has a counterpart
in another pericope, according to which the monks promise that they will memorize what
the Buddha is about to teach them. [57]
Thus, the requirements of accurate oral transmission are a recurrent theme in the
early discourses and in the Vinaya, suggesting that this would have been one of the central concerns of the early generations of the Buddha’s disciples.
In their attempt to transmit textual material orally, the early Buddhist reciters would
have had the Vedic oral tradition as their model. [58] Long before the time of the Buddha,
the oral transmission of the Vedas had apparently acquired a high degree of precision.
This was achieved by systematically training reciters from their early youth onwards.
Young Brahmins would already begin learning the texts by rote when they were about
eight years old. Only after having completed this task, following years of memorization, would they study the meaning of what they had learned. [59]

way they learn it by heart ... 諸比丘從世尊聞已, only few of them learn 善受善持 its explanation” 宋, . Staal 元, 1979: 明 122 sums up that “sound

Conclusion   •   869


The Assalāyana-sutta and the Ca�kī-sutta seem to reflect an awareness of such a
system, as they describe Brahmin youths who are already accomplished in knowledge
of the Vedas at the age of sixteen. [ 60] The two discourses report that these Brahmin
youths were consequently treated with such respect and honour by other Brahmins that
they were asked to act as speakers for the Brahmin community in a debate with the
Buddha.
Although the early Buddhist oral tradition undoubtedly inherited some of the features
of the Vedic oral tradition, it differed in several respects. One such difference was the
adoption of a vernacular for the transmission. [61] Not only in regard to language, but also
in terms of content some of the early Buddhist texts show the influence of contemporary secular elements. [62] These points reflect a basic difference in attitude, where for the
Vedic tradition correct wording was of crucial importance, whereas for the early Buddhist tradition the content of what was transmitted was more important than its form. [63]

60 The two discourses agree in specifying that the learned young Brahmins were only sixteen or even only
fifteen years old, cf. [[MN93]] at MN II 147,10 and its parallel T 71 at T I 876c10 (another parallel, [[MA151]] at T I 663c8, does not specify the young Brahmin’s age), as well as [[MN95]] at MN II 168,18 (the
Sanskrit fragment parallels to this discourse do not specify the young Brahmin’s age).

Geiger 1916: 5, Lévi 1915: 441-447, Levman 2008/2009, Lin Li-Kouang 1949: 217-227, Norman 1971/

however, not directed against formalization of the texts for the sake of exact memorization, as assumed
by Klaus 2010: 523, in fact, as suggested above, pp. 855-856, some degree of formalization would have
been integral to the texts from the very outset.
62 Lienhard 1984: 77 notes that Theragāthā poems “took over the conventions and imagery of contemporary kāvya ... [and] quite clearly imitated the existent literary forms of secular poetry”. Lienhard 1975:
388-393 describes that often a Theragāthā stanza will at first take up the image of rain, frequently employed in ancient Indian love poetry (as in a predominantly agricultural society the time of the rains
would be the time of being confined to the home and thus the time of love making), but then, instead of
following up this image with some reference to the wish for love and company, the stanza will turn to
the Dharma, as if to provide a conscious contrast to the pattern usually observed in love poetry; cf. also
Chaudhary 1994d: 143-144. On the different use of natural imagery in the Therīgāthā cf. also Horner
1930/1990: 209, Rajapakse 1995: 140, and Trainor 1993: 64 note 17.
63 Lopez 1995: 37 comments that “the śrotriyas were concerned with the precise preservation of the sounds
of the Vedas while the śrāvakas were concerned with the preservation of the meaning of the Buddha’s
word in the vernacular”; cf. also Gamage 2003: 209 and Monier-Williams 1889/1995: 53-54; on the sacredness of word and sound in the Vedic tradition cf., e.g., Beck 1993: 23-48, Padoux 1990: 1-29, Renou 1955, Ruegg 1959: 15-21, and Strauß 1927: 127-135. Another difference in attitude has been highlighted by Mookerji 1947/1999: 462, who notes that in the early Buddhist case there was a “looseness of
the organization ... increased by the constant changes in the composition of the local Sa�ghas themselves. The result of all this was that there was no common authority to reconcile the differences that inevitably arose” once the Buddha had passed away, which in turn inevitably would have had repercussions on the way the texts were transmitted. Houben 2009: 85 also notes that, in the case of the �gveda
in particular, the precision of oral transmission would have been closely related to the ritual function of
its hymns, something that would not have been relevant in the early Buddhist case.

This is neatly exemplified in the “discourse on recitation” (Sajjhāya-sutta) in the
Sa�yutta-nikāya and its two Sa�yukta-āgama parallels. The three parallel versions describe a monk who used to recite regularly, but at some point suddenly stopped. Asked
why he had stopped, the monk explained that in the meantime he had reached liberation. [64] Hence, he felt no need to keep on reciting what by then he had fully realized
himself.
A difference between the Vedic and the early Buddhist oral traditions that has important ramifications for the Buddhist oral transmission is that, whereas Brahmin reciters were trained in their task from early childhood, most of the early Buddhist reciters
would have started training in oral transmission only at a mature age. [65] Moreover,
whereas Brahmin youths memorized texts without understanding their meaning, the
Buddhist reciters memorized texts whose meaning they would for the most part have
understood. [66] The centrality accorded to such understanding can be seen from the

comments that “this shows ... the original significance that the svādhyāya method had for Buddhist
monks”.
65 Von Hinüber 1989: 67-68 points out that, while Brahmins were trained from their childhood onwards in
memorizing, training as a reciter in the early Buddhist tradition would have begun only after ordination,
which usually took place at a considerably later age; cf. also Frauwallner 1956: 173-175 and Gombrich
1990a: 6-7. Schopen 2010: 127 then goes so far as to propose that “there is very little evidence in the
various Vinayas that would support the notion that the Buddhist tradition had developed, or had in place,
a sufficiently sophisticated system that would allow them to transmit anything like the enormous bulk of
canonical material that we know. There is a stunning contrast between what is seen in brahmanical
sources where elaborate procedures and mechanisms were put in place to insure the transmission of
what in comparison is a very small textual corpus”. This statement seems to overlook the significance of
the pācittiya or pātayantika rule on not teaching recitation word for word to a layperson, already discussed by Wynne 2004: 109, cf. in more detail above p. 862 note 39. This rule clearly reflects the existence of a formal procedure adopted for oral transmission among monastics. Given that the pātimokkha
or prātimok�a is generally held to represent the earliest textual layer of Vinaya material at our disposal,
the agreement of the different Vinayas in the case of this rule provides strong evidence for the existence
of such a formal procedure for oral transmission at a very early stage. Moreover, for a proper assessment of the situation the discourses also need to be taken into account, not only the Vinayas, and there
one finds recurrent references (some of which I have discussed above) to an ongoing oral transmission.
The continuity of oral transmission can then be seen from inscriptions, mentioned, e.g., in Schopen 1985/
1997: 44-45 (cf. also above pp. 860 and 866 notes 24, 25, and 50), which records that monastics had
memorized one or more collections, or even the entire canon. Thus, to assume that the early Buddhist
reciters had been unable to transmit the canonical texts (which at that time would anyway have been
considerably less than what eventually came to be considered canonical, not yet comprising, e.g., the
Abhidharma, or the mass of tales included in the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya) does not properly reflect
the evidence at our disposition. This evidence clearly points to the existence of a system of oral transmission among the early Buddhist reciters that was sufficiently developed to enable them to transmit the
canonical texts, albeit without the degree of precision that their Vedic counterparts apparently achieved.
66 Later Buddhist traditions seem to have oriented themselves more closely to the Vedic model, as according to Xuánzàng's ( ) travel records reciters of the Sarvāstivāda tradition were able to recite the whole
Tripi�aka from memory, without, however, understanding the meaning of what they were reciting; cf. T

Alagaddūpama-sutta and its parallel, for example, according to which those, who learn
the Buddha’s teachings without endeavouring to understand what they have learned,
are reckoned to be just fools. [67]
This difference acquires considerable significance when considered in the light of the
modern day academic research on textual memory. [68] This research has shown that textual memory does not work in a way comparable to a tape recorder or a copy machine,
faithfully producing an exact replica of the words originally read or heard. [69] Memory,
far from being merely reproductive, is rather of a constructive nature. [70] At the time of
trying to recall, the mind constructs the information anew. It is this act of constructing
or reconstructing which will determine the way the information is being remembered. [71]
Not only on the occasion of trying to recall something that took place in the past, but
already at the time when something is heard or read that is to be memorized, information is not simply taken in. Rather, the information is stored in the mind together with
inferences made by the reader or listener. The drawing of inferences is in fact a neces

the age of seven, but was taught the meaning of what he had learned only after he had successfully memorized a staggering amount of material, . An outstanding
feat of memory is also reported for Buddhayaśas, who presumably managed to memorize a Chinese
medical text comprising 50,000 characters (obviously a text he did not understand) within a few days,

70 Already Bartlett 1932: 205 remarked that “remembering appears to be far more decisively an affair of
construction, rather than one of mere reproduction”, explaining (p. 207) that “when a subject is being
asked to remember, very often the first thing that emerges is something of the nature of an attitude. The
recall is then a construction, made largely on the basis of this attitude”. Bartlett (p. 213) concludes that
for this reason “remembering ... is an imaginative reconstruction ... [and] is thus hardly ever really
exact, even in the most rudimentary cases of rote recapitulation”. 癡人
71 Anderson 1978 reports an experiment where subjects were given the task of remembering the description of a house from the perspective of a prospective burglar or a prospective buyer of the house. After a
first recall, some subjects were asked to shift perspective (e.g., “buyer” instead of “burglar”) and consequently were able to recall details they had earlier been unable to remember, whereas a control group
that did not change perspective did not show a similar increase in ability to recall additional details on
the second occasion. Anderson 1978: 10 concludes that these experiments show that the attitude during
information retrieval influences the way things are remembered. A complementary perspective on how
memory can be influenced has been investigated by Goff 1998: 28, who devised experiments that were
able to show how “imagining actions led subjects to remember that they had actually performed the actions when in fact they had not”, an effect that “increased with the number of imaginings, as did subjects’ confidence about their erroneous responses”, a rather disconcerting finding about the reliability of
human memory.

sary aspect of comprehension, since without the drawing of inferences a text will not
be understood. [72]
Thus, the normal ability to recall is based on the successful drawing of inferences, [73]
in fact the degree to which a text is remembered stands in close relationship to the degree to which inferences are drawn. As a general rule, a text that is so easy to understand that it requires only a minimum of inferences, as well as a text that is so difficult
to understand that attempts to draw inferences fail to produce a coherent result, are less
well remembered than a text that requires the drawing of an average amount of inferences in order to be understood. [74]
There is, however, an exception to this general pattern. A particularly significant research finding is that someone, who is given a text that he or she does not understand at
all, may nevertheless be able to remember this text with more precision than someone
who has understood the text well. [75] That is, if someone is given the task of remembering a text that he or she does not understand, a memory representation will be generated without inferences, as attempts to draw inferences will be unsuccessful. Such a
memory representation without inferences can result in a more accurate reflection of
the original text than memory representations that involve the drawing of inferences.


72 Carrol 1986/1999: 168 states that “inferences are not mere recall errors, nor are they random, spurious
contributions by imaginative readers. Inferences are intrinsic to discourse structure. Authors leave out
information that they think readers will be able to figure out”. According to Eysenck 1992/2005: 377,
“comprehension of discourse would be impossible without the process of drawing inferences”.
73 Van den Broek 1994: 580 explains that “inferential processes during reading form the basis for a stable
memory representation of the text”. Harley 1995/1996: 224 points out that “comprehension is to some
extent a constructive process: we build a model of what we are processing ... we make inferences to maintain coherence”.
74 Mason 2004: 1-2 notes that “memory for the text is best for events that are related by a moderate degree
of causal relatedness and is poorer for events with low and high relatedness”. He explains the results of
his experiments to be that “the reading of the moderately related sentence pairs was accompanied by
both the generation and the integration of causal inferences. In the highly related sentences, this inferencing process was unnecessary, resulting in faster reading times and more sparse text representations.
In contrast, the distantly related sentences had slower reading times, presumably as a result of a liberal
generation of possible inferences to connect them, but lower recall, as a result of lack of success in integrating any inference”. Myers 1990: 166-167 explains that “the low recall at the high-related level ... is
not due to lack of attention paid”, suggesting that the better performance at the moderately related level
is probably due to the fact that “recall is facilitated when the reader has stored an elaborative inference
with the sentence ... in memory”.
75 The experiment in question presented texts with instructions about the use of Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel to three groups of readers, asking them to remember the text and subsequently testing
memory through a recognition task in which the participants had to decide if a particular statement had
been made in the original text. Of these participants, the first group had no experience with computer
software, while the second group had some experience and the third group had advanced knowledge of
computer software. Caillies 2002: 284 reports a surprising result of this experiment to have been that
“contrary to our expectations, the beginner participants recognized true targets faster than the other two
groups ... Our interpretation is that the answers of the beginners were based mainly upon the surface
features of the text”.


Conclusion   •   873


This finding helps to clarify the effects and consequences of one of the basic differences between the oral transmission of the Vedas and the early Buddhist oral transmission. In terms of the findings of modern research into textual memory, the Vedic reciters were unable to draw inferences while storing text in their memory. Since they
had been trained from early childhood to use this level of memory, they developed the
ability to recall texts precisely, even after longer intervening periods. [76]
The reason this worked so well was not in spite of their lack of comprehension, but,
as the above-mentioned psychological research suggests, very much because they did
not understand what they were memorizing. Had they understood, the inference-drawing level of textual comprehension would have been activated and would have influenced the way the text was stored in memory.
The early Buddhist reciters, in contrast, would have understood most if not all of what
they were memorizing. In fact, while the Vedic oral transmission was intended only for
a restricted circle of initiates, the Buddhist discourses were meant for public teaching,
occasions where an understanding of the material to be presented would be a central
requirement.
Thus, besides the fact that in the case of the Buddhist reciters the storing of information was not always done by those who had been trained in memorization from their
early youth onward, the information to be remembered was also not of such a type that
it would automatically have prevented the drawing of inferences. In view of this, it
would only be natural if with the early Buddhist reciters the process of drawing inferences were to leave its mark on the material transmitted. The need to counterbalance
the effects of this reconstructing activity of textual memory would in fact explain why
early Buddhist oral material uses repetition and other mnemonic aids to a greater extent
than do Vedic texts. [77]
In terms of modern research on textual memory, it therefore seems that the early Buddhist reciters involved in the transmission of the discourses tended to “draw inferences”.
Because of this tendency to draw inferences, the material would have been stored together with those inferences and on retrieval was “re-constructed”.
The effects of such “reconstruction” become particularly evident when different versions of a discourse agree about the contents of a teaching but disagree about the sequence in which they present this teaching. In what follows, I briefly present, by way
of illustration, three examples of sequential variation between parallel discourses.

76 Bransford 1973: 399 suggests that although “those activities related to comprehending may also be those
most conducive to learning prose materials”, “it should be possible to train subjects in better memorizing strategies”, which appears to have been indeed the case with the Vedic reciters.
77 Allon 1997a: 363 notes that the “early Vedic prose texts, despite incorporating many forms of repetition,
do not exhibit such gross repetitiveness” as the early Buddhist texts, a difference he attributes to the circumstance that “Brahmanical literature was transmitted by individuals who had undertaken long periods
of specialised training”, which was not necessarily the case for the Buddhist monastic reciters. He concludes that “repetition was, then, the vehicle chosen by the early Buddhists to ensure the successful
transmission of the Buddha’s teaching by individuals of mixed social and educational backgrounds”; cf.
also von Simson 1977: 479-480 and von Hinüber 1994b: 6.


874   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


The Devadaha-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel record the same ironic criticism of the ascetic practices undertaken by the Jains. Both versions explain that the experience of pleasure and pain might be attributed to different reasons, which the Pāli
version lists in the following sequence:

 - one’s former deeds,

 - a creator god,

 - the company one kept,

 - the type of one’s life-form,

 - one’s present practice. [78]
In all these cases the Jains are to be blamed, as their present painful experiences will
consequently have to be attributed to their former evil deeds, etc. While the Pāli version lists the creator god as its second item, the Chinese parallel has the same in fifth
place, thereby adopting the following sequence:

 - one’s former deeds,

 - the company one kept,

 - the type of one’s life-form,

 - one’s present practice,

 - a creator god. [79]
Another example can be found in an examination of the relation of karma to rebirth,
presented in the Mahākammavibha�ga-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel. [80] The
Pāli version examines the following cases:

 - evil conduct followed by rebirth in hell,

 - evil conduct followed by rebirth in heaven,

 - good conduct followed by rebirth in heaven,

 - good conduct followed by rebirth in hell.
Its Madhyama-āgama parallel instead presents its otherwise similar exposition in the
following sequence:

 - evil conduct followed by rebirth in heaven,

 - good conduct followed by rebirth in hell,

 - evil conduct followed by rebirth in hell,

 - good conduct followed by rebirth in heaven.
Yet another example can be found in the Sa�āyatanavibha�ga-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel, which examine three possible situations that could occur when the
Buddha teaches. [81] According to the Pāli version, these three are:

 - all disciples do not listen,

 - some disciples do not listen and some disciples do listen,

 - all disciples listen.
The sequence found in the Madhyama-āgama version instead proceeds like this:

Conclusion   •   875


 - all disciples do not listen,

 - all disciples listen,

 - some disciples do not listen and some disciples do listen.
Readers who have had the patience to accompany me through the preceding pages of
my comparative study of the discourses of the Majjhima-nikāya will not have failed to
notice the frequent occurrence of such type of variation. The same is also evident in the
differing sequences in which minor rules are listed in the pātimokkhas or prātimok�as
of different schools and in the varying sequences in which doctrinal items are listed in
the parallel versions to the Sa�gīti-sutta and the Dasuttara-sutta of the Dīgha-nikāya. [82]
The main point that emerges from a consideration of such variations is that these sequential differences do not seem to be invariably an outcome of conscious editing or
redacting. There often seems to be no purpose or advantage in presenting the items in
different sequences, as the variations in sequence do not appear to have any significant
effect on the teaching given in the respective discourses. [83] In other words, it would be
difficult to suggest a motive or purpose underlying each of the sequential variations
noted in my comparative study of the Majjhima-nikāya. Such differences and variations
appear to be simply accidents of transmission, whose origin is most naturally attributed
to the very nature of oral transmission and to the limitations of human memory.
By this I am certainly not intending to rule out that some differences have been consciously introduced. My point is only that there appears to be a common tendency
among scholars to assume that editors and redactors who consciously introduce change
are the normative model for explaining how the texts came to be as we have them now. [84]
This appears to me to be an unwarranted application of one’s own experience with
publishing in the modern world to a situation that is quite different, namely to an oral
society in the distant past with ways of producing ‘texts’ that were governed entirely
by orality and thus are far removed from the processes that nowadays contribute to the
creation of a literary product. [85]


82 For the code of rules cf. the concordance in Pachow 1955: appendix iv; for sequential variations in the
case of the Sa�gīti-sutta and its parallels cf. the concordance in Stache-Rosen 1968: 213-217.
83 Cousins 1984: 288 comments, regarding parallel versions of discourses preserved by different traditions,
that “such variation as exists is probably due to chance rather than sectarian differences. Indeed this is
wholly to be expected in an oral literature”; cf. also Harvey 1990: 3, who concludes that the differences
found between parallel versions “can be seen to be due to the way in which oral traditions always produce several different permutations of essentially the same story or teachings”.
84 To give just one example of the tendency to assume deliberate change to be the norm, Wynne 2004
offers an insightful study of early Buddhist oral transmission, yet a few years later Wynne 2010: 205
writes, regarding the “early Buddhist composers”, that the “evidence indicates that they worked in groups,
which implies discussion, deliberation and so a certain degree of planning”. Thus, even a good acquaintance with the oral features of the texts does not necessarily seem to result in fully taking into account
the way oral material comes into being.
85 Nattier 2003a: 52 clarifies that “to assume a ‘creative individual author’ as the driving force behind interpolations in Buddhist scripture is to import a model that is foreign to most of the literary processes
that have shaped the production of Indian religious texts”.


876   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


Sequential variations at times manifest even within a single textual corpus transmitted by the same reciters. Thus, for example, the Cū�adhammasamādāna-sutta lists four
ways of undertaking things in the following manner: [86]

 - pleasant now and painful in future,

 - painful now and painful in future,

 - painful now and pleasant in future,

 - pleasant now and pleasant in future.
The Mahādhammasamādāna-sutta, which comes in the Majjhima-nikāya collection
immediately after the Cū�adhammasamādāna-sutta, lists the four ways of undertaking
things in a different sequence:

 - painful now and painful in future,

 - pleasant now and painful in future,

 - painful now and pleasant in future,

 - pleasant now and pleasant in future.
In fact, sequential variations can even occur within a single discourse. The Sāmagāma-sutta begins by listing seven ways of settling a litigation in a sequence that is also
observed in other instances in the Pāli canon that take up these seven ways, which are:

 - confrontation with the teachings,

 - declaration of innocence,

 - past insanity,

 - confession,

 - decision by majority,

 - prevarication by a monk of bad character,

 - covering over a communal litigation. [87]
The actual exposition of these seven in the Sāmagāma-sutta, however, adopts a different sequence, as it has “decision by majority” already as its second item, whereas in
the initial listing this takes the fifth position. [88]
This shows the degree to which within the same textual collection and even within a
single discourse variations in sequence can occur. As in the examples surveyed earlier,
in the present instances the sequential changes also do not seem to have any noticeable
effect on the actual teaching and thus appear to be just the type of variation that at times
can result from the vicissitudes of oral transmission.
Given such the frequency of such variations evident from my comparative studies in
the preceding pages, it also becomes clear that the way the discourses have come down
to us cannot be attributed entirely to later levelling. Although no doubt homogenization
and levelling did take place, the above cases show that, even when such levelling would
definitely have been opportune, it was not carried out. This in turn implies that similarities between the early discourses cannot be attributed to later levelling only.

Conclusion   •   877


Summing up the main points of my exploration in the present section:

 - recurrent references in the discourses and the Vinaya reflect the concerns of an
ongoing oral transmission, in particular an awareness of the need to remember
texts correctly;

 - the early Buddhist oral transmission differed in several respects from its Vedic
counterpart, which was based on memorizing texts whose meaning was often not
understood;

 - modern research into textual memory has shown that memorizing what one has
not understood can result in a remarkably precise recall, whereas in the case of
material that is understood, the reconstructing activity of the mind tends to influence the way one remembers;

 - the effect of such reconstruction can be seen in comparative studies of parallel
versions of a discourse, which often evidence variations in the sequence of the
same set of topics or themes.


The Influence of Commentarial Notions and Tales

In my study of the Majjhima-nikāya discourses I found, besides variations in sequence,
a number of cases where material appears to have been added at a later stage to a discourse. In order to appreciate the dynamics behind such occurrences, in what follows I
take a closer look at the relationship between a discourse and the explanations and commentaries that would have grown up in relation to a discourse during oral transmission.
The interrelationship between commentary and original text can be best seen in the
case of the code of rules (pātimokkha/prātimok�a), which probably belongs to the earliest stratum of oral material in the Buddhist tradition, as its recitation was required for
the performance of the observance day in any monastic settlement. In the way they
have come down in the Pāli Vinaya’s Suttavibha�ga, the pātimokkha rules are embedded in their commentary, which itself attained canonical status. [89] The regular recitation
of the pātimokkha at fortnightly meetings could well have set a model for oral recitation, [90] so that the development that can be seen in the Suttavibha�ga could point to tendencies at work in the early Buddhist oral transmission in general.
While the main rules for monks of the different schools show close resemblances, except for the minor training rules (sekhiya/śaik�a) rules and some sequential variations, [91]


89 On the pātimokkha and its development cf. the detailed study by von Hinüber 1999a.
90 McDermott 1984: 23 suggests that “it is not unreasonable to see in the development of the Pātimokkha
and its liturgical recitation a primary step in the development of Buddhist scripture as form and concept”. Smith 1993: 166 even goes so far as to suggest that “the entire business of having a canonized
scripture was a development out of the monks’ ceremonial repetition fortnightly of a formal confession”; cf. also Wynne 2004: 108.
91 A convenient chart surveying the different versions can be found in Nattier 1977: 268, from which it
becomes readily apparent that variations mainly affect the minor training rules; cf. also Olivelle 1974:

the stories that explain the rationale for these rules in the different Vinayas exhibit major divergences. [92] This pattern may well reflect the distinction between the rules themselves and the narrative and commentarial elaborations that came to be added to these
in the course of transmission.
Another example of a very early ‘commentary’ is the Madhupi��ika-sutta, which
reports a monk explaining in detail a short saying by the Buddha. This ‘commentary’
was later endorsed by the Buddha and thereby received canonical status. [93] Even without explicit approval by the Buddha some of the explanations and comments given by
disciples have come down to us as discourses that are considered canonical. [94]
In fact, the dividing line between the original saying and its commentary may not always have been clear. Nowadays, when speaking of a ‘commentary’, one inevitably has
in mind the A��hakathās and �īkās, which are quite different from the Pāli ‘discourse’
material. But such clear separation would not have been in existence in ancient times. [95]


92 For an examination of some of the inconsistencies found in the background stories given in the Pāli Vinaya, cf. Schlingloff 1963a. He concludes (p. 551) that, whereas the code of rules belongs to the earliest
parts of Buddhist literature, the stories belong to the latest strata of canonical material.
93 [[MN18]] at MN I 114,3 and its parallels [[MA115]] at T I 604c17 and [[EA40.10]] at T II 743c20 report that the
Buddha approved of Mahākaccāna’s exposition as a way of explaining the matter just as the Buddha himself would have done. Goonesekera 1967: 336 comments that, with instances like this discourse, “the
earliest beginnings of exegetical literature can be traced to the canon itself”. Malalasekera 1928/1994:
88-90 notes that explanations given by the early disciples “formed the nucleus of the commentaries”, as
“even during the Master’s lifetime ... discussions ... used to take place ... accounts of these discussions
were duly reported to the Teacher, and some of them were approved by him ... When later the text of the
canon came to be compiled ... some of the expositions found their way into the Pi�akas”. In continuation
of the same tendency, as “the commentaries ... were handed down ... along with the texts themselves ...
parts of the commentaries came later to be attached to the texts which they interpreted”. Mayer 2004:
166 even traces the beginnings of the commentaries to the Buddha himself, indicating that “the teachings of the dharma, from the very beginning, called for commentary ... the Buddha was frequently called
upon to elaborate on teachings he had given”; cf. also Skilling 2009b: 53, who points out that “the transmission of the Buddha’s teaching ... evidently started during the Buddha’s lifetime ... [and] continued
throughout his teaching career, during which the practice of commentary began ... monks and nuns explained and amplified the statements of the Master”.
94 Bond 1975: 409 comments that “the concept of ‘the word of the Buddha’ was a formal category or a
theory which did not necessarily mean the Buddha actually spoke these words, but [only that] they conformed in some way to what was taken to be the basic lines of his teachings”. Mizuno 1982: 21 points
out that discourses delivered “by authors both human and non-human were still regarded as the teaching
of the Buddha because” these “were reported to the Buddha, who verified their accuracy”; cf. also MacQueen 1981 and Skilling 2010. The recurrence of such instances is noteworthy not only in that it shows
the relatively broad scope of what was considered “canonical” in ancient times, but also in showing that
the early reciters did not simply attribute such sayings to the Buddha. Weller 1928a: 144 remarks that
this is significant, since in view of the fact that the discourses were considered to be ‘Buddha word’ by
the reciters, it would have been natural for them to attribute all discourses to the Buddha.
95 Cutler 1992: 549 explains that “in traditional Indian culture a literary composition is rarely if ever appreciated as a self-contained ‘text in itself’. To the contrary, texts are almost always embedded in contexts ... that either explicitly or implicitly contain elements of commentary”. Similarly, Deutsch 1988:
170-171 reports that in the Indian setting commentaries are seen as “not so much appendages to an

A case in point can be found in the A�guttara-nikāya, where a monk is asked if what
he has just taught was spoken by the Buddha. [96] In reply, the monk answers with the
dictum that “whatever is well said is the Buddha’s word”. [97] The context and the simile
he uses make it clear that with this dictum he is not intending to pass off his own explanation as the Buddha’s word, but only that he considers the Buddha to be the real
source of whatever he has been expounding. [98]
Just as with the Madhupi��ika-sutta, this discourse has come down as a canonical
discourse, in this case even without an explicit endorsement by the Buddha. This shows
how explanations delivered by disciples could nevertheless become part of what tradition regards as canonical. [99]


otherwise fixed and complete work”, but rather as a contribution “to a larger, developing work”, in the
sense that “from the ... commentator’s point of view he is not so much remarking on an already finished
text”, but instead “he is himself contributing to that text”; cf. also Jyväsjärvi 2010: 138 on the importance
given in the Jain tradition to commentarial exegesis as that which enables the root text to perform its
soteriological function. Warder 1961b: 52 suggests that, in the Buddhist case, during the first period of
transmission there was “no clear line of demarcation between the Canonical traditions and the Commentarial extensions of them”.
96 According to [[AN8.8]] at AN IV 163,6, it was Sakka who had come in person to ask this question, so that,
as Arunasiri 2006: 634 notes, “Sakka is presented as supervising what the monks were preaching”. That
is, according to this discourse even the gods would intervene in order to ensure that the teachings were
passed on correctly, yet another reflection of the recurrent concern in the discourse with ensuring their
own correct transmission.
97 [[AN8.8]] at AN IV 164,7: ya� kiñci subhāsita�, sabba� ta� tassa bhagavato vacana� (Se-AN IV 166,6:
ya�).
98 Another interesting aspect of this discourse is that, according to [[AN8.8]] at AN IV 164,15, Sakka informed the monk that what the monk had been teaching had indeed been delivered by the Buddha on a
former occasion, but this teaching had not been preserved by any member of the four assemblies, [[AN8.8]]
at AN IV 166,7. Sakka then tells the monk that he should make an effort to preserve this teaching. Thus
according to this discourse, a teaching originally given by the Buddha had been lost, but was then restored to the oral transmission thanks to an intervention by Sakka. This could point to the beginnings of
tendencies found more explicitly in the account in Tāranātha’s History of Buddhism in Schiefner 1868:
50,14 (translated in Chattopadhyaya 1970/2004: 98 or Schiefner 1869: 63), according to which certain
sūtras originated from the nāga realm, as well as from devas, gandharvas, and rāk�asas.
99 In the Śik�āsamuccaya in Bendall 1902/1970: 15,19, the phrase “whatever is well said is the Buddha’s
word” reappears in the context of a defence of the authenticity of later scriptures; cf. also Collins 1990:
94, Lamotte 1944/1981: 80 note 2, Lopez 1995: 27, MacQueen 1981: 314, McDermott 1984: 29, Ruegg
1995: 180, Snellgrove 1958: 620, and Williams 1991: 31. For another occurrence of this dictum in a
rock edict by Aśoka cf. Bloch 1950: 154 or Woolner 1924/1993: 32. Silk 2008: 276 remarks that “the
early Buddhist tag line ‘all that is spoken by the Buddha is well spoken’ is later transformed into ‘all
that is well spoken is spoken by the Buddha’. With hermeneutic strategies likes this, strict consistency
need not be expected from the scriptural corpora”. The Atthasālinī even extends the category of “the
word of the Buddha” to the Kathāvatthu, explaining that the Buddha had already laid down the contents
of this work with the foresight that 218 years after his demise Moggaliputta Tissa would give a full exposition of it, cf. [[BU-AS4.24]] Notably, the Kathāvatthu is mentioned in the account of the third council in
the Samantapāsādikā at Sp I 61,13, but not in the account of the same council in the in T
1462 at T XXIV 684b10; cf. also Guruge 2005: 106, Lamotte 1958/1988: 273, and Sujāto 2006: 133.

Now, a distinctive feature of oral traditions in general is that the recited material is
part of what could be called a ‘performance’. [100] A ‘performance’ in the sense that a reciter will be surrounded by a circle of listeners, who participate in what the reciter communicates. While delivering a particular teaching in such a performance situation,
reciters will also provide explanations of passages that require elucidation and narrate
tales that fill out the background to the particular event they are presenting. [101]
From the viewpoint of transmission, a key factor is the intention of the reciter during
such performance. In the case of a popular storytelling, for example, a reciter has considerable freedom in adapting the material to suit the audience and the situation. However, when the main task of the reciters is to faithfully repeat what they have learned, a
fair degree of consistency in the oral material becomes their chief target. [102]
This would have been the case in the transmission of the early discourses, in the sense
that the reciting monks and nuns would have attempted to present the word of the Buddha correctly, as they had learned it. The various tools employed to ensure precision,
surveyed in the introduction to my study, make it clear that in the early Buddhist oral
tradition the emphasis was on precise repetition.
However, although the reciters would have attempted to achieve precision with the
texts they considered to be the word of the Buddha, more freedom for expressing their
own understanding would have been possible when providing explanations and commentaries on what they considered the ‘word of the Buddha’ during an actual performance situation. In other words, personal ideas and changing viewpoints in an oral transmission would naturally have first taken the form of a ‘commentary’, which might
either draw out the doctrinal implication of a particular word or statement, or provide
additional narrative details related to an event or a protagonist of the discourse that is
the object of the oral performance. [103]


100 Vansina 1985: 34 points out that “the crucial link is the performance. Only the performance makes the

[oral] tradition perceptible and at the same time only a performance is the source of the ensuing text.
The peculiarities of the text derive from the relationship it has to ... performance”.
101 The degree to which illustration may have been part of such ‘performance’ can be seen in the suggestion by Ray 1994/1995: 350, that “in view of the tradition of picture recitation in ancient India, it is ...
possible that scrolls were also utilized by the bhanakas to provide visual stimulus ... a tradition that
persists to the present times ... it has been argued that the toranas at Sanchi depicting scenes from the
life of the Buddha represented scrolls. It is possible that these long horizontal panels ... are a transference to stone of popular picture scrolls partly unrolled for exhibition”; cf. also Hoffman 1992: 196. In
fact, a reference to the employment of pictures in an oral performance situation can be found in [[SN22.100]] at SN III 151,24, which speaks of the cara�a� nāma citta�, which the commentary at Spk II
327,18 explains as referring to a canvas with various paintings taken around by wandering Brahmins to
illustrate the teachings they delivered on karma and its fruits; cf. also Brown 1997: 81, Dehejia 1990:
377, and Mair 1988: 17-37. Another example can be found in the Divyāvadāna in Cowell 1886: 300,8
or in Vaidya 1999: 185,26, which reports the Buddha instructing the monks to fashion a pictorial representation of the five gatis; cf. also above p. 114 note 79.
102 Vansina 1985: 41: “where ... the performers intend to stick as closely as possible to the message related
and to avoid lapses of memory or distortions, the pace of change can almost be stopped”.
103 Extracts from the present discussion have already been published in Anālayo 2010g.


Conclusion   •   881


A large part of the commentaries, as we have them now, consists of glosses on particular expressions or circumstances. These would have needed to be brought in very
soon after the appearance of the expressions or circumstances in question. [104] That is,
when reciting a discourse to an audience, the reciter would have needed to alternate
between portions of the discourse and comments upon it. Especially in the case of a
longer discourse, reciting the whole discourse first, without interruption, would run the
risk that the audience no longer has clearly in mind the passages to which the commentary refers. Thus, the oral performance situation would have required the discourse to
be interspersed with explanations of a commentarial nature. [105]

104 Griffiths 1999: 55 points out that a “religious commentary will take as its initial object ... gobbets” and
“a comment on any one of these gobbets will typically presuppose knowledge of them all, and may be
incomprehensible without such knowledge”.
105 Norman 1997: 158-160, however, holds that the discourses and the commentaries were passed on separately. He bases this suggestion on his observation that the commentaries at times preserve explanations
no longer meaningful, owing to changes in the language of the discourses, such as, for example, the explanation of the name of King Pasenadi at Ud-[[AN104.27]] “he defeats the army of others”, parasena� jinātī ti. This explanation only makes sense with a form of the king’s name that has a j, as in the Sanskrit
form Prasenajit, but not with the Pāli form Pasenadi (Lüders 1954: 100 notes that a Bhārhut inscription
reads rājā pasenaji kosalo, which would fit the above etymology well). Norman 1997: 158 reasons that
“the fact that the commentary explains the syllable -di by jināti, shows that the text and the cty were
transmitted separately, with neither having an effect upon the other”, “they were in the keeping of different groups, i.e. the bhā�akas responsible for the canonical text were not also responsible for the safe
keeping of the commentary upon that text”. Yet, it seems not particularly surprising that the old commentarial explanation parasena� jināti, stemming from a time when the name of Pasenadi was still
pronounced with a j, continued to be passed on even though in the meantime the spelling of his name
had gradually come to be Pasenadi. In fact, the Nikāyas themselves preserve explanations that, owing to
language developments, are no longer meaningful, such as [[DHP|DHP388]] bāhita pāpo ti brāhma�o (on which
cf. above p. 542 note 71). As Norman 1997: 160 notes, this explanation “shows that in the dialect in
which the etymology was invented the word brāhma�a had the form bāha�a”. If the discourses continued to pass on an explanation that no longer fits the development of the language, the fact that the commentaries did the same appears to be simply a sign of the fidelity of the tradition. There seems to be no
need to assume that such commentarial explanations could only continue to exist if they were passed on
separately from the discourses. In the case of the commentarial gloss on the name Pasenadi, the assumption of an independent transmission would in fact not solve the problem, since the name Pasenadi
occurs also in the commentarial gloss itself, which reads parasena� jinātī ti pasenadi. That is, even if
the commentators did not know the discourse at all, the wording of the commentary would have ensured that they knew the term Pasenadi and thus should have realized the inapplicability of an explanation that involved instead a j. Nevertheless, they continued to transmit an explanation that no longer
suited the term it purports to explain. Hence, it seems safe to conclude that the old commentarial explanation parasena� jinātī ti continued to be passed on in deference to tradition, even though its etymology no longer made as much sense as it would have made originally (cf. also Balbir 1991: 123, who in
a discussion of such popular ‘etymologies’ explains that “les commentateurs sont aussi des fidèles ... il
n’y a donc pas chez eux d’attitude ‘critique’ eu égard à la justesse ou à la fantaisie d’une explication”).
Another point to be considered in the present context is that, e.g., Pj I 151,12 lists the a��hakathikas
alongside those who specialize in the suttas, the Vinaya, the Abhidharma, or the Jātakas (cf. also Mori
1983: 980). Such listings appear to reflect some degree of specialization and need not be taken to imply
that the a��hakathikas knew only the commentaries and had no knowledge of the source material which

This basic pattern, where an oral performance combines a fixed part (often in verse,
but at times also in prose) with a commentary that is of a more fluctuating nature and
allows for some degree of improvisation on the part of the reciter, seems to stretch all
the way from Vedic ākhyāna to the modern day kavi ba�a in Sri Lanka. [106]
A reciter would know which parts were comments made by himself, but once the
discourse with commentary had been passed on to his disciples, and then to their disciples, the formerly clear distinction between what was originally discourse and what
commentary may not always have remained clear. To further explore this possibility,
let me turn again to the findings of modern psychology on textual memory.
As I mentioned above in relation to the working mechanics of textual memory, information to be remembered is stored in the mind together with inferences made by the
reader or listener. The problem with this process of drawing inferences is that it often
takes place without being consciously noticed. [107] Inferences are stored in memory together with the original material and on recall one is at times unable to distinguish between what was originally read or heard and what was only inferred. [108] That is, what is
remembered is a mixture of the original data and the elaborations added by the recipient. [109] This leaves considerable room for the influence of the recipient’s knowledge and
attitude on the remembered information. [110]


the commentaries were meant to explain. In fact, much of the commentaries becomes meaningful only
when the text on which they comment is also known. Moreover, as noted by Endo 2003b: 36, the commentaries also refer to akkharabhā�akas, vyañjanabhā�akas, va��abhā�akas, and padabhā�akas (on
which cf. also Palihawadana 1997: 502), which he explains as referring to reciters that specialize in phonetics, letters (as against meaning), praises, and in syllables or sentences respectively. Similar to the
case of the a��hakathikas, it would not seem meaningful to assume that these specialists knew only phonetics, or only letters, etc. Clearly, they would have been acquainted with the texts in addition to being
well versed in the particular area of their specialization, cf. also ibid. pp. 3-4.
106 On the Vedic ākhyāna cf., e.g., Alsdorf 1974; on the kavi ba�a cf., e.g., Mahinda 2003; cf. also id.
1998 on the ‘two-pulpit’ preaching tradition and Schalk 1983: 87 on the ‘yugāsana ba�a’ in Sri Lanka.
According to Kanno 2003: 302, the early Chinese commentaries were also given in an interlinear form
and only later a style of commentary developed that was more independent of the original discourse; cf.
also Mayer 2004: 167-168.
107 Bransford 1973: 391 explains that “processes of making inferences ... occur quite frequently in the normal course of comprehending. Generally, we may not be aware of them”. Eysenck 1992/2005: 377
points out that “it is so natural for us to draw inferences that we are often unaware that we are doing
so”.
108 Harley 1995/1996: 234 explains that “inferences are confused with original material because the propositions created as a result of inferences are stored along with explicitly presented propositions, and
the two sorts of propositions are indistinguishable”. According to Rosenberg 1987: 83, “inferences are
stored, and when recalled, often mistaken for ... the original sentence. A major source of confusion is
people’s inclination to integrate new information ... before storing, at recall it is often difficult to remember which pieces of information were acquired when. All known facts regarding a single entity are
clustered around a ‘single point’ and that organization controls recall”.
109 Kintsch 1994: 732 explains that “the mental representation of a text contains not only information derived from the text, but also knowledge elaborations from the reader’s long term memory”.
110 Sanford 1994: 717 has been able to show that “if a text statement fits well with a piece of pre-estab

Conclusion   •   883


Not only is it often no longer possible, on recall, to draw a clear line between the original data and what has only been imagined, [111] but memory of something that was only
imagined may end up being so vivid that it is taken to be real beyond any doubt. [112] Consequently, when one ‘remembers’, it is often difficult, at times even impossible, to distinguish the original from the inference.
Now, the drawing of inferences and the providing of additional explanations to aid
comprehension is precisely the task of the commentaries. To judge from modern research findings on the way textual memory works, it could easily have happened that,
during oral transmission, material of a commentarial nature was confused with the material on which it was commenting. In what follows, I survey several examples that
seem to testify to this pattern.
According to the Ga�akamoggallāna-sutta of the Majjima-nikāya, the advice given
by the Buddha is supreme among “teachings of today”. [113] The Pāli commentary explains that “teachings of today” refers to the six heterodox teachers (i.e., Pūra�a Kassapa, etc.). [114] The corresponding passage in the two Chinese parallels to the Ga�akamoggallāna-sutta proclaims that the Buddha’s teaching is able to subdue all heterodox
wanderers, [115] thereby expressing an understanding that corresponds to the Pāli commentarial gloss and thus could have resulted from the influence of a similarly worded
ancient Indian commentary.
The Aggivacchagotta-sutta of the Majjhima-nikāya reports an inquiry by the wanderer Vacchagotta about the destiny of a Tathāgata after death. [116] A Sa�yukta-āgama
parallel to this discourse speaks instead of the destiny of the “self of beings”, which
does not fit the context. [117] The reference to the self of beings parallels an explanation
found in the Pāli commentarial tradition, which glosses occurrences of the word Tathāgata in the context of this type of inquiry as referring to a “living being”. [118] Thus, the
puzzling reference in the Chinese version could be due to the influence of an ancient

lished knowledge” it is remembered in this perspective “even if there are details of a local nature which
are inconsistent with that interpretation”. Thus, “processing in the service of cohesion establishment is
both selective and incomplete”.
111 The inability to distinguish between originally perceived information and mental imaginations has been
researched by Johnson 1979, who (p. 239) indicates that a confusion between original data and mental
imagination appears to occur more easily with words to be remembered than with recalling more complex phenomena such as pictures.
112 Roediger 1996: 85 notes that “subjects apparently experience the recollection of ... events that never
happened as quite real, as real as the recall of the word events that actually had occurred. ‘False memories’ may be a misnomer, at least from the subject’s viewpoint, because the experience of recollecting
the critical non-presented words appears as real to the subjects as their recollections of the presented
words”.

884   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


Indian commentarial explanation similar to what is now preserved in the Pāli commentaries.
Examples of what could be the influence of commentarial exegesis occur not only in
parallels to the Majjhima-nikāya. One such case can be found in the Dīrgha-āgama
counterpart to the Brahmajāla-sutta of the Dīgha-nikāya. Both versions report that the
Buddha had become aware of the fact that a group of monks had been having a discussion. While the Dīgha-nikāya simply mentions that, when the Buddha joined the monks,
he sat down and asked them what they had been talking about, [119] the commentary clarifies that he asked this question even though he knew what their discussion had been
about. [120] This is made explicit in the Dīrgha-āgama discourse itself, which indicates
that the Buddha inquired from the monks “knowingly”. [121]
Another example can be found in relation to the Kassapagotta-sutta of the Sa�yuttanikāya. The introductory narration of the Pāli version of this discourse reports that the
monk Kassapagotta admonished a hunter. [122] The commentary then furnishes the additional information that the person in question was a deer hunter. [123] The parallel passages in versions of this discourse found in the two Sa�yukta-āgama translations go a
step further, since they describe that the hunter was actually setting up a trap to catch
deer on that occasion. [124]
The above examples suggest that during the process of oral transmission a commentarial gloss, being itself probably part of a body of widely accepted popular interpretation, could become part of the discourse itself.
This hypothesis would also fit the finding of a mixture of two different textual styles
in works such as the Divyāvadāna, the Lalitavistara, and the Mahāvastu. These two
textual styles comprise an “old style”, similar to the Pāli discourses, and a “new style”,
more akin in form and content to later works and the Pāli commentaries. [125] Instances of a
mixture of these two styles could well be the result of combining earlier texts with elaborations of an originally commentarial nature. [126]

Conclusion   •   885


The same explanatory model would also be applicable to an instance where the school
affiliation of the reciters appears to have influenced the wording of a discourse, namely
the case of the Madhyama-āgama parallel to the Mahākaccānabhaddekaratta-sutta.
Unlike its Pāli counterpart, the Madhyama-āgama discourse qualifies sense-organs of
the past as “truly” existent, [127] which appears to reflect the influence of the Sarvāstivāda
tenet that past and future phenomena truly exist. Yet, when it comes to sense-organs of
the future, the same Madhyama-āgama discourse does not employ this qualification. If
the application of the qualification to be “truly” existent had been the outcome of conscious editing, the same qualification would also have been applied to the future case.
The same would hold true if this qualification was part of a gloss added at the time of
translation, since once the translators had decided to incorporate this gloss, they would
have naturally applied it to the future as well.
Hence, the most natural explanation of the present condition of the Madhyama-āgama presentation is that the qualification “truly” is the outcome of a somewhat accidental type of change. Perhaps a Sarvāstivāda commentary on the true existence of senseorgans in past and future times arose alongside the discourse, a portion of which then
became part of the discourse during the process of transmission.
Now, of the various commentaries on the early discourses that would have been extant in India, with minor exceptions only those of the Theravāda tradition have been
preserved fully. For this reason, parallelism between a particular discourse version and
a commentary from a different tradition can be easily documented only in cases where
a Chinese Āgama discourse parallels a Pāli commentarial passage.
However, the hypothesis that during the process of oral transmission commentarial
material could become part of a discourse would also explain some passages in Majjhima-nikāya discourses, even without having direct access to the commentaries on the
respective parallel versions. [128]
One example is the long exposition of various aspects of the Buddhist path given in
the Mahāsakuludāyi-sutta, an exposition that is missing from its Chinese parallel. [129]
Both discourses refer to the path to liberation, which may have led to the arising of a
more detailed explanation of all the other aspects of the path in the form of a commentary that then made its way into the Pāli discourse.
Another example is the exposition of the supramundane path factors found in the
Mahācattārīsaka-sutta. [130] Although the parallel versions do not have such an exposition, an otherwise unrelated discourse in the Sa�yukta-āgama also presents the path
factors in supramundane perspective. [131] Hence, the Mahācattārīsaka-sutta and the

Sa�yukta-āgama discourse appear to have both been influenced by similar elaborations on the path factors in the style of the emerging Abhidharma, which may well
have arisen in the course of commenting on the discourse.
A similar pattern could also be responsible for the additional description of various
ways of purifying a monk’s alms food given in the Pi��apātapārisuddhi-sutta, which
is absent from its Sa�yukta-āgama parallel. [132] Here, too, it seems that, what may originally have been a commentarial gloss, giving additional information on how a monk
may purify his alms food, eventually became part of the discourse.
Not only certain words or parts of a discourse, but at times entire prose sections appear to be later additions of a commentarial nature. This can be seen, for example, in
the Udāna collection, whose verses are embedded in prose narrations that often appear
to have been added at a later time. [133] In contrast, most of the Udāna collections preserved in other traditions are entirely in verse, giving the impression that, in these traditions, whatever narrations would have accompanied the verses in an actual performance situation were still considered commentarial. [134]
Another instance of the same pattern is the A��haka-vagga of the Sutta-nipāta. In this
case, it is the Pāli version that has only verses, whereas background stories, such as the
tale of the murder of Sundarī, are found in the Pāli commentary. The Chinese translation
of the A��haka-vagga, however, combines verse with prose narrations similar to those
found in the Pāli commentary. [135] Thus, its version of the tale of Sundarī has become part
of the discourse itself, [136] a status this tale has also acquired in the Pāli Udāna collection. [137]
In sum, the actual performance situation of the early Buddhist oral reciters, when
teaching a diverse audience, would often have demanded the employment of commentarial explanations alongside the recited material, explanations that in the course of
transmission at times appear to have become part of the source material itself.
Notably, differences between parallel versions tend to affect more often the narrative
portions of the text, which are the parts that were more prominently “commentarial”


132 [[MN151]] at MN III 295,13; cf. also above p. 848.
133 This has already been pointed out by, e.g., Abeynayake 1984: 66, Ireland 1990b: 7, Lamotte 1968: 465,
Nakamura 1980/1999: 43, Norman 1983a: 61, Pande 1957: 72, Seidenstücker 1920: xvi, von Hinüber
1996/1997: 46, Winternitz 1920/1968: 67, and Woodward 1935: v. For a more detailed study of the
relationship between prose and verse in the Udāna cf. Anālayo 2009e.
134 For a survey of the different Udāna collections cf. Anālayo 2008i.
135 These instances corroborate a pattern described by Norman 1980: 179, who suggests that “when the
Buddhist sects began to separate they already had a commentarial tradition together with their canonical texts, but ... what some regarded as canonical others kept as commentarial, and vice versa”. The
same pattern can also be found in Vinaya texts, where Shih 2008: 93, based on a case study of one
particular regulation, reports that “discussions contained in the Chinese canonical texts appear not in
the Pāli canon, but in its post-canonical commentaries”.

incorporate the background stories, similar to the Chinese version.

and thus more directly open to the influence of the reciters. [138] In contrast, what would
have been considered by the reciters to be the word of the Buddha appears to have been
more resistant to change. [139]


138 The lack of concern for accuracy in narrative passages finds its perhaps most explicit expression in a
passage in the Mahāsā�ghika and (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinayas, which instruct that if a monk has forgotten the location of a discourse, he should allocate the discourse to Sāvatthī or another of the main
places where the Buddha frequently stayed, cf. T 1425 at T XXII 497a6 and T 1451 at T XXIV 328c15
and T XXIV 575b29; for the corresponding passage in the Tibetan (Mūla-)Sarvāstivāda Vinaya, together with a discussion, cf. Schopen 1997/2004: 395-407; cf. also id. 1998/2004: 283 note 59. This instruction is also found in the introduction to the Ekottarika-āgama, T II 550b13; cf. also the
, T 1507 at T XXV 33b19. Regarding such instructions, Scharfe 2002: 25 note 93 comments that “it
is worth noting that no such ‘creativeness’ was allowed where the contents of the lesson is concerned”.
The lack of concern for ‘historical’ details evident in these instructions does indeed contrast with the
much greater care with which the doctrinal teachings in the discourses are transmitted. As Cousins
1983: 5 notes, between the various versions of a discourse “divergences are typically greatest in matters
of little importance – such ... as the locations of suttas” (cf. also Lenz 2003: 17, who notes that “in comparative studies of sūtra and vinaya texts ... material is found to vary marginally in terms of content, but
widely in ordering and arrangement”). Carrithers 1983a: 9 notes that “the ancient Indians ... were very
little interested in chronology but much exercised over philosophy. Hence we are in the paradoxical
situation of having a better idea of what the Buddha thought than of what century he lived in”. Coward 分別功
1986: 305 comments that 德論 “the early Buddhists shared ... the Indian indifference to historical details.
Historical events surrounding a text are judged to be unimportant in relation to the unchanging truth the
text contains”. De Jong 1979b: 142 notes that the information on the location of a discourse is considerably less well established in the tradition than the text itself (“par rapport au nidāna, l’exposition du
lieu de l’action, la tradition est souvent beaucoup moins bien établie que par rapport au texte même”).
Gokhale 1994/2001f: 1 notes that “the Buddha does not indulge in ‘low’ talk (tiracchānakathā – literally animal talk) ... [such as] tales of kings and their high ministers, armies and wars ... now precisely
these are the stuff out of which the chronicles of history are made”, which makes it only natural that the
early Buddhist tradition was not too concerned about ‘historical facts’. Gombrich 1990b: 22 comments
that “from the religious point of view this is perfectly understandable: the narrative framework of the
sayings is not relevant to salvation”. According to Pollock 1989: 610, behind the ancient Indian attitude
towards historical details stands “a model of ‘truth’ that accorded history no epistemological value or
social significance”. Rhys Davids 1899: 207 notes that “the doctrine taught loomed so much larger than
anything else”, as the monks responsible for the texts were “necessarily more concerned with that, than
with any historical accuracy in the details of the story”. Williams 1970: 166-167 points out that “the
oral transmission of teaching is generally more conservative than that of narrative material” so that “it
is likely that the teaching is a more accurate reflection of the oldest tradition than the narrative”. In fact,
the introductory section of a discourse, which specifies the location, etc., is clearly of a more commentarial nature than the main body of the discourse itself, since this is material that was added by the reciters.
139 As I mentioned earlier, cf. above p. 502 note 303, von Simson 1977: 484 found that in the Sarvāstivāda
tradition there is a strong tendency to replace phrases of the type yena ... tenopasa�krānta� with yena ...
tenopajagāma. Yet, in places where this expression is used in direct speech by the Buddha (i.e., the Buddha reports how someone came to see him) the old form remains. Von Simson concludes that this shows
the respect the reciters had for what they perceived as the word of the Buddha, which was kept in the old
form, while parts of the discourses not held to have been spoken by the Buddha could more easily be
changed.


888   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


Summing up the main points of this part of the present chapter:

 - oral recitation of a discourse for teaching purposes would have required explanatory comments;

 - modern research on textual memory shows that such explanations could in the
course of time be mistaken as having been part of the original;

 - the result of such confusion of sources can be seen in instances where canonical
versions of a discourse appear to have incorporated material that could have
originally been a commentarial type of explanation.

Bringing together the different strands of my exploration in this final chapter of my
study of the Majjhima-nikāya, the overall picture that suggests itself is that the early
Buddhist oral transmission went through a gradual development, which led to the differences found between parallel versions. [140] This much is fully in line with what is only
natural for orally transmitted material. Radical changes would in fact have been difficult to implement practically, since this would have required influencing an oral tradition passed on communally by groups of reciters spread out over various parts of India. [141]
Such gradual change, reflecting changing circumstances and times, would have been
nearly inevitable, given the nature of human memory and the specific characteristics of
the early Buddhist oral transmission. Instances of change would at first probably have
manifested in explanations given alongside the recital of a discourse. [142 ] Over time, such
a commentary could then have become so much a part of the oral tradition of the discourse to which it belonged that sections of it ended up becoming part of the discourse
itself.
The general tendency of the early Buddhist monastics towards an increasingly sedentary life style would have contributed to the formation of local reciter groups, who
would have learned and then recited the discourses in the way their particular teacher
remembered them. [143] Other reciters, who lived a more migratory life style and thus be
140 Gombrich 1990b: 26 suggests that “changes must have been mostly unintentional, due to lapses of
memory and to the contamination of texts as someone’s memory slipped from one text to another”,
whereas “any text which ... introduces something which is palpably new has no chance of survival”. In
a similar vein, Norman 1997: 92 clarifies that “there was no way of inserting an entirely new sutta into
a nikāya unless the bhā�akas of the nikāya could be persuaded to accept it ... nor would it be possible
... even after the introduction of the use of writing, as long as the bhā�aka tradition continued alongside
writing”. Scharfe 2002: 36 notes that “traditional Buddhist texts were handed down orally and their validity and correctness were constantly reaffirmed by group recitation of the monks; making additions to
the canon ... difficult if not impossible”.
141 Gombrich 2003: 9 comments on the Buddhist canon that “it is inconceivable that this large body of material could have been composed and agreed on as authentic once Buddhism had spread over a large
geographical area, as we know it did under the emperor Asoka. The common textual heritage must
therefore date back to within about 150 years of the Buddha’s death”.
142 By the time of the Visuddhimagga, the commentaries were perceived as such an integral part of the
transmission that even a monk who knew the Tripi�aka was apparently not allowed to deliver teachings
until he had also studied the commentaries, cf. Vism 96,8.
143 The (Mūla-)sarvāstivāda Vinaya, T 1451 at T XXIV 409c26, reports an occasion when Ānanda corrected

came exposed to various reciter lineages from different localities, would then have come
across recitations of the same discourses with several variations.
An overall survey of the situation in ancient India at any given point in time would
probably have shown a considerable degree of heterogeneity, as is typical of oral traditions in general. [144]
Discourses would have been recited with variations, with one detail becoming lost
here and another detail being corrected there during a communal recitation, etc. [145] With
increasing geographical separation, the variations to be found would have increased
correspondingly.

a monk who was reciting a verse wrongly. When this monk reported the matter to his teacher, he was
told to continue reciting as he had learned it and not to worry about what Ānanda said (cf. also the version of this tale in Xuánzàng's ( ) travel records, T 2087 at T LI 909c14, translated in Beal 1884/
2001b: 76, in T 2006 at T XLVIII 305a18, T 2035 at T XLIX 171a18, T 2058 at T L 302c2, T 2078 at T
LI 720a16, and in Bu ston’s “History of Buddhism” in Obermiller 1932/1986: 87; cf. also the comments
on this incident by Brough 1962/2001: 45-48). This tale, whatever its historical accuracy, shows that
variations were seen as being easily perpetuated because of the typical Indian respect for one’s teacher.
144 Cf. Vansina 1985: 161. In the case of the early Buddhist oral tradition, Davidson 1990/1992: 293 suggests that such heterogeneity was probably characteristic of the situation from its very outset, as “during the more than forty years of the Buddha’s teaching career, there were many monks acting as authoritative teachers of the doctrine throughout the kingdom of Magadha and its border areas. They
would cross paths with the master from time to time and receive new information as his doctrine and
teaching style developed. They would also receive new information from one another during the fort- 玄奘
nightly congregations, the summer rains retreats, and whenever they met as their mendicant paths
crossed. After forty years of their obtaining new information through such contact, we may be certain
that, by the death of the Buddha, the process of receiving new ‘teachings of the teacher’ (śāstu� śāsana�) had become a well-accepted practice. The network of instruction was thus established, and doubtless most of the monks realized that much of what the Buddha had said during his lengthy career remained unknown to them personally. They therefore kept the network alive to obtain instruction committed to other bhik�us. In my opinion, this was the beginning of the continuing cross-fertilization of
scripture and doctrine which was the hallmark of Indian Buddhism”. Cox 2004b: 502 points out that an
explicit reference to such heterogeneity can be found in the account of the first sa�gīti, according to
which “Purā�a rejected the consensual understanding of the Buddha’s teaching and preferred instead to
transmit it as Purā�a himself had heard it”; cf. also Seidenstücker 1913: 77-78. As Bechert 1973: 7
notes, this episode points to the existence of “an historical kernel in the traditions concerning the First
Buddhist Council”. Ray 1985: 154-155 sums up that, “given the Buddha’s ... approach to the question
of religious authority, the extensiveness of his own teaching [and] the considerable geographical extent
of Buddhism at the time of his death ... uniformity in determination of buddha-vacana and of the canon
was virtually ruled out”.
145 Allon 1997a: 366 points out that, although “communal or group recitation ... requires fixed wording”,
“there is, however, scope for considerable change to occur within a tradition of the transmission of
fixed, memorized text. Monks were ... living in remote regions ... a dominant, centralised authority
seems to have been absent. Accuracy in the transmission of a fixed text would have depended to a large
extent on the number of monks available to reinforce the ‘correct’ version and on the authority of the
teacher. And surely what the teacher taught, his pupils would have taken as authoritative. Differences
in the order in which certain episodes or events occur within different versions of the same text and
whether or not they are included could occur under such circumstances, as could differences in wording
generally”.


890   • A Comparative Study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_


Eventually whole discourses would probably have been lost in some parts of India
and only been preserved in other parts of the country. Out of the range of lineages of
the early Buddhist oral transmission that would have been in existence at any given
time, those versions that were eventually preserved for posterity reflect those peculiar
errors and omissions or additions that had occurred in their particular line of transmission.
Once the dynamics of oral transmission and the limitations of human memory are
taken into account, it becomes clear why the discourses of the Majjhima-nikāya and
their parallels exhibit numerous differences in details alongside considerable agreement in regard to essential teachings. In this way, my research confirms that these
discourses are indeed the final products of a genuine oral transmission, with all its vicissitudes, but also with all its strengths. [146]
My comparative study of the Majjhima-nikāya discourses also shows that it would be
a gross oversimplification if one were to side with one particular tradition as the more
authentic one. [147] Nothing short of a detailed examination of each individual text in the
light of all of its extant parallels can lead to a proper assessment of the reliability of a
particular passage or statement and of its significance within the overall picture of
early Buddhist thought, in as much as this has been preserved in textual records.


146 Bareau 1974b: 277-280 explains that the idea of a conspiracy of the early monks to introduce a change
in the teaching arose at a time when scholarship was aware only of the Pāli canon, whereas comparative studies of the parallel material preserved in Chinese, Pāli, and Sanskrit show that this hypothesis is
not convincing. He also notes that it is not only inconceivable that the first generation of disciples consciously altered the teachings, but also that during the later stages of Buddhist history, which saw endless time spent in discussion on minor points of Buddhist doctrine among the different schools, such a
move would most certainly have been criticized, if it had ever taken place. He concludes that the Buddhism lived and preached by the Buddha and his disciples is, in its main lines, what we find in the early
canonical texts preserved in Chinese, Pāli or Sanskrit (“le Bouddhisme vécu et prêché par le Buddha et
ses premiers disciples est donc bien, dans se grandes lignes tout au moins, celui que nous trouvons
décrit et enseigné dans les textes canoniques antiques qui nous sont parvenue en sanskrit, en pāli ou en
traduction chinoise”). Oldenberg 1898: 674-675 asks where to find the redactors and shrewd forgers
that would have been able to undertake such a task without betraying themselves a hundred or a thousand times (“aber wo gab es denn die raffinierten Fälscher, wo gab es die Redaktoren ... dass sie einer
solchen Arbeit gewachsen gewesen wären, ohne sich hundert- und tausendmal zu verraten!”). He maintains that what we find in the Buddhist texts has grown out of itself, out of its own roots, rather than
being a secondary redesign of a literature that originally could have been of a completely different appearance (“was wir hier vor uns haben, ist so, wie wir es sehen, aus sich selbst, aus seinen eigenen
Wurzeln erwachsen; es ist nicht eine sekundäre ... Umgestaltung einer Literatur, welche ursprünglich
ein ganz anderes Aussehen gezeigt haben könnte”).
147 Norman 1984/1992: 41 comments that “there is no consistent pattern of superiority in the Pāli version.
Sometimes the details of one version may be preferable, but never consistently so, and if we are trying
to establish the ‘original’ form of the text, it is necessary to take account of all versions known to us”.
He concludes (p. 44) that “all schools inherited an authoritative series of texts” and as “the other traditions have been shown, for the most part, to agree with the Pāli tradition ... by giving us an insight into
the form which the Buddhist texts had before the schisms, they have reinforced the authority of the Pāli
tradition and supported its claim to be authentic”.


Conclusion   •   891


At the same time, rather than giving us a completely new picture of early Buddhism,
what my comparative study of the parallels to the Majjhima-nikāya discourses yields is
a reconfirmation of the essentials, [148] with occasional divergence in details.


148 According to Lamotte 1958/1988: 639, “in order to appreciate early Buddhism, the only valid evidence

  - or indication – which we possess is the basic agreement between the Nikāyas on the one hand and the
Āgamas on the other. This evidence or indication carries more weight than academic hypotheses put
forward after an interval of twenty-five centuries” (Lamotte 1958: 708: “pour apprécier le bouddhisme
primitif, le seul témoignage  - ou indice  - valable dont nous disposions est l’accord foncier entre Nikāya
d’une part et Āgama de l’autre. Ce témoignage ou cet indice a plus de poids que des hypothèses savantes
échafaudées à vingt-cinq siècles de distance”).

3 The present list of works cited is arranged in alphabetical order without regard for diacritics, etc.; thus,
e.g., ä, ö, ü, ñ, and ś are sequenced as if they were a, o, u, n, and s. Surnames preceded by “de”, “von”,
etc., will be found under the surname itself, thus, e.g., Louis de La Vallée Poussin is listed as “La Vallée
Poussin, Louis de”, Oskar von Hinüber as “Hinüber, Oskar von”. For works with more than one author
or editor, only the first mentioned is given, followed by “et al.”. In the case of reprints or re-editions, the
date of the work actually used is usually preceded by the date of its first appearance, e.g., “Akanuma,

## Appendix: List of Parallels

The present appendix provides a survey of the main parallels to the discourses of the
Majjhima-nikāya on which I have based my comparative study in the preceding pages. [1]
With the term “parallel” I intend to indicate that two versions of a discourse are sufficiently similar to make it probable that they stem from the same occasion. When such
similarity only extends to parts of a discourse, I reckon the counterpart version to be a
“partial parallel”, marked in the table by the use of * in the third column and listed after
the full parallels in the same language. Needless to say, to employ such distinctions involves some degree of subjectivity, so that the indications given below are not meant as a
final statement on the issue, but merely as provisory hints. In fact, the relationship between the different versions of a discourse can involve a whole kaleidoscope of varying
shades of similarity or difference. To adequately reflect this through a set of fixed categories seems impossible, so that the use of the above set of classifications can only be an
approximation.
The table below gives the Majjhima-nikāya discourses and their locations in the first
and second columns. Parallels are listed in the alphabetical order of their languages, indicated in the third column, with the fourth column giving the respective discourse number,
etc., and the fifth column listing the locations of the parallels in alphabetical-numerical
order.


1 My survey of parallels to the Majjhima-nikāya, of which an earlier version appeared in Anālayo 2006d, is
based on Akanuma 1929/1990, the Fó-guāng ( ) indexes, Honjō 1984, Lamotte 1944/1981, id. 1949/
1981, id. 1970a, id. 1970/1976, id. 1980, Yìnshùn 1971/1983, references provided in the SHT series, and
indications made by Mark Allon, Rod Bucknell, Lance Cousins, Fumio Enomoto, Jens-Uwe Hartmann,
Noriyuki Kudo, Peter Skilling (who kindly allowed me to consult his notes on parallels to the MN), and
Ken Su, as well as my own readings of the primary sources (where especially the Ekottarika-āgama has
yielded several so far not recognized parallels). New parallels will continue to be found and a number of
relevant Sanskrit fragments are at present not yet edited, hence my listing of parallels is certainly not intended as the final word on extant parallels to the Majjhima-nikāya, but only as a survey of those parallels
of which I have been aware at the time of compiling my study. A more detailed explanation of my reasons
for not including some of the parallels that had been listed by Akanuma can be found in the respective comparative studies. The present survey does not comprehensively list all discourse quotations or secondary 佛光
material mentioned in the footnotes to the respective studies, but only the main parallel passages or texts
and, at times, closely related texts (as, e.g., other discourses on the ten powers and four intrepidities of a
Tathāgata in the case of [[MN12]]). An exception has been Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhā�ya (Abhidh-k-�), which due to its importance for my research I have included in the present table,
even in cases where the actual passage is only brief. As a result, the overall impression that the present table gives does not adequately reflect the quantitative importance of Chinese parallels, as some of the Sanskrit fragments and quotations from Abhidh-k-� listed under partial parallels (*) are rather short.

the bodhisattva can be found in the Chinese counterparts to the Lalitavistara and the Sa�ghabhedavastu, T
186 at T III 499b, T 187 at T III 560b, and T 191 at T III 944b, and also in such texts as T 184 at T III 467b,

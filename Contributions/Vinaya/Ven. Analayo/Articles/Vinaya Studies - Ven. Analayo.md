**Dharma Drum Institute of Liberal Arts (DILA) Series**


In 1994, Master Sheng Yen (1930–2009), the founder of
Dharma Drum Buddhist College, began publishing the series of
the Chung-Hwa Institute of Buddhist Studies. The purposes of
publishing this series were to provide a venue for academic research in Buddhist studies supported by scholarships from the
Chung-Hwa Institute of Buddhist Studies, to encourage topquality Buddhist research, and to cultivate an interest in Buddhist
research among the readership of the series. Moreover, by encouraging cooperation with international research institutions, Master
Sheng Yen hoped to foster the academic study of Buddhism in
Taiwan.

In keeping with this vision, in order to promote different
aspects of exchange in academic research, we at Dharma Drum
Buddhist College began to publish three educational series in
2007:

- Dharma Drum Buddhist College Research Series (DDBC-RS)

- Dharma Drum Buddhist College Translation Series (DDBC-TS)

- Dharma Drum Buddhist College Special Series (DDBC-SS)

In July 2014, the Taiwanese Ministry of Education deliberated
on the merging of the Dharma Drum College of Humanities and
Social Sciences and the Dharma Drum Buddhist College into the
newly formed Dharma Drum Institute of Liberal Arts (DILA).

The new DILA incarnations of the former three series are
now:

- Dharma Drum Institute of Liberal Arts Research Series (DILA
RS)

- Dharma Drum Institute of Liberal Arts Translation Series (DILA
TS)

- Dharma Drum Institute of Liberal Arts Special Series (DILA
SS)

Among our goals is the extensive development of digital publishing and information to adapt to the interactive and hyperconnective environment of the Web 2.0 age. This will allow research outcomes to be quickly shared and evaluated through the
participation of individual users, through such media as blogs,
shared tagging, wikis, social networks and so on. Our hope is to
work towards developing an open environment for academic
studies (perhaps called Science 2.0) on digital humanities that
will be more collaborative and efficient than traditional academic
studies. In this way, the Dharma Drum Institute of Liberal Arts
will continue to help foster the availability of digital resources for
Buddhist studies, the humanities, and the social sciences.

## **Foreword**

There are a few scholars, perhaps in any field, about whom
one jokes, "He writes more than I read!" Ven. Anālayo is certainly one of those about whom such comments are sometimes
made. The sheer volume of his scholarly output is astonishing, but
what is much more important, and impressive, is that the _quality_ of
this large body of work reaches the very same high level.

The previous volumes in this series of publications deal, serially, with the four collections of _Āgama_ s; in the present volume,
we are treated to a selection of studies focused on _Vinaya_ literature. Both are areas of inquiry to which Ven. Anālayo has contributed fundamentally. (And just to even it out, so to speak, he has
certainly not neglected the third of the three sections of the classical canon, the Abhidharma, the origins of which have recently
drawn his attention as well.)

It is no doubt far too early to start thinking about evaluating
Ven. Anālayo's contributions retrospectively. However, it is important and valuable to have his collected contributions on a selection of topics, of which the present volume forms one piece. It is
not the purpose of this appreciation to offer either a summary of
these contributions, or a critique of the points with which I might
not entirely agree. Rather, my purpose here is to reflect for a few
moments on the accomplishments of the author, and the significance of his contributions to the field of Buddhist Studies.

Although there have been, naturally, a number of notable exceptions in the roughly 150-year history of modern Buddhist
Studies (one may think in the first place of F. Weller or E. Waldschmidt, for instance), it remains the fact that most (non-East
Asian) scholars working on South Asian Buddhism, and particu

xii  _Vinaya_ Studies


larly those focused on so-called Early Buddhism, make scant use
of the treasures preserved in Chinese translations. It is often repeated that the – again we are forced to say "so-called" – Theravāda traditions have preserved the only intact and complete canon
in an Indian language, namely in Pāli. While this may be true (in
fact, the notion of completeness is much less lucid than it might
seem), it is hardly a compelling reason to ignore the invaluable
materials preserved in the first place in Chinese.

Ven. Anālayo, German by birth, trained and ordained as a monk
in the Sri Lankan tradition, also began his studies with a solidly
Pāli-centric orientation, but he came, over the course of several
years, to realize the central importance of Chinese. A long series
of publications has introduced, with exquisite philological rigour,
the riches preserved in the first place in Chinese translations of
Indian _Āgama_ texts. In the present volume the emphasis is on the
_Vinaya_ . Or rather, we must very carefully and precisely use the
plural: the _Vinaya_ s, for we have naturally not merely the single
_Vinaya_ tradition in Pāli, but a number in Chinese, in addition to the
Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ preserved also in Sanskrit and Tibetan,
and consequently paid much more attention by a greater number
of (non-East Asian) scholars than those collections preserved only
(or almost only) in Chinese.

The _Vinaya_ literature is a vast ocean, the expanses of which
have been, so far, rather little explored by modern scholars. Ven.
Anālayo does not attempt any general synthesis or overall introduction. [1] What he does instead is, without fuss or unduly drawing
attention to the fact, study particular problems on the basis of _all_
the relevant evidence. What has first drawn the author's attention
to any individual problem is not always easy to discern, but a few
patterns are clear, including an ongoing interest in the status of

nuns within the Buddhist monastic communities. In several contributions published here, he explores issues related to the order
of nuns, the foundation of the order, and proper ordination. This,
of course, has a vital present-day aspect, since there continue to
be discussions, sometimes quite passionate, about the legality of
female monastic ordination in the cases where traditional ordination lineages have died out.

While the real-world implications of questions around the
ordination of women are clear and do not require to be emphasized, one of the most characteristic aspects of Ven. Anālayo's
studies is that seemingly no subject he picks up is treated as if it
were a mere historical artefact, dead to today's world. Quite the
opposite: he seems always to see the texts as alive and vital, as
relevant, either actually or potentially, in the present. All scholarship, when reliable, can be seen as providing bricks, smaller or
larger, out of which the larger edifice of knowledge about the past
is being built. It may be that in some cases, or in many cases, the
scholar who produces the brick in question is actually not quite
sure – or may not have even considered the question of – where
that brick should fit.

I have the impression that Ven. Anālayo always has a large architectural drawing in his mind, that he always has a clear idea of
where he thinks his bricks might fit. For this reason, perhaps, a
large amount of his scholarly output is fundamental: he offered
several years ago, for instance, two gigantic volumes in which he
systematically compared the Pāli _Majjhima-nikāya_ with its parallels in Chinese, Sanskrit, and Tibetan. His approach to specific issues is the same: he attempts to exhaust the textual (and archaeological, and art-historical) sources, drawing upon all relevant materials. This, not incidentally, has recently been visible also in his
concerted efforts to emphasize that exclusive focus on the _Āgama_ /
_Nikāya_ corpus on the one hand or the _Vinaya_ corpus on the other

can lead to unsatisfactory evaluations of both; only by looking
holistically at all sources are we able to make positive steps forward.

The present volume collecting a few contributions on issues
related to _Vinaya_ studies, if it (re)introduces the author's efforts to
examine this literature scientifically - dispassionately, but with
passion, if one may say that – will doubtlessly contribute to an increased appreciation for, and promote engagement with, the literary sources of the Buddhist past, and increase our appreciation for
their continued vitality into the present. I am delighted, therefore,
to welcome its publication.

## **Introduction**

The present volume contains revised papers on topics related to
_Vinaya_, thereby forming a companion volume to my collected papers
with _Dīrgha-āgama_ studies (2017b), _Madhyama-āgama_ studies
(2012e), _Saṃyukta-āgama_ studies (2015e), and _Ekottarika-āgama_
studies (2016a).


**Contents**

I begin in the first chapter by exploring the legal significance
of a breach of a _pārājika_ rule, arguing that this indeed entails a
loss of communion with the Community of the four directions
and needs to be differentiated from the question of residential
rights in a particular monastery. I also examine the implications
of the absence of the _śikṣādattaka_ observance, recorded in several
other _Vinaya_ s, from the Theravāda _Vinaya_ .

The next three chapters are dedicated to the significance of
_Vinaya_ narrative. My main point here is to draw attention to the
distinct nature of this type of text and its functioning as part of the
overall educational project of _Vinaya_ teachings, which inevitably
circumscribes the use to which such literature can be put by the
modern scholar. My concern is in particular to draw attention to
the need to avoid the naïve assumption that _Vinaya_ stories are necessarily accurate records of what actually happened on the ground
in Indian Buddhist monasticism.

The second and third chapters are based on narratives that come
with the first and third _pārājika_ . These are the tales of Sudinna,
who engaged in sexual intercourse with his former wife to ensure
the continuity of his family lineage, and the story of how a recommendation by the Buddha of contemplation of the body [[BU-AS2]]  _Vinaya_ Studies


bereft of beauty led a substantial number of monks to engage in
this practice with such lack of balance that they eventually committed suicide. In the course of attempting to understand the
genesis of the dramatic tale of the mass suicide of monks I also
explore the overlap that exists between discourse and _Vinaya_
literature, which implies that _Vinaya_ texts are best read in conjunction with the discourses, rather than on their own.

My suggestion that _Vinaya_ narrative is hardly a historical record becomes particularly evident with the fourth chapter, in which
I take up occurrences of a _jātaka_ tale found in the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_, a tale known in the Pāli tradition as the _Vessantara-_
_jātaka_ . In addition to exploring its function as a _Vinaya_ narrative,
my interest in this chapter is also to understand the roots of the
basic trope of Vessantara's gifts in brahminical conceptions and
how this trope came to be accommodated to its present Buddhist
setting.

With the fifth chapter I turn to the account of the foundation of
the order of nuns, based on a version of this episode extant as an
individual translation into Chinese. Elsewhere I have studied the
different versions of this event in detail, [1] wherefore in the present
chapter I instead examine the convergence of soteriological inclusiveness, institutional androcentrism, and ascetic misogyny in this
text and in comparison with attitudes towards women in modern
Thailand.

In the following chapter I critically survey four theories proposed by other scholars concerning the foundation history of the
order of nuns, concluding that each of these fails to provide a convincing explanation of this particular _Vinaya_ narrative due to a failure to take into account all of the relevant textual material, be this
out of oversight or due to flawed methodological premises.

Introduction  3


The narrative of the first _saṅgīti_ is the topic of the seventh
chapter, in particular the decision of the assembled monks not to
follow the Buddha's permission to abolish the minor rules, a decision which sets the stage for an attitude towards _Vinaya_ rules as
the unchangeable essence of the monastic life.

The same attitude also has considerable impact on the controversy surrounding the revival of _bhikkhunī_ ordination, which I
study in detail in the eighth and longest chapter in this book.
Whereas the previous chapters are based on revised versions of a
single article, in this chapter I combine extracts from several
studies I published on this topic, in an attempt to clarify a rather
complex situation. My study covers elements influencing traditional Theravāda monastic attitudes, the legal dimensions of the
situation that do enable such a revival, and problems with seeing
the revival of _bhikkhunī_ ordination as a move for gender equality.

The final part of the book consists of three appendices. The
first of these is just an annotation to my translation of a passage
from the _Cullavagga_ in chapter 8, in which I left the term _paṇḍaka_
untranslated, wherefore in the appendix I survey contributions
made by other scholars on the significance of the term. Related to
the same chapter is also second appendix, in which I take up the
quest for _Vinaya_ texts by the pilgrim Fǎxiǎn (法顯). This forms
part of the background to the transmission of the _bhikkhunī_ ordination lineage from Sri Lanka to China. The appendix surveys
Fǎxiǎn's search for _Vinaya_ texts to be brought back to China for
translation. In the last appendix I then study the significance of
the term _āsava_, whose removal forms the rationale underpinning
the promulgation of _Vinaya_ rules.


**Conventions**

Since a considerable part of my target audience will be familiar
mainly with the Pāli canon, in what follows I employ Pāli terminol

4  _Vinaya_ Studies


ogy, except for anglicized terms like "bodhisattva", "Dharma", or
"Nirvāṇa", without thereby intending to take a position on the
original language of the texts in question or to suggest that Pāli
language is in principle preferable. I hope this will facilitate access
to my studies by those who are more familiar with Pāli terms.

In the notes to those parts of the studies that contain translations from the Chinese, I discuss only selected differences in
relation to the Pāli and other parallels. Abbreviations in such
translations are usually found as such in the Chinese original.
These are reproduced with an ellipsis. Instructions in the original
that indicate the need to recite the elided text are given in italics.

In the translations, I use square brackets [ ] to indicate supplementation and angle brackets   to mark emendation. In order to
facilitate cross-referencing, I use square brackets in subscript to
provide the pagination of the original Chinese text on which the
translation is based and the pagination of the original paper, as well
as superscript for its footnote or endnote numbering, whenever these
differ from the present annotation. [2] In chapter 8 I have dispensed
with this practice, since this chapter combines revised and rearranged extracts from five different articles, making it no longer
feasible to refer to the original pagination and annotation. When
quoting text editions, I have occasionally standardized or adjusted
the punctuation.


**Translation Terminology**

When translating, I have attempted to stay close to the terminology adopted by Bhikkhu Bodhi in his renderings of the Pāli
equivalents, to facilitate comparison. In the case of 苦, equivalent
to _dukkha_, however, I simply keep the Pāli term, which at times

pagination or footnote numbering are not in sequential order.


Introduction  5


does stand for outright "pain", but on many an occasion refers to
"unsatisfactoriness", where translations like "suffering" or "pain"
fail to convey adequately the sense of the passage in question.
The standard rendering of _bhagavant_ in Chinese is 世尊, literally
"World Honoured One", in which case I follow Bhikkhu Bodhi's
translation of the corresponding Pāli term and adopt the rendering
"Blessed One". For 慈 I use the Pāli equivalent _mettā_, and for 漏,
corresponding to _āsava_, I employ the rendering "influx". [3]

## **_Pārājika_**

**Introduction**

In this chapter I explore the legal consequences a fully ordained monk (and by implication a fully ordained nun) incurs on
violating a _pārājika_ rule. I begin with the relevant indications
given in the code of rules ( _prātimokṣa_ / _pātimokkha_ ) itself, before
turning to the story of a monk who had apparently violated such a
rule and still tried to participate in the _uposatha_ observance, the
fortnightly recital of the code of rules.

Next I take up the difference between being no longer considered part of the community of fully ordained monks and the residential right to live in a particular monastery, since I believe that
keeping in mind this distinction can avoid possible confusions
about the significance of being "in communion", _saṃvāsa_ . [1] Based
on this distinction, I then examine which of these two meanings
corresponds to the legal consequences of a breach of a _pārājika_
regulation and evaluate the _śikṣādattaka_ observance mentioned in
a range of _Vinaya_ s, together with the conclusions that can be drawn
from its absence in the Theravāda _Vinaya_ .


**Reciting the Code of Rules**

In what follows I take as my example the case of a fully ordained monk who voluntarily engages in sexual intercourse without having beforehand given up his ordained status. According to
a stipulation that forms part of the formulation of the first _pārājika_
in the code of rules of the different Buddhist monastic traditions,

8  _Vinaya_ Studies


acting in this way turns a monk into one who is "not in communion", _asaṃvāsa_ . [2]

The idea of a monk who is not in communion can be illustrated with an episode that depicts an immoral monk seated in a
gathering of monks assembled for the recital of the code of rules. [3]
Below I translate one of two similar _Madhyama-āgama_ accounts
of this episode.

Versions of this event can be found in several discourses from
different transmission lineages, among them also two discourses
in the _Aṅguttara-nikāya_ and the _Udāna_ respectively, and as well
in various _Vinaya_ s, including the Theravāda _Vinaya_ . This situation exemplifies a general overlap between discourse and _Vinaya_
texts in the Theravāda tradition and elsewhere, which makes it
advisable not to consider _Vinaya_ literature on its own as the only
source for supposed in-house information on what took place on
the ground in the Indian Buddhist monastic traditions. [4] Instead,
both types of text are best read in conjunction.

In the present case, the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ in fact does
not report the episode and instead refers to the _Poṣadha-sūtra_ of
the (Mūlasarvāstivāda) _Madhyama-āgama_ for the full story. [5]

Again, whereas Buddhaghosa's _Manorathapūraṇī_ and Dhammapāla's _Paramatthadīpanī_ offer detailed information on this episode, this is not the case for the _Vinaya_ commentary _Samanta_ _pāsādikā_ . [6] This implies that the reciters both of the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ and of the Pāli commentaries expected their audience or readership to use _Vinaya_ material alongside discourse
material, rather than in isolation. [3]


**Translation (1)**


At that time, it being the fifteenth of the month and the
time to recite the code of rules, the Blessed One sat in front of
the community of monks on a prepared seat. Having sat down,
the Blessed One in turn entered concentration and with the
knowledge of the mind of others he surveyed the minds in the
community. Having surveyed the minds in the community, he
sat silently until the end of the first watch of the night.

Then one monk got up from his seat, arranged his robes
over one shoulder and said, with his hands held together towards the Buddha: "Blessed One, the first watch of the night

300f seems to have misunderstood this reference in the Sanskrit version, leading him to conflate it with the ensuing text that concerns another episode and
then to conclude that the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ account differs substantially
from the other versions. J.-H. Shih 2000: 142 note 40 repeats these mistaken
conclusions, even though p. 146 note 49 she shows awareness of the fact that
the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ does not report the episode.

von Hinüber 2015a: 425 explains that, "though attributed to Buddhaghosa,
his authorship can be safely ruled out. The form and content of the introductory verses are quite different from the beginning of both the _Sumaṅgala_ _vilāsinī_ and the _Atthasālinī_, and so is the method followed in this commentary"; cf. also Kieffer-Pülz 2015: 431.

has already come to an end. The Buddha and the community
of monks have been sitting together for a long time. May the
Blessed One recite the code of rules."

Then the Blessed One remained silent and did not reply.
Thereupon the Blessed One kept sitting silently further through
the middle watch of the night.

Then that one monk got up again from his seat, arranged
his robes over one shoulder and said, with his hands held together towards the Buddha: "Blessed One, the first watch of
the night has passed and the middle watch of the night is about
to end. The Buddha and the community of monks have been
sitting together for a long time. May the Blessed One recite the
code of rules."

The Blessed One again remained silent and did not reply.
Thereupon the Blessed One kept sitting silently further through
the last watch of the night.

Then that one monk got up from his seat for a third time,
arranged his robes over one shoulder and said, with his hands
held together towards the Buddha: "Blessed One, the first
watch of the night has passed, the middle watch of the night
has also come to an end, and the last watch of the night is
about to end. It is near dawn and soon the dawn will arise. The
Buddha and the community of monks have been sitting together for a very long time. May the Blessed One recite the
code of rules."

Then the Blessed One said to that monk: "One monk in this
community has become impure."

At that time the venerable Mahāmoggallāna was also among
the community. Thereupon the venerable Mahāmoggallāna
thought in turn: [4] 'Of which monk does the Blessed One say
that one monk in this community has become impure? Let me
enter an appropriate type of concentration so that, by way of


_Pārājika_  11


that appropriate type of concentration, by knowing the minds
of others, I will survey the minds in the community.'

The venerable Mahāmoggallāna entered an appropriate
type of concentration so that, by way of that appropriate type
of concentration, by knowing the minds of others, he surveyed
the minds in the community. The venerable Mahāmoggallāna
in turn knew of which monk the Blessed One had said that one
monk in this community had become impure.

Thereupon the venerable Mahāmoggallāna rose from concentration and went in front of that monk, took him by the arm
and led him out, opening the door and placing him outside [with
the words]: "Foolish man, go far away, do not stay in here. You
are no longer in communion with the community of monks,
since you have now already left it, no [longer] being a monk."
He closed the door and locked it.


**Study (1)**

After Mahāmoggallāna has taken the culprit out, the Buddha
explains that he will no longer recite the code of rules for the
monks and, in the version translated above, describes how someone might falsely pretend to be a true monk until his companions
recognize him for who he truly is. [7] In most of the versions that I
will be considering below, the Buddha instead delivers a comparison of qualities of the monastic community with those of the ocean.

minds of the monks in the community, information that is found,
however, in the Pāli commentaries. [9] This concords with a general
pattern of a commentarial type of information making its way into

texts reach a point of closure. [10]

The two Pāli discourse versions that report this episode, together with several parallels preserved as individual translations,
a discourse quotation in the _Abhidharmakośopāyikā-ṭīkā_, as well
as the Mahīśāsaka, Mahāsāṅghika, Dharmaguptaka, and Theravāda _Vinaya_ s, identify the monk who requested the Buddha three
times to recite the code of rules as having been Ānanda. [11]

According to the _Aṅguttara-nikāya_ version (together with the
_Udāna_ discourse and the Theravāda _Vinaya_ ), an _Ekottarika-āgama_
parallel, and a version preserved as an individual translation, Mahāmoggallāna had first told the monk to leave, and only when the
culprit did not take any action did Mahāmoggallāna put him outside forcefully. [12] [5]

In a version preserved as an individual translation the Buddha
himself encourages Mahāmoggallāna to survey the assembly in

order to identify the culprit, [13] and in another individually preserved discourse the Buddha even asks Mahāmoggallāna to take
the immoral monk out. [14]

Alongside such variations, however, the parallel versions
agree on the basic denouement of events. In spite of repeated
requests, the Buddha does not recite the code of rules because an
immoral monk is present in the community. Mahāmoggallāna
spots the culprit and puts him outside of the building in which the
_uposatha_ ceremony was to be held. The fact that in all versions
the immoral monk is removed from the location where the code
of rules is to be recited makes it clear that he must have committed a breach of a _pārājika_ rule. In fact the Pāli versions, for example, qualify him as one who pretended to be celibate but did not
practise celibacy. [15]

The account of this episode in the _Aṅguttara-nikāya_ version
has been taken by Juo-Hsüeh Shih (2000b: 144 and 148) to convey the sense that the guilty monk "remained in the community",
a supposed inconsistency that then leads her to the assumption
that perhaps


at the very outset of Buddhist monasticism, even the gravest offence may not have incurred expulsion from the _Saṅgha_
in the sense of permanent excommunication involving loss of
monastic status.


The passage from the _Aṅguttara-nikāya_ version on which she
bases this conclusion describes that the ocean washes any corpse

ashore, comparable to how the monastic community does not associate with an immoral person. [16] The relevant passage states that


even though he is seated in the midst of the community of
monks, yet he is far from the community and the community is
far from him.


The idea that this implies some sort of leniency for even the
gravest offence appears to be based on a misunderstanding of this
passage. It simply reflects the situation that prevailed throughout
the night before Mahāmoggallāna took action. In fact the previous
part of the discourse employs the same expression "seated in the
midst of the community of monks" to refer to the immoral monk
spotted by Mahāmoggallāna. [17]

Even though this immoral monk was seated among the community of monks, due to his moral failure he was already not in
communion and for this reason was far from the monastic community already at that time.

Instead of implying some sort of leniency, the passage rather
helps to clarify that not being in communion does not depend on
an action taken by others to expulse an immoral monk, but is
something that happens as soon as the _pārājika_ rule is broken.
From that moment onwards, the monk is _de facto_ no longer a
fully ordained monk and _de facto_ no longer in communion, even
if he pretends otherwise and goes so far as to seat himself among
a congregation of monks at the time of the recital of the code of
rules. [18] [6]

This is in fact self-evident from the formulation in the different versions of the _pārājika_ rule quoted at the outset of this chapter. The condition of _asaṃvāsa_ is incurred right at the time of the
moral breach. The principle behind this is that communion obtains only for the morally pure with others who are also pure. [19]

An additional argument by J.-H. Shih (2000: 141) involves
another discourse in the _Aṅguttara-nikāya_, which according to her
assessment implies that "one can make good by atonement even
for an offence of Defeat."

The passage in question states that "one who has committed a
_pārājika_ offence will ' _paṭikaroti_ ' according to the Dharma." [20] The
key for understanding this passage is the term _paṭikaroti_, which I
have on purpose not translated in order to leave room for first ascertaining its meaning. Another occurrence of the term _paṭikaroti_,
together with the same qualification of being done "according to
the Dharma", can be found in the _Sāmaññaphala-sutta_, after King
Ajātasattu had just confessed that he had killed his father. The Buddha replies that in this way the king has performed an action described as _paṭikaroti_ "according to the Dharma". [21]

Although this verb on its own can at times convey meanings
like "make amendment for", "redress", or "atone", since the king
was not a monastic (in fact previous to this visit not even a lay
follower of the Buddha), in the present context the whole phrase
cannot stand for making amendments for a breach of a monastic

rule. Nor does it seem to imply a successful atoning for the evil
done, since as soon as the king has left the Buddha tells the assembled monks that, due to being a patricide, Ajātasattu had become unable to realize even the first of the four levels of awakening. [22] Instead, in the _Sāmaññaphala-sutta_ the phrase _paṭikaroti_
"according to the Dharma" has the simple sense of a confession. [23]

The same sense is also appropriate for the _Aṅguttara-nikāya_
passage, which on this understanding describes that "one who has
committed a _pārājika_ offence will confess it according to the
Dharma." This fits the context well, since the immediately preceding part speaks of not even committing a _pārājika_ offence.
Thus the remainder of the passage conveys the sense that, if such
persons should nevertheless commit a _pārājika_, at least they will
confess the moral breach according to the Dharma.

Besides, the same _Aṅguttara-nikāya_ discourse uses the identical
expression also in relation to one who has committed a _pācittiya_ or
else a _pāṭidesanīya_ offence. Since committing a simple _pācittiya_
offence only requires confession, as is the case for a _pāṭidesanīya_
offence, the phrase _paṭikaroti_ "according to the Dharma" here must
mean precisely that, namely that the breach is being confessed.

Such confession then marks the difference compared to the
monk in the _Madhyama-āgama_ passage translated above, who did
not confess and instead pretended to be still in communion by join

19. In his detailed study of the present episode in relation to the significance
of confession, Derrett 1997: 59 explains that those in front of whom such _paṭi_  _karoti_ according to the Dharma takes place "do not forgive or pardon him, nor
is the offence atoned for, or washed away. No 'amends' are made … [even]
condonation is not in point here … [but] an acceptance occurs like a creditor's

ing the community for the recital of the code of rules. In such a
case an "expulsion" is required, as quite vividly exemplified by the
course of action undertaken by Mahāmoggallāna. The same is not
the case for one who confesses "according to the Dharma" a breach
of a _pārājika_ rule. In other words, such a breach invariably entails
loss of communion, but does not necessarily require expulsion. [24]
As explained by Hüsken (1997a: 93), [7]


if an offender is aware of his _pārājika_ offence and leaves
the order on his own initiative, the _Vinaya_ describes no concrete act of expulsion.


The commentary on the _Aṅguttara-nikāya_ discourse explains
that a monk who confesses according to the Dharma in this way
will be able to continue the monastic life by establishing himself
in the condition of being a novice. [25] The commentary does not
mention other alternatives, giving the impression that this was
considered the appropriate course of action in such a situation.

In sum, the suggestions by J.-H. Shih are not convincing. Contrary to her presentation, a monk who has committed a breach of a
_pārājika_ rule is indeed "not in communion", as indicated explicitly in the various codes of rules, and such loss of communion has
been incurred at the very moment of the breach of morality. Even
if such a monk should be seated among the community, as in the
passage translated above, in actual fact he is far away from it in
the sense of no longer being in communion with them. The ques

tion of expulsion is relevant to such a case, not to one who honestly
confesses and in this way acts "according to the Dharma".

The idea that a breach of a _pārājika_ rule somehow should have
only limited consequences has also inspired Kovan (2013: 794),
who proposes that "the _pārājika_ rules (initiated in and) structured
around a communal body are attenuated in solitude." Kovan (2013:
794 note 27) bases this suggestion on contrasting individual suicides of monks like Channa to a mass suicide of monks disgusted
with their own bodies. [26] In the case of the mass suicide, according
to his assessment


in that communal monastic context the Buddha's condemnation of suicide is unequivocal and suggests nothing of the
'particularism' of the responses he appears to bring to the
solitary monks in the other cases.


Now the _pārājika_ rule common to the different _Vinaya_ s concerns killing someone else as well as inciting someone else to commit suicide or actively assisting in it, and this sets the context for
the story of the mass suicide of monks and their receiving assistance in killing themselves. In contrast, Channa as an example of
"the solitary monks in the other cases" only killed himself. Thus
cases like Channa cannot reflect a restricted scope of _pārājika_
rules, simply because what he did was not a breach of a _pārājika_
offence in the first place. Kovan's idea turns out to be as groundless as the suggestions by J.-H. Shih.


**The Community of the Four Directions**

The idea that somehow the _pārājika_ rules must have a more
limited scope than usually believed leads me on to a suggestion

made by Clarke (2009c), according to which committing a _pārā_ _jika_ offence might only result in a loss of communion with a specific local community. [27]

His main case study is a tale from the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_
about a matricide whose status as a fully ordained monk is revoked by the Buddha when this becomes known. The matricide
decides not to return to lay life, but goes instead to a remote place,

[8] [ where a lay supporter builds a dwelling for him that is subse-]
quently also used by other monks. [28]

Clarke (2009c: 135) interprets this story as implying that the
matricide monk was only


no longer a member of the Buddha's local monastic community. His membership in the Community of the Four Quarters, however, seems not to have been revoked. Accordingly,
he was able to go down the road and join (or even start) another (local) monastic community, a place in which he would
be 'in communion'.


When evaluating such stories, it needs to be kept in mind, as
pointed out by Silk (2007: 277) in his study of this tale, that


caution would suggest that such stories be read and interpreted in terms other than as reports of actual incidents which
historically led to the promulgation of particular rules of the
Buddhist monastic codes.


This pertinent observation reflects a basic requirement when
studying _Vinaya_ narrative, namely a clear recognition of the type
of information that such literature can and cannot yield. As I will

20  _Vinaya_ Studies


argued in the next two chapters, _Vinaya_ narrative is not comparable to a record of case-law precedents in modern judicial proceedings, but much rather serves teaching purposes in the context of
legal education in a monastic setting. [29] Keeping this function in
mind helps appreciate why in _Vinaya_ literature legal discussions
and _jātaka_ tales go hand in hand. [30]

This in turn implies, however, that caution is indeed required
before taking such tales as reliable records of what actually happened on the ground and then drawing far-reaching conclusions,
based on them, regarding the significance of being in communion.

Moreover, it seems preferable not to base any conclusions on
what is found in a single _Vinaya_ only. As succinctly formulated in
a different context by Kieffer-Pülz (2014: 62), "general statements
on the basis of only one Vinaya should belong to the past" of the
academic field of Buddhist Studies.

Besides the need for caution when drawing conclusions based
on a single _Vinaya_ narrative, even taking the tale of the matricide
at face value does not give the impression that it was acceptable
for a monk who had lost communion to settle this by just proceeding to another local community. The point rather seems to be
that the matricide on his own and without any explicitly mentioned precedent or permission decided to go to a distant place,
quite probably just because nobody there would know him as a
matricide. That a lay supporter builds a _vihāra_ for him has no implications regarding the matricide's status as a fully ordained
monk, nor does it imply that he is truly in communion with other
fully ordained monks.

The same holds for the circumstance that other monks come to
dwell in that _vihāra_ . All this could equally well have happened if

he simply pretended to be a regular monk in front of his supporter
and the visiting monks, similar to the monk in the passage from
the _Madhyama-āgama_ translated above, [9] who pretended to be
still in communion. [31]

If loss of communion had indeed applied only to a local community, one would expect stories reflecting this understanding to
be reported in the different _Vinaya_ s. Take for example a monk
obsessed with seducing women, who could continue having sex
with any women he is able to approach as a monk by simply
moving from one local community to the next, as soon as he is
discovered. Records of such monks, together with the vexation
their behaviour caused to well-behaved monks and the outraged
reaction of the husbands in particular and the laity in general
would surely have stood good chances of inspiring the narrative
imagination of the reciters of the different _Vinaya_ s.

Moreover, given the peregrination of monks from one monastery to another, the idea of communion with a local community
would not be particularly practicable. In concrete terms it would
mean that the culprit would be barred from staying at the monastery in which he was dwelling when committing his breach of
conduct. A ruling which envisages only loss of residential rights
in the local monastery for one who has committed a _pārājika_


――――――
31 In fact Silk 2007: 281 reports that the story continues with one of the disci
ples, after the death of this monk, trying to ascertain through supernormal
powers where his teacher "has been reborn. Using his supernatural sight he is
able to survey the realms of transmigration ( _saṃsāra_ ), beginning with that of
the gods and, when he does not locate him there, descending through the realms
of humans, animals and hungry ghosts. It is only when he examines the lowest
realm, that of hell, that he discovers his teacher in the great Avīci hell, and
upon seeking the cause of his fate learns of his master's earlier crime of matricide." This denouement of the narrative makes it fair to assume that the monk
hid his matricide and pretended to be a fully ordained monk.


22  _Vinaya_ Studies


offence would have failed to fulfil its purposes, which the _Vinaya_ s
indicate to be restraining badly behaved monks and protecting
well-behaved monks, inspiring non-Buddhists and increasing the
faith of Buddhists. [32]

In sum, the consequences that Clarke's suggestion entails on a
practical level make it safe to conclude that the idea that a _pārā_ _jika_ offence only entails loss of communion with a local community is unconvincing.

Besides, the present tale is not even a case of having committed a _pārājika_ offence, as noted by Clarke (2009c: 126) himself.
The killing of the mother took place when the protagonist of the
tale was still a lay person. Therefore he had not committed an infraction of any _pārājika_ rule, which only applies to fully ordained
monastics. The present case thereby seems similar in this respect
to the suggestion by Kovan, which was also based on drawing conclusions about the scope of _pārājika_ based on stories that do not involve a breach of a _pārājika_ rule.

In the present case, as a matricide the monk was held unfit for
higher ordination, presumably due to not standing a chance of
realizing awakening (comparable to Ajātasattu as a patricide).
This leaves hardly any room for considering this story as hinting
at loss of communion being only relevant to a local community.

Instead of the approach taken by Clarke, it seems to me that a
proper appreciation of the significance of loss of communion for
a monk who has committed a _pārājika_ offence lies in the opposite
direction, namely by setting aside as irrelevant to this topic the
issue of being allowed to live in a particular monastery. This has

no direct bearing on the question of being considered a full member of the community of the four directions, since these two are
distinct matters. As explained by Nolot (1999: 59f note 9), [10]


absolute _a-saṃvāsa_ is incurred by monks and nuns who
have committed a Pār[ājika] offence and are, as a consequence,
deprived of their very status: they are said not to belong to the
(universal) Saṃgha anymore.


When Clarke (2009c: 132) reasons: "whether or not one can be
expelled from the Community of the Four Quarters is not clear, at
least to me", then perhaps a simile from the modern living situation of an academic might help to clarify the situation. Suppose
someone passes his PhD exam and starts teaching as an assistant
professor, but then is found out to have plagiarized his thesis,
whereupon he loses degree and position. Expressed in _Vinaya_
terminology, he is not in communion with the community of PhD
holders of the four directions. He no longer has the right to apply
for a teaching or research position at a university anywhere in the
world, claiming to hold a PhD degree, not only at the university
where he originally received his degree.

Nevertheless, this does not mean he is forbidden to enter the
university grounds. Even at his own university he could still use
the library or listen to lectures; if the university has a hostel he
might stay overnight or even live there for an extended period of
time. But he will not be recognized as holding a PhD degree.

Conversely, someone else can be barred from entering the university grounds for a variety of reasons that need not be related at
all to undertaking PhD research or to the degree to be obtained on
properly carrying out such research.

The rather distinct situation of residential rights in a local monastery can be further illustrated with an excerpt from another discourse in the _Madhyama-āgama_, which I translate below as a com

plement to the passage rendered in the first part of this chapter. [33]
Whereas the first discourse showcases loss of communion with
the universal community of the four directions, the present passage rather concerns loss of residential rights in a local community.


**Translation (2)**


At that time the venerable Dhammika was an elder in his
native region, being in charge of the _stūpa_ and in a position of
seniority towards others. He was fierce, impatient, and very
coarse, cursing and condemning other monks. Because of this,
all the monks of his native region left and went away; they did
not enjoy staying there.

Thereupon the male lay disciples of his native region, seeing that all the monks of his native region left and went away,
that they did not enjoy staying there, thought in turn: 'What is
the reason that all the monks of this native region leave and go
away, that they do not enjoy staying here?'

The male lay disciples of his native region heard that the
venerable Dhammika, who was an elder in this native region,
being in charge of the _stūpa_ and in a position of seniority towards others, was fierce, impatient, and very coarse, cursing
and condemning other monks. [11] Because of this the monks
of his native region all left and went away; they did not enjoy
staying there. Having heard it, the male lay disciples of his
native region together approached the venerable Dhammika
and expelled him. They evicted Dhammika from all monasteries in his native region and made him depart.

Then the venerable Dhammika, having been expelled by
the male lay disciples of his native region, having been evicted

_Pārājika_  25


from all monasteries in his native region and made to depart,
took his robes and bowl and went travelling.


**Study (2)**

A parallel to this discourse preserved in the _Aṅguttara-nikāya_
differs in so far as Dhammika is first told by the lay disciples to
go to another monastery still within his native district. [34] Once he
is there, he behaves as earlier, so that the same happens again and
again, and this eventually results in him being expelled from all
monasteries in his native region. Another difference is that the
_Aṅguttara-nikāya_ version does not refer to _stūpa_ s, a topic to which
I will return at the end of this chapter.

Although Dhammika had been expelled from all monasteries
of his native region, he remained a fully ordained monk. Expressed
in _Vinaya_ legal terminology, he remained "in communion". In
whatever monastery outside of his native region he went to stay
next, he had the right to act as a fully ordained monk and would
have been not only allowed, but even expected to participate in
the recitation of the code of rules. Although what he had done led
to his expulsion from the monasteries of his native region, his
behaviour as such did not involve a breach of any _pārājika_ rule.

Another noteworthy feature of this case is that those who expelled the monk Dhammika were laymen. In other words, not
only are residential rights in a local monastery quite different
from loss of communion, but decisions regarding such residential
rights need not even be taken by monks, as according to the present episode the laity can do so as well.

In fact, dwelling in a monastery is not an exclusive privilege
of fully ordained monks (or fully ordained nuns in the case of a
nunnery). Monasteries can also serve as a residence for novices,


――――――

for example, and at times lay people also live in a monastery. Due
to the restrictions placed on fully ordained monastics by their
rules, they require the assistance of the laity for certain tasks that
they cannot perform themselves, which makes it convenient if
such a lay helper also stays in the same monastery. [35]

Thus a fully ordained monk who has lost his status of being in
communion can still continue to live at the very same monastery in
which he was staying when his breach of morality happened. His
being no longer in communion only refers to his inability to function any longer as a fully fledged member of the monastic community in legal matters, such as participating in the recital of the code
of rules, to stay with the earlier example. Having lost the right to
consider himself a fully ordained monk, he can either live at the
monastery as a lay disciple or else, [12] as mentioned in the commentary on the _Aṅguttara-nikāya_ passage related to the phrase _paṭikaroti_
"according to the Dharma", he can do so having become a novice.

Clarifying the basic distinction between residential permit in a
particular monastery and legal permit to perform legal actions as a
fully ordained monk also helps to put into perspective the _śikṣā_ _dattaka_ observance, a provision found in the Dharmaguptaka,
Mahāsāṅghika, Mahīśāsaka, Mūlasarvāstivāda, and Sarvāstivāda
_Vinaya_ s applicable to the case under discussion in this chapter,
namely a monk who has committed a breach of the _pārājika_ rule
on celibacy. [36]

Clarke (2009b: 27), to whom we are indebted for a detailed
study of this topic, reports that the " _śikṣādattaka_ is effectively
reduced to a position of subservience and humility". In several

else] not permitted to discuss the _Vinaya_, recite or listen to
recitations of the _Prātimokṣa_ .


If this is the case, then it is not clear why Clarke (2009b: 8)
concludes that the _śikṣādattaka_ "is most certainly not expelled (or
'no longer in communion' [ _asaṃvāsa_ ])". As I hope my earlier
discussion would have clarified, being expelled needs to be differentiated from being no longer in communion. The former only
applies to certain cases, the latter to all instances of a breach of a
_pārājika_ rule. Regarding the latter, restrictions of the type mentioned in the quote above do imply that the _śikṣādattaka_ is no
longer in communion, _asaṃvāsa_ . [37]

Since the status of being _śikṣādattaka_ does imply a loss of
communion and a demotion in status, this in turn means that, if a
fully ordained monk voluntarily engages in sexual intercourse,
this still results in his loss of being in communion. Such loss in
turn affects the institutional reality of Buddhist monasticism in its
internal and external dimensions, inasmuch as he can no longer
legitimately perform the function of perpetuating this monastic
institution by conferring valid ordination on others and would
also no longer be reckoned a meritorious recipient of individual
gifts by lay donors comparable to the way in which this was the
case before he had broken a _pārājika_ rule.

Now as Clarke (2009c: 116) rightly notes, "a monk who has
sex does not _necessarily_ commit a _pārājika_ offence." An example

37 This has already been pointed out by Sujato 2009: 122 note 192: "the _sikṣā_ 
_dattaka_ ( _sic_ ) is not, contra Clarke, 'in communion'." Wood 2012: 157f and
Kaplan 2016: 261, however, unreservedly accept Clarke's conclusions.

would be when a monk is mentally deranged or possessed and
therefore not considered accountable for what he does. But when
Clarke backs up his statement in his note 6 by stating: "Take, for
instance, the case of the _pārājika_ penitent or _śikṣādattaka_ ", followed by reference to his paper on this topic, then this does not
seem to work as a case of sexual intercourse not being considered
a breach of the respective _pārājika_ rule.

The _śikṣādattaka_ observance, in the way summarized by
Clarke based on what is common among the different _Vinaya_ s
that recognize this procedure, only institutionalizes the way in
which a monk who has offended against a _pārājika_ rule can continue to live in robes at a monastery in a position situated between
novices and fully ordained monks. [13] It does not change the nature
of the _pārājika_ offence itself. [38] One who has actually committed a
_pārājika_ offence is still no longer considered a fully ordained
monk according to these _Vinaya_ s. In fact, if these _Vinaya_ s did not
recognize that having sex, etc., entails a breach of the _pārājika_
rule, there would hardly have been any need for them to get into
devising the _śikṣādattaka_ option in the first place.


――――――
38 This would also hold for the case story related to the _śikṣādattaka_ observance

in the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ where, according to the detailed study by
Clarke 2009b: 16, the narrative unfolds in such a way that the monk is not considered to have committed a full breach of the _pārājika_ in the first place.
Therefore his being depicted as eventually becoming an arhat and with such
attainment then being reinstated from the _śikṣādattaka_ level to that of a fully
ordained monk would have no consequences for our understanding of what an
actual _pārājika_ breach implies, comparable in this respect to the matricide
story from the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ discussed earlier. Since neither involves a breach of a _pārājika_, they have no direct bearing on what such a
breach entails. The present story only implies that in the Mūlasarvāstivāda
_Vinaya_ the _śikṣādattaka_ observance could also be conferred on those who, due
to the circumstances of their deed, were not reckoned as having committed a
full breach of the _pārājika_ rule prohibiting sexual intercourse.


_Pārājika_  29


The institution of the _śikṣādattaka_ is in this respect comparable
to the option of becoming a novice, mentioned in the Pāli commentary, by confessing that one has lost one's status as a fully ordained monk. In its treatment of the first _pārājika_, the Pāli _Vinaya_
mentions that one of several ways a fully ordained monk can disavow his status is by declaring himself to be a novice. [39] Since at
the time of ordination he had received first the going forth, corresponding to novice ordination, and then the higher ordination as
a monk, this means he is giving up only the higher ordination, not
the going forth. This straightforward option does not appear to
have been felt to be in need of further legislation.

The same option is found in the Dharmaguptaka, Mahāsāṅghika, Mahīśāsaka, Mūlasarvāstivāda, and Sarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ s. [40]
All of these _Vinaya_ s recognize that a fully ordained monk, if he

of the proposal by Paṇḍita 2016 of two modes of disavowal of one's higher ordination, of which the supposedly earlier one did not involve any of the ways
described in the passage under discussion. Now the function of a word explanation ( _padabhājanīya_ ) in the _Vinaya_ is to explain and define, not necessarily to
promulgate something new. Thus the present word explanation only implies
that the listed ways of disavowal of one's higher ordination are from now on
those considered legally valid from the viewpoint of _pārājika_ casuistic. It does
not imply that these ways had never been in use earlier and only came into
existence with the arising of this commentary. Besides, the two examples
Paṇḍita 2016: 2f gives for the supposedly earlier mode of disavowal concern a
monk who mistakenly believes he has lost communion and a nun who has lost
communion and concealed it; neither is a case of a successful disavowal of the
higher ordination.

wishes to disavow his higher ordination, can do so simply by declaring himself to be a novice from now on.

This is similar to what can happen when a fully ordained monk
confesses according to the Dharma that he has violated a _pārājika_
rule. The main difference is that when a monk just decides to become a novice, for whatever reason, he can in principle at a later
time take full ordination again and thereby become once more one
who is in communion. If he becomes a novice after having committed a breach of a _pārājika_ rule, however, the option of becoming a fully ordained monk again is not open to him. He will no
longer be able to become one who is fully in communion.

Thus what happened with the _śikṣādattaka_ observance appears
to be that some _Vinaya_ s carved out a more institutionalized version of the basic option of remaining in robes at a level below that
of a fully ordained monk. This might have occurred in response to
an increase in the number of such cases, leading to a felt need for
more explicit legislation that also ensures that one who is willing
to confess and thereby incur the resultant loss of status as a fully
ordained monk can ensure that, following his demotion in status,
at least he will be placed within the monastic hierarchy above the
level of a novice. In several _Vinaya_ s the attractiveness of admitting a breach of a _pārājika_ seems in fact to have been increased
by offering a few additional privileges, while at the same time
keeping the _śikṣādattaka_ observance still clearly distinct from the
condition of being fully in communion.

This in turn gives the impression that the difference between
the Theravāda _Vinaya_, which does not know the _śikṣādattaka_ observance, and the other _Vinaya_ s, which do contain this option, is
mainly one of increasing degrees of institutionalization. It does
not appear to be a difference in principle. [14]

Therefore Clarke (2009b: 26) is probably right when he envisages, as one of several possibilities, that


_Pārājika_  31


the Pāli _Vinaya_ 's apparent ignorance of this ecclesiastical
provision may, in this case, reinforce the premise that it represents an older tradition, one which was transmitted to Sri Lanka
prior [to the arising of the _śikṣādattaka_ observance].


Clarke (2009b: 31) compares the case of the _śikṣādattaka_ observance to that of monastic regulations related to _stūpa_ s. Similarly
to the discourse on Dhammika translated above, where the Pāli
version did not mention the role of its monk protagonist in relation
to _stūpa_ s, the Pāli _Vinaya_ also has no reference to regulations in
this respect. This led Schopen (1989: 95) to the proposal that


the total absence of rules regarding _stūpa_ s in the Pāli
_Vinaya_ would seem to make sense only if they had been
systematically removed.

This suggestion earned him immediate criticism. [41] Instead, the
absence of any such reference rather shows that the Theravāda
_Vinaya_ was already closed by the time _stūpa_ s acquired sufficient
importance to require monastic legislation.

The same suggests itself for the _śikṣādattaka_ observance, in
that the move to institutionalize the monastic status of a monk
who has broken a _pārājika_ rule would have occurred only at a
time when the Theravāda _Vinaya_ was already closed. [42]

Lest I be misunderstood, with the foregoing suggestion I do
not intend to promote the attitude of considering the Pāli _Vinaya_

tions and the _śikṣādattaka_ training. However, he also brings in the _sikkhamānā_
training in this conclusion, where I find his overall treatment of this topic unconvincing; for two points of disagreement cf. Anālayo 2015a: 412 note 11
and 2016b: 97f note 23.

as invariably earlier than its parallels. In fact in my comparative
studies of the narratives related to the first and third _pārājika_ s in
the next two chapters I argue that the Theravāda account has incorporated later elements and is therefore definitely not the earliest version at our disposal. [43]

However, these are narratives shared by the different _Vinaya_ s,
which thus stand good chances of representing a common early
core, unlike stories found only in some _Vinaya_ s. [44] Such instances
show that the Theravāda _Vinaya_ is as much a product of the appropriation of later ideas and the embellishment of stories as the
other _Vinaya_ s. Yet, due to the idiosyncrasies of its transmission,
in the case of this particular _Vinaya_ the process of incorporation
appears to have come to a comparatively earlier point of closure
than in the case of its Indian brethren.

This in turn is significant for evaluating material not found in
the Theravāda _Vinaya_ at all, such as regulations concerning _stūpa_ s
and the _śikṣādattaka_ observance. Recognizing the significance of
such absence makes it possible to construct a reasonable chronology of developments in Indian Buddhist monasticism.

In other words, it seems fair to conclude that rules on _stūpa_ s
and the _śikṣādattaka_ observance are not found in the Theravāda
_Vinaya_ quite probably because they reflect comparatively later
concerns. They can certainly be considered as later concerns
than, for example, the notion that committing a _pārājika_ offence
equals immediate and definite loss of communion with the community of fully ordained monastics in the four directions, a notion reflected explicitly already in the code of rules of the different _Vinaya_ traditions. [15]

_Pārājika_  33

**Conclusions**

A fully ordained monk who willingly engages in sexual intercourse, without having given up his ordained status, is no longer
in communion. Such being no longer in communion happens
right at the time of the moral breach and does not have a necessary relationship to the monk's residential rights in a particular
monastery. It is only when the distinction between residential
rights and membership in the community of the four directions is
lost sight of that the clear-cut connection between a breach of a
_pārājika_ and the ensuing loss of communion becomes blurred.

The _Aṅguttara-nikāya_ does not recognize a form of atonement
for _pārājika_, just as the _śikṣādattaka_ observance does not imply a
re-evaluation of the nature of a _pārājika_ offence. Instead, the latter only involves an institutionalization of an option already available earlier, namely to continue to live at a monastery in robes but
without all the privileges that come with full ordination.

Similarly to the case of _stūpa_ regulations, the absence of references to the _śikṣādattaka_ observance in the Theravāda _Vinaya_
points to the relatively later date of the corresponding legislations.


## **Sudinna (Pār 1)**

**Introduction** [1]

In this chapter I study the function of _Vinaya_ narrative from
the perspective of its teaching context. [2] The example chosen for
this purpose occurs at the very beginning of the textual account of
the monastic rules, [397] namely the background narration to the
first of the _pārājika_ rules. [3] Due to the gravity of this offence, the
interdiction against sexual intercourse laid down in this rule must
have been considered of fundamental relevance by the members
of the early Buddhist coenobitical community. Hence the narration
that depicts the coming into being of this regulation must have
played a central role in the early Buddhist transmission and teaching of _Vinaya_ texts. [4] The present case can thus be reasonably well
expected to provide a good example for appreciating the function
of _Vinaya_ narrative.

Canonical versions of this narration are found in six different
_Vinaya_ s, namely those of the Dharmaguptaka, [5] Mahāsāṅghika,

Mahīśāsaka, Mūlasarvāstivāda, Sarvāstivāda, [6] [398] and Theravāda
traditions. [7] In the course of this chapter I will argue the importance of taking into account all extant versions, at least when the
aim is to draw conclusions of wider significance and arrive at an
assessment of Indian Buddhist monasticism in general. [8]

The Dharmaguptaka and Theravāda versions of the events that
led to the promulgation of the first _pārājika_ have already been
translated into English, [9] and a summary of the Sarvāstivāda version is available in German. [10] To complement these, in what follows I translate the Mahāsāṅghika, Mahīśāsaka, and Mūlasarvāstivāda versions, which to my knowledge have so far not been translated into a European language. I follow each translation with a
few observations and the last translation with a more detailed study.

the name of Yasa, [12] who out of faith had gone forth from the

11 The translated extract, T 1425 at T XXII 229a19 to 229b7, is preceded by a

reference to the place where the Buddha was staying at that time and followed
by a description of what happened after the monk in question had sexual intercourse. I have not translated these parts either here or in the other _Vinaya_ extracts below. Part of the Buddha's admonishment of the monk, reported in T
1425 at T XXII 229b25, has been translated by Ku 1991: 106.
12 T 1425 at T XXII 229a19 introduces the protagonist as 耶舍, the son of 迦蘭

陀. In other _Vinaya_ s the monk in question has the name Sudinna and is introduced as the son of Kalanda, T 1435 at T XXIII 1a10, or as an inhabitant of
the village Kalanda, T 1428 at T XXII 569c28, or as both T 1421 at T XXII

household to become homeless, abandoning the household life.
His father was named Kalanda, so his companions in the holy
life all called him "son of Kalanda". [399]

At that time there was a period of famine and it was difficult to get food by begging. Whenever the time for taking food
came, he would often return to his [family's] home for food.

[On one such occasion], his mother said to Yasa:

"Son, you are really suffering greatly, having shaved off
your beard and hair, wearing rag robes, holding a bowl to beg
for food, and becoming a laughing stock among people in the
world. Now in this house there is a great amount of property,
the money of your parents and the valuables of earlier generations, for you to do with as you like. Moreover, your beloved
wife is here now just as before. You should live with her together. Why experience all this strife and suffering like this?
You should return home and enjoy the five sense-pleasures.
You will be free to make offerings to gain all kinds of merit
and support the three jewels."

At that time Yasa said to his mother: "Please, mother, stop,
stop! I delight in cultivating the holy life."

His mother tried to persuade him for a second and a third
time, as at first, but Yasa replied as before.

The mother spoke once more seriously: [229b] "As you do
not delight in staying at home, I shall beg you to provide a
seed so that the family line may continue. Let this household
not be discontinued and our wealth lost to the government."

那, equivalent to Sudinna, comes up in the Mahāsāṅghika _Vinaya_ in the context of the rule against ordaining a woman without enquiring whether she is married; cf. T 1425 at T XXII 519b2ff. This 須提那 is not a monk, but a layman
who wants to get back his wife after she has gone forth without his consent.

At that time Yasa said to his mother: "Since you now wish
to make me leave a seed here, I accept this command."

The mother was happy and quickly entered the female quarters to tell the former bride: "Quickly adorn yourself. Dress
and adorn your body just as Yasa formerly liked it and go to
meet him."

The former bride replied: "Yes." She adorned herself in
turn as instructed and got ready. At that time Yasa enjoyed himself together with his wife, following the way of the secular
world. [400]


**Study of the Mahāsāṅghika Version**

The main elements of the Mahāsāṅghika _Vinaya_ account of the
occasion for the promulgation of the first _pārājika_ rule recur in the
other _Vinaya_ versions, in particular the motif of the sincerely dedicated monk who is persuaded by his mother to have intercourse
with his former wife in order to ensure the continuity of the family
line and its inheritance. The only noteworthy peculiarity of the
Mahāsāṅghika version is that its chief protagonist is called Yasa,
whereas the other versions agree in introducing him as Sudinna.

Similarly to the Mahāsāṅghika version, the Dharmaguptaka
and Sarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ s (not translated in this chapter) begin
their report by giving only brief indications about the protagonist's
personal background, adding the information that he stemmed
from a wealthy family, [13] something evident also in the later part
of the Mahāsāṅghika account.

The motif of his family's wealth receives further development
in the Mahīśāsaka and Theravāda _Vinaya_ s, which relate in detail
how Sudinna went forth. In what follows I translate the Mahīśāsaka version.

Sudinna (Pār 1)  39

**Translation of the Mahīśāsaka Version** [14]

At that time the householders of the city of Kalanda had
come to the town [of Vesālī] for some matter. Hearing that the
Buddha, the Blessed One, was staying at the Kūṭāgārasālā,
they all approached the Buddha. They saw that the Buddha,
the Blessed One, was teaching the Dharma surrounded by an
immeasurable crowd. [401]

A householder named Sudinna, the son of Kalanda, was
then among the crowd. Hearing the Dharma he was delighted
and had this thought: 'As I understand what the Buddha has
said, a man living at home, bound by affection and craving,
does not get to cultivate the holy life fully for the entire life.
Going forth and being without attachments is like being in an
empty space. Let me now go forth from the home life out of
faith and cultivate the path.'

When the various groups [of visitors] had returned, he approached the Buddha, paid respect with his head at the Buddha's feet and said: "Blessed One, just now as I heard the Buddha teach the Dharma, I had this thought: 'As I understand what
the Buddha has said, a man living at home, bound by affection
and craving, does not get to cultivate the holy life fully for the
entire life. Going forth and being without attachments is like
being in an empty space. Let me now go forth from the home
life out of faith and cultivate the path.' Blessed One, having
this thought, I now wish to go forth, please let me go forth and
receive the precepts."

The Buddha said: "Very well. Have your parents given permission?"

He replied: "They have not given permission."

The Buddha said: "It is a custom for all Buddhas that, without the parents' permission, one does not get to [cultivate] the
path [as a monastic]."

[Sudinna] said to the Buddha: "I will now return to inform
my parents." [2c]

The Buddha said: "Now is the right time for it."
Then Sudinna got up from his seat in turn, circumambulated

[the Buddha] three times and returned home. He said to his
parents: "I heard the teaching of the Buddha that living at home
one is in bondage to attachment. I wish to go forth now and
cultivate the holy life fully."

His parents replied: "Stop, Sudinna, do not speak like this.
Formerly we had no child and we prayed just to have you. You
are our only child, beloved and thought much of. Even if you
were dead we [would] not keep away from you. [402] How could
we separate from you when you are alive? There is much wealth
in your home, gold, silver, treasures, you can do meritorious
acts as you wish and enjoy pleasure in the present. What is the
use of going forth and taking away [from us] what we affectionately aspired to?"

He made his difficult request three times, [yet] his parents
did not allow it. He got up from his seat in turn and, standing
in another place, made an oath: "Unless I am able to go forth, I
shall not eat again. I will die right here. Of what use is it to go
on living?" At once he did not eat for six days. [15]

His relatives, who had heard about it, all came to convince
him, saying: "You are the only child of your parents, beloved
and thought much of. Even if you were dead they [would] not

keep away from you, not to mention separating from you while
you are alive. There is great wealth in your home, with which
you can perform meritorious deeds. Being on the path has to
do with the mind; it does not consist in [certain] appearances
and clothing. What need is there to endanger your life and afflict your parents by disobeying them?" It went like this three
times. He remained silent and did not accept it.

His friends kept on coming all the time, admonishing him
with bitter words, as above, but it was the same. They each
gave up and left him. They all approached the parents and said:
"As far as we can see, we cannot make him change. If you allow
him to go forth, you will probably see him at times. If he does
not delight in being one on the path, he will come back after a
while. He has been fasting for six days; if he continues, [403] his
life will come to an end. In a few days he will be discarded
amidst the fields, where owls and crows will peck at him, and
tigers and wolves will compete to eat him. As his father and
his mother, would you be able to bear this?"

Having heard this, the parents wept and said: "We permit
our son to go forth and cultivate the holy life, but he must promise to come back at times to see us."

Having heard this, [the friends and relatives] were all very
happy. They went to him again and said: "Your parents have
permitted you to go forth, but do not forget at times to come
back. You can in turn go."

Sudinna was very happy. He went to his parents and said:
"I will now approach the Buddha to go forth and cultivate the
path."

The parents wept and said: "We permit you to go forth and
cultivate the holy life fully, but do not forget, you must at times
come back and see us." Then Sudinna paid respect to his parents, circumambulated them thrice, and left.

He returned to the Buddha, paid respect at the Buddha's
feet, and told the Buddha: "Blessed One, my parents have allowed it. May I be given the going forth and receive the precepts."

The Buddha said: "Welcome, monk, practise all [aspects of]
the holy life, well taught by me is the Dharma for the eradication of all _dukkha_ ."

When the Buddha had said this, Sudinna's beard and hair
disappeared of themselves and he was wearing monastic robes
on his body and holding a bowl in his hands; he had become a
recluse and received the higher ordination.

Not long after he had gone forth, there was a period of famine. [3a] All the monks who entered the town to beg for alms
got nothing. While being in seclusion, Sudinna thought: 'Now
there is this famine and it is hard to get almsfood. In my native
place there are abundant beverages and food. [404] I should lead
the monks back to my home town, so that they get support,
give blessings, and deliver others.'

He rose from his seat in turn and with the monks together
returned to his home town. He stayed at the root of a tree in a
forest. His parents heard of it and ordered his wife: "Adorn
yourself, put on the clothes and ornaments that our son was
fond of when living at home." When she was fully adorned,
the parents led her to that forest.

Then Sudinna, seeing his parents coming, rose to receive
them. The parents said: "What is the use of ruining yourself by
staying among the trees in the forest? Come back, give up the
path and cultivate what is wholesome while living at home."

He replied to his parents: "I am unable to give up the path
and return to what is low." It went like this three times, but he
remained adamant. The parents cried, left him, and returned
home.


Sudinna (Pār 1)  43


After a few days, Sudinna's wife had in turn her period. Then
she told her mother-in-law. The mother-in-law was very happy.
She said: "This is a sign of [being able to conceive] a son." She
then ordered her to adorn herself as before with clothes and ornaments.

The parents again led her to the forest. Then Sudinna received them … ( _as above_ ) … [One of] the parents again said:
"What is the use of ruining yourself by staying among the trees
in the forest, afflicted by wind, dew, hunger, cold, and hardship?
Everyone knows that in your home there is wealth. Even just
my private treasures make a pile [so high] that a person's head
could not be seen [over it]. As for the wealth of both parents,
no one can count it. You can come back home and freely cultivate what is wholesome. Enjoy pleasure in the present and experience rewards in the future." [405]

He replied to his parents: "According to what your son has
seen, the five sense-pleasures are harmful for virtue. Their happiness is like lightning, [followed by] sadness and pain that
last for a long time. For this reason I will never give up cultivating the holy life." He sternly replied like this three times.

The parents said again: "Although you are our son, through
disobeying us and undertaking the path you have now become
one of the Sakyan clan. What more is there to say? Only that
your ancestors' lineage maintained by men of the same family
will cease. According to royal statute, when succession is discontinued, the wealth is lost to the government. We are finished.
Do you not know that our only remaining wish is for you to continue the lineage? Think about it. That is all we have to say."

Then Sudinna, hearing this order, wept. He became silent
and accepted their command. He went back in turn with his
wife and in their former abode engaged three times in sensuality.

**Study of the Theravāda and Mahīśāsaka Versions**

The above translated Mahīśāsaka version and the Theravāda
_Vinaya_ account differ from the narration in the Dharmaguptaka,
Mahāsāṅghika, and Sarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ s, none of which describes
how Sudinna went forth. In principle, such a difference could have
come into being because either the other three versions did not
consider it worthwhile recording under what circumstances the
protagonist had gone forth, or else the Mahīśāsaka and Theravāda
_Vinaya_ s added such a description.

Closer inspection makes it highly probable that the second of
these two possible explanations holds, in that we have here a case
of addition, since the tale of Sudinna's going forth does not fit well
with the remainder of the narration in the Mahīśāsaka and Theravāda _Vinaya_ s. [406] Both versions depict him as someone with little
concern for the wishes of his parents, willing to force them to consent to his plans by threatening to starve himself to death. This
depiction does not tally too well with the same person's willingness to accommodate the wishes of his parents to have an heir as
readily as reported in all of the _Vinaya_ s. Already at the time of
going forth as an only son the concern of his parents for the family
lineage and wealth to continue would have been a natural aspect
of the ancient Indian setting to be reckoned with and thus could
hardly have been something he had not been aware of earlier. [16]

16 His ready compliance to his mother's suggestion is remarkable even in view of

the fact that according to all accounts an explicit ruling against sexual intercourse had not been promulgated at this point. Yet, the inappropriateness of
engaging in sexual intercourse should have been self-evident to any Buddhist
monastic, even before an explicit regulation in this respect had come into
being. Dhirasekera 1982/2007: 86 explains that "even in the absence of any
restrictive regulations it seems to have been very clear to all members of the
Buddhist Saṅgha that … the offence of _methunadhamma_ contradicts the spirit
of true renunciation" so that "Pārājika I, which came to be laid down subse

The story of the sole son of a wealthy family who obtains permission to go forth by going on a hunger strike recurs in the _Raṭ_ _ṭhapāla-sutta_ and its parallels. [17] The Pāli version of this discourse
is so similar to the Theravāda _Vinaya_ account of Sudinna's going
forth as to be nearly identical.

This close similarity, however, results in further inconsistencies in the Theravāda _Vinaya_ narration. According to its report,
Sudinna's relatives had heard the news of his arrival and brought
ample supplies for him, which he passed on to other monks. [18]
Even though this makes it clear that news about his return had
already spread among his relatives, the tale continues by depicting how he is not recognized by his parents when he approaches
his own home, but only by a female slave working in the household. [19] [407] Moreover, the ample supplies brought for him and the
other monks do not fit smoothly with the ensuing description according to which, after not receiving any alms at his former home,
he contents himself with eating rotten food about to be thrown
away by the female slave of the house. [20]

quently, does no more than determine the gravity of the offence and the consequent punishment it involves." As pointed out by Voyce 1983: 317, Sudinna
"should have been aware that breaking celibacy was against the foundations of
_brahmacariya_ " in the Buddhist tradition. According to Tilakaratne 2009: 659,
"celibacy was understood in the tradition as an essential aspect of monastic
life which follows from the very logic of renunciation."

In contrast to the case of the _Raṭṭhapāla-sutta_, where these
elements suit the narrative progression well, in the case of the Sudinna account it seems as if a combination of textual pieces of differing provenance has created some degree of bumpiness in the
progression of the tale. Lupton (1894: 771) is quite probably correct when he concludes that the Theravāda version of the story of
Sudinna would have evolved based on the precedent set by the
_Raṭṭhapāla-sutta_ . [21]

In addition to the _Vinaya_ s surveyed so far, the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ also records the story of the coming into being of the
first _pārājika_ rule. [408] In what follows, I translate the relevant part
of the Mūlasarvāstivāda version, based on Yìjìng's (義淨) Chinese
rendering of this episode.

the counterpart to the reference to _pūtibhūta_ at Sp I 208,3 in T 1462 at T XXIV
712a25) and a parallel in the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_, edited in Matsumura
1985: 51,5, reports that the food was beginning to rot, _rul pa_ . I doubt the point of
taking the rotten food would have been to enable his parents to receive merit, as
this would presumably require some intention to give him food on their part.
21 Another point in support of this conclusion would be the declaration in [[AN1.75]] at AN I 24,18 that Raṭṭhapāla was foremost among the disciples of the
Buddha for going forth out of faith; cf. also Anālayo 2011b: 464 note 123.
Since the faithful motivation for going forth exhibited by Raṭṭhapāla is the
same as what the _Vinaya_ account associates with Sudinna, it seems as if, at the
time when Raṭṭhapāla was considered foremost in this respect, the Sudinna
tale had not yet come into existence in the way it is now found in the Theravāda _Vinaya_ . The observation by von Hinüber 1976: 36f, regarding a verb
form found in Vin III 17,28 as probably earlier than its counterpart in MN II
64,17, need not stand in contrast to the hypothesis that the Sudinna tale would
have incorporated narrative material from the Rāṣṭrapāla story, as a change of
the verb form in [[MN82]] could have occurred during the period of oral transmission of the _Majjhima-nikāya_ subsequent to [[MN82]] serving as the basis for
the _Vinaya_ account.


Sudinna (Pār 1)  47

**Translation of the Mūlasarvāstivāda Version** [22]

At that time, in the village of Kalandaka there was the son
of Kalandaka, called Sudinna. He was wealthy, having many
servants and abundant gold, silver, treasures, and grains, having stored up property and goods like the heavenly King Vessavaṇa. He had taken a wife from a clan of equal rank and dwelled
happily with her.

At a later time, deep reverence and faith in regard to the
Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṅgha had arisen in him. He
had taken refuge in the triple gem and undertaken the five precepts, which are: completely abstaining from any killing of
living beings, stealing, sexual misconduct, false speech, and
drinking any liquor. Because his reverence and faith gradually
became greater day by day, he in turn eventually left the household life out of right faith to become a homeless one, shaving
off hair and beard, and donning monastic robes.

Having gone forth, he dwelled in close association with his
kinsfolk, just as in former days when being at home, not different from that. [23 ] Then the venerable Sudinna reflected:

23 [[DN3]] _ca_ 22b7 or Q 1032 _che_ 20a5 similarly reads: _de de ltar rab tu byung nas_

_ʼdi lta ste, sngon khyim pa_ (Q: adds _de_ ) _bzhin du nye du rnams dang lhan cig_
_ʼdre zhing gnas so_ . I take this passage to mean that he associated with them
closely during the day, just as earlier when he was still living at home, which
he could do even if he were to stay overnight in some monk's hut nearby and
thus without living at home in the full sense of the expression. In view of the
previous references to him "leaving the household" and becoming a "homeless
one", if the reciters had wanted their audience to know that he was actually
living at home, they would probably have indicated this more explicitly, _pace_
Clarke 2014: 47, who holds that "Sudinna, having _left_ home, _appears_ to have
continued to live _at_ home." The present case seems similar to the description

'Have I not gone forth from the home in the well-taught
Dharma and discipline? [409] I should realize what I have not
yet realized, attain what I have not yet attained. [Yet] I am
dwelling in close association with my kinsfolk. I had better
leave now and separate from my kinsfolk, taking my robes and
bowl to wander in the countryside.'

Having thought this, he in turn left his kinsfolk and went to
another region, [where] he encountered a period of famine. Almsfood was difficult to get, [even] parents and children were unable to help each other, let alone have a surplus for beggars.

Then Sudinna had the thought: 'Now my kinsfolk have abundant money and food. It would be good if I were to be close to
the village of Kalandaka, advising [my relatives] to give extensive support to the Saṅgha as a field [of merit]. Be it with
broken rice or millet, [628b] whether as a constant offering of
alms, or by invitation for a meal, or as food given on the eighth

in close association, _saṃsṛṣto viharati_, with his family, Speyer 1902/1970:
207,2 (cf. also the parallels T 200 at T IV 221b16 and [[DN343]] _’am_ 103b2 or Q

continues with the Buddha sending him to the forest in order to "separate him
from association with householders", _gṛhisaṃsargān nivārya_, employing a
standard phrase found also in the early discourses whose sense is clearly not
about living with householders under the same roof. By suggesting that the
more natural reading of the above _Vinaya_ passage would similarly be mere
association with his family, I certainly do not intend to deny in principle that
there may have been Indian precedents for the eventual appearance of householder monks in Newar Buddhism; cf. Verardi 2011: 334. Nor do I see the
appearance of married clergy as a peculiarity of Nepalese Buddhism, as a
comparable development has made a brief appearance, e.g., in Sri Lanka; cf.
Malalgoda 1976: 54–58, and is still found nowadays, e.g., in Japan; cf. Jaffe
2001. My point is only that it seems improbable that the present instance intends
to depict a monk who actually lives at home.

and the fourteenth [or] fifteenth day. [24] I shall instruct my kinsfolk so that with a little meritorious act they will get much
benefit.' [410]

Then Sudinna in turn left that other region. Taking his robes
and bowl he wandered in stages until eventually he reached
the village of Kalandaka. He went to a forest close by and
stayed in a small hut.

Then Sudinna visited his kinsfolk and spoke widely to everyone in praise of the [triple] gems of the Buddha, the Dharma,
and the Saṅgha. He established them in providing support to
the great community and in gaining much benefit.

At that time Sudinna was dwelling in the forest, cultivating
the ascetic practices by having only three robes, which were rag
robes, always going to beg for alms, and begging in proper order.

Then his kinsfolk, each day [before] noon, had always been
offering superior, superb, and exquisite beverages and food to
the monastic community.

Sudinna took his robes and bowl to enter the village, begging in proper order, until he reached his former home. Not receiving anything, he left and went away. Sudinna's mother was
elsewhere attending to some matter. Then an old female slave
saw Sudinna from afar and recognized his facial features. She
realized that, having not received anything, he had quickly left.
The old female slave, having seen this, went to where Sudinna's
mother was and said:

"Lady, did you know your firstborn son Sudinna, who has
been away from his home town for a long time, just now came

back to his former home? He had come to beg and quickly left,
not getting anything."

Then Sudinna's mother thought: 'How could my son fail to
have fond memories? [Perhaps] he feels unhappy and wants to
return to the lay life, [411] no longer wanting to be a recluse and
experience the suffering of being a recluse. Is he ashamed of it,

[wanting] to give up the practice of a recluse?'

Having had this thought, she went in turn out of the village
to the place where Sudinna was living. She said: "Sudinna, do
you not have fond memories? Do you feel unhappy and want
to return to lay life, no longer wanting to be a recluse and experience the suffering of being a recluse? Are you ashamed of
it, [wanting] to give up the practice of a recluse?

"Sudinna, listen to what I say, in our house there is property and money for dowries. My own gold and silver, piled up,
is such a great heap that people sitting on either side of it cannot see each other. Your father also has been granted property
by the government, he has hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of millions of gold coins, besides various other
types of valuables. You can return home! Follow your sentiments and receive the pleasurable [benefits] of making merit
through giving."

When she had said this, Sudinna said to his mother: "I do not
have fond memories, I do not delight in returning to my former
household life. I do not dislike being a recluse or experiencing
the suffering of being a recluse, being ashamed of it and [wanting] to give it up."

On hearing these words, Sudinna's mother thought in turn:
'It is not within my ability to make him return to lay dress. I
should devise another plan.' Then his mother returned to the
house and told [Sudinna's former] bride: "When your period
comes, tell me." The bride promised to do so. [412]


Sudinna (Pār 1)  51


At a later time, when her period had come, she said:
"Lady, my period has now come. [628c] What do you want me
to do?"

Her mother-in-law said: "After bathing, adorn yourself with
wreaths of various flowers, apply fine perfume and put on necklaces, adorning your body and preparing it completely, just as
Sudinna liked and enjoyed it in the past, when he was living at
home."

Having heard this, the bride adorned herself all over, returned
to her mother-in-law, and said: "Lady, just as Sudinna liked it
in the past, so I have done it. Having bathed, I have adorned
my body and dressed. If there is something to be done, now is
the time for it."

Then Sudinna's mother and the bride went off together in a
chariot. They approached the place where Sudinna was staying
and, having reached it, they alighted from the chariot and approached on foot.

At that time Sudinna was outside a small hut, doing walking meditation. Having seen him, his mother said: "Sudinna,
since you say that you do not have fond memories … ( _to be_
_spoken in full as above_ ) _…_ now your bride's body is pure, [25] it

_Vinaya_ versions, except for the Sarvāstivāda account, T 1435 at T XXIII 1b2,
where the mother tells her daughter-in-law to inform her when her "period of
purity", 淨潔時, has come. Notably, the commentary on the reference to her
menstruation in the Theravāda _Vinaya_, Vin III 18,11, brings in the notion of
purity. Sp I 213,7 indicates that, once menstruation is over, conception can take
place in the "purified ground", _suddhe vatthumhi_ ; cf. also the translation in
Hara 2009: 244. Such a reference is, however, absent from the parallel passage in T 1462 at T XXIV 713a17, translated in Bapat and Hirakawa 1970:
158. On associations of menstruation with impurity cf. also Hüsken 2001 and
Langenberg 2016.

is ready to receive your seed. Let not our property be lost to
the government." [26] [413]

Then Sudinna, not seeing a fault in sensuality, as no rule
had so far been established, gazed at his young bride with affection. Lust and attachment arose, and his heart was burning
with sensual desire. He said to his mother: "Should we really
join in union?"

The mother said: "You should, so that your seed is received
properly." Then Sudinna took his former bride in turn by the
hands and led her to a secluded spot. He took off his monastic
robes and three times they engaged in the impure act.


**Study of the Mūlasarvāstivāda Version**

Similarly to the pattern observed above in relation to the Mahīśāsaka and Theravāda _Vinaya_ s, the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ account also seems to incorporate elements from a version of the
Raṭṭhapāla/Rāṣṭrapāla tale, such as the description of not receiving any food at the former home and thereupon leaving quickly,
as well as the motif of being identified by a female slave from the
family's household.

In the above setting, where Sudinna goes begging from house
to house, there is no particular reason for him to leave quickly just
because nobody is there. On realizing that nobody is there, he
might either move on at his normal pace or else even wait a little
in the hope that someone returns.

Again, with Sudinna having already lived in the vicinity long
enough so as to have inspired his family members to offer regular
supplies to the monastic community, there is not much of a need

26 As pointed out by Schopen 1995/2004: 190 note 35, an explicit reference to

the fact that heirless property will be seized by the government can be found

Sudinna (Pār 1)  53


for an explicit indication that the female slave recognizes him by
his facial features.

In contrast, in the different versions of the Raṭṭhapāla tale the
monk protagonist meets with abuse when he comes to his former
home, hence it is indeed meaningful for him to leave quickly. [27]
As it is his very first visit home after becoming a monastic and his
family does not recognize him, [414] recognition by the female slave
is a necessary step in the denouement of the tale. [28]

Nevertheless, in the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ version these
points are not really inconsistencies, but only elements that are
less natural in their present setting compared to the Raṭṭhapāla
tale. Overall, the Mūlasarvāstivāda account provides a narration
that is considerably more coherent than the Mahīśāsaka and Theravāda versions. Once Sudinna is from the outset depicted as someone who tends to associate closely with his family, it becomes
more natural if on a later occasion he is also willing to consent to
his mother's wishes.

The above surveyed variations between the canonical versions
of the Sudinna narration give the impression that the story of a
monk who has sex with his former wife at his mother's instigation
in order to preserve the family line was enlarged in the Mahīśāsaka and Theravāda _Vinaya_ s by incorporating the Raṭṭhapāla nar

27 His quick departure is reported in [[MA132]] at T I 624c3: 速出去, and in the

_ba myur bar phyir byung ngo_ .
28 Notably, the motif of the female slave recognizing Sudinna is also found in

the Sarvāstivāda _Vinaya_, T 1435 at T XXIII 1a22. This gives the impression
that perhaps some version of the Raṭṭhapāla tale (applied to Sudinna) was
known among the Sarvāstivāda and Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ reciters. Instead
of taking over the story as a whole, they only took over selected parts or a revised version for their respective canonical accounts of Sudinna.


54  _Vinaya_ Studies


ration, with the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ integrating only parts of
this narrative and as a result of that presenting a more coherent
account.

If this should indeed have happened, then such an evolution of
the Sudinna narration would be well in line with a general tendency of _Vinaya_ narratives, where tales intended to record the circumstances that led to a particular rule at times integrate narrative
pieces that stem from other textual collections. [29] That the tales
which provide the background to a _Vinaya_ rule are not necessarily
historic records has in fact been emphasized by various scholars
and is certainly nothing new. [30] [415] What would be worth exploring
further, however, is what might have motivated such narrative
developments.


――――――
29 Schlingloff 1963: 551 concludes that several examples he has surveyed show

"wie eine Geschichte aus einer Verordnung herausgesponnen und nach einem
festgelegten Schema entwickelt wird … in der weiteren Entwicklung werden
dann die Erzählungen durch eingefügte Episoden erweitert und ausgeschmückt;
neue Erzählungen, zum Teil aus anderen Sammlungen übernommen, lockern
das starre Schema auf"; on the Sudinna tale in particular cf. also Schlingloff
1962: 34.
30 Oldenberg 1879/1997: xxiii introduces his edition of the Theravāda _Vinaya_

with the remark that the stories are "undoubtedly pure inventions", which is
perhaps too wholesale a rejection of the possibility that some of them might
have a historical kernel. In fact, as Dutt 1924/1996: 25 points out, "some of
the legends may have had a kernel of historical truth … for some of the rules are
so curious and unthinkable in character, yet arise so naturally out of the stories,
that one is tempted to attribute some truth to the accompanying legends." Nevertheless, as noted by Dutt 1962: 76, "the legends in many instances are too
far-fetched and in others … so loosely adjusted to the rule that their invented
character becomes transparent." Misra 1972: 22 concludes that "legend and
tradition mixing with history is what one finds in some of the passages." Silk
2008: 7 note 9 comments that "we sometimes cannot escape the impression
that monks sat around saying to each other, 'Hey, what if _that_ happened?! What
then?'."


Sudinna (Pār 1)  55


One type of motivation can be seen with the stories one comes
across when continuing to read the narrative material associated
with the first _pārājika_ rule. As pointed out by Horner (1938/1982:
xxi) in relation to the detailed descriptions of ways in which the
vow of celibacy can be broken,


it is perhaps not necessary to believe that each or any of the
many and curious forms of unchastity, mentioned in Pārāijika
I., ever was actually perpetrated by a monk … [perhaps] at the
time of the final recension … all the deviations … of which
the recensionists had heard or which they could imagine, were
formulated and added. [31] [416]


The need to cover all possible cases of breaches of celibacy
would explain the coming into being of some of the case stories
attached to the exposition of the first _pārājika_ . Regarding the tale
of how this rule came about in the first place, one might then ask
why, assuming my above hypothesis is correct, would the Raṭṭhapāla narration have been added to the Sudinna tale? Why would
those responsible for the final shape of the story that purports to
record the historical circumstances of a rule standing at the very
heart of the early Buddhist coenobite community not just keep to
what they had received as 'facts' from their predecessors?

It seems to me that it is precisely the importance of this rule
that would have encouraged such additions, rather than ensuring
that the same tale was handed down with only minimal variations
by successive generations of monastic reciters in the different Bud

31 In a supplement to Horner's translation, Kieffer-Pülz 2001: 63 then notes that

possible cases, examples of … self-buggery … are given." In relation to the
various instances of intercourse with animals, etc., Faure 1998: 78f remarks
that "a too readily sociohistorical reading of passages of this kind … would …
rest … on a fundamental misunderstanding of the textual nature of the Vinaya."

dhist traditions. In fact, the differences surveyed above make it
quite clear that a _Vinaya_ narration like the Sudinna tale does not
function in a way that is comparable to a record of case-law
precedents in modern judicial proceedings. Instead, the stories
need to be understood in terms of their teaching function in the
context of legal education, that is, as an integral part of the _Vi-_
_naya_ project of inculcating the moral values believed to be en _-_
shrined in the rules and thereby fostering the corresponding behaviour among monastics.

Therefore, _Vinaya_ narrative inevitably reflects the needs and
requirements of this functional setting and needs to be clearly
recognized as a genre of its own. [32] From this perspective, then, it
is only obvious that a text like the _Mahāvastu_ should be reckoned
a _Vinaya_ text, [33] and it deserves no further comment that _jātaka_
and _avadāna_ tales found in this work were certainly not meant for
a lay audience only. [34] [417]

The distinct character of _Vinaya_ narrative can in fact be seen,
for example, in a recurrent trope that speaks of a notorious group
of six monks or a similarly notorious group of six nuns. [35] Several

IV 185,2. An exception to this pattern appears to be the section on the minor
training rules in the Mahīśāsaka _Vinaya_, T 1421 at T XXII 73c28, where the
group of six does not occur with the same frequency as in the other _Vinaya_ s,
although they regularly feature elsewhere in the same text.


Sudinna (Pār 1)  57


scholars have already pointed out that the invariable appearance
of the group of six as those responsible for various types of misbehaviour makes the historical value of the tales of their exploits
rather doubtful. [36] When considered from the perspective of the
function of _Vinaya_ narrative as an integral part of the education
and training of monastics, the question of historical accuracy becomes in fact somewhat irrelevant. [37] The real point of the trope of
the six monks or nuns would be to provide a textual signifier to
the audience that a story of bad conduct is about to be delivered.
Those even a little familiar with _Vinaya_ narrative will know only
too well that, when certain personalities like the group of six monks
or nuns are introduced, mischief can be expected. In an actual
teaching situation, then, the mere mention of the notorious group
of six creates an anticipation of yet another caricature of monastic
behaviour to be avoided. [418] Together with the providing of some
entertainment, this would help to keep the details of the respective
rule better in mind.

36 [35] Bhagvat 1939: 47f notes that "whenever any safeguard for an offence had

to be laid down, the offence was often 'made up' by linking it up with the almost imaginary figure of the Chabbagiya Bhikkhus and Bhikkhunis. The authenticity of these episodes, therefore, is doubtful." Barua 1968: 49 comments
that "many laws are made by linking them up with the Chabbagiya monks and
the nuns … thus the historical background of some of the Vinaya episodes are
(sic) doubtful." Gräfe 1974: x concludes that the fabricated nature of several _Vi-_
_naya_ tales in general is evident in the circumstance that the culprits are always
the same. Gokhale 1994/2001: 18 similarly sees it as "possible that the _Chabba-_
_giya_ episodes are manufactured after a favourite literary device." Cf. also, e.g.,
Dhirasekera 1970: 81, Sarkar 1981, Schopen 2007, Clarke 2009a, and Liu 2013
(with references to further literature).
37 [36] Regarding _Vinaya_ narrations, Freedman 1977: 20 explains that "the Bud
dhist tradition does not see itself as the preserver of mere historical data … while
likely rooted in certain historical events … the true aim … is rather a concern
with preserving the soteriological and hagiographical elements of the 'tradition'."

In the case of the first _pārājika_ rule, [38] the narrations that come
along with this rule have a rather important function within the
teaching setting in which they would most often have found employment. [39] Besides providing some engaging anecdotes that help
to teach a particular rule in an oral setting, the narration that comes
with a _pārājika_ rule is a rather weighty affair in view of the implications of the corresponding transgression.

Unlike the Jain tradition, where a monk's breach of celibacy
apparently had less dire consequences, [40] for a Buddhist monk to
be engaging in sexual intercourse, without having previously
given up his higher ordination, [41] results in irrevocable loss of
communion with the fully ordained members of the Buddhist
order. [42] As I have argued in the previous chapter, this refers to
communion with the fully ordained members of the monastic
order at any location, not only at a local level. [43] [419]


――――――
38 [37] It seems to me that the circumstance that celibacy is the first of the four

_pārājika_ offences for monks need not imply that "sex is the most serious monastic transgression", worse than killing or theft, _pace_ Gyatso 2005: 276; cf.
also a similar suggestion in Grero 1996: 67f. At least according to Sp I 213,12
and its parallel T 1462 at T XXIV 713a22, Sudinna's engaging in sex was just
the first of these types of misconduct to occur, that is, the order of enumeration could just be meant to reflect what was believed to be the historical sequence of the promulgation of _pārājika_ rules.
39 [38] Huxley 1999: 319f comments that probably "most of the time of a vinaya
dhara's job was to pass on vinaya-learning to his students", hence _Vinaya_ case
stories "can best be understood as documents generated by legal education".

Sudinna (Pār 1)  59


Although in principle a monk who has committed a _pārājika_
offence could according to most _Vinaya_ s still live in robes at any
monastery as a _śikṣādattaka_ or novice, [44] [420] he would no longer
be able to do so as a fully ordained monk. This does not apply to
Sudinna himself, however, as according to a basic _Vinaya_ principle a punishment is only possible when a corresponding rule is
already in existence, in line with the tenet _nulla poena sine lege_ .
Thus the original perpetrator of a misdeed goes unpunished. [45]

Given the importance of the _pārājika_ rule on sexual conduct, a
teacher of _Vinaya_ needs above all to make sure that his students
are fully aware of what can cause them to lose their monastic
status as fully ordained monks, clarifying when and in what way a
_pārājika_ offence is committed. Failing to do this properly would
be the worst blunder he could make, causing him to become
partly responsible for their loss of monkhood incurred through
lack of awareness about how this should be preserved intact. [46] [421]

45 Hecker 1977: 97 and von Hinüber 1995: 18; contrary to Faure 1998: 76 who

holds that "Sudinna was eventually expelled from the community." As far as I
can see, Faure bases his account of the Sudinna case on consulting the Dharmaguptaka _Vinaya_ and the Theravāda _Vinaya_ commentary (in Chinese translation: T
1462). In both traditions, however, the exposition of the first _pārājika_ in the actual _Vinaya_ s concludes by explicitly indicating that the original perpetrator is not
guilty, T 1428 at T XXII 572b4: 不犯者, 最初未制戒 and Vin III 33,32: _anāpatti_
_… ādhikammikassā ti_ . Powers 2009: 71 also concludes that Sudinna was expelled,
and that notably even though he is aware of "the general practice … to spare punishment of the first offender because there was no formal rule when the violation
occurred", yet he still argues that "because Sudinna's offense was so grave he was
expelled from the monastic community, with no possibility of reinstatement." It
hardly requires further comment when Powers 2009: 267 note 14 supports his
faulty conclusion by stating "I assume from the context and the Buddha's words
that Sudinna was expelled, even though the text does not explicitly state this."

Executing this teaching task, then, requires not only going
through all kinds of permutations of how celibacy can be broken,
graphically depicting what should be avoided. It also requires inculcating a keen awareness in the newly ordained monk that he
may easily be drawn into doing something that has rather grave
consequences.

The elements of the Sudinna tale held in common among the
different _Vinaya_ s already point to the need to beware of excessive
intimacy with one's former home for the sake of securing food
supplies in times of scarcity. Independent of the historical accuracy of the core elements of this story, after all it is quite possible
that the monk who occasioned this rule did impregnate his former
wife at the request of his mother, [47] the tale as it stands serves to
sound a stern warning to newly ordained monks against excessive
intimacy with their former kin. [48] Set against its ancient Indian con

ploys elements similar to the narrative found in those versions of the Sudinna
tale that share material with the Raṭṭhapāla account, here, however, employed
to depict how a preceptor saves his student from losing his monastic status. A
young man, the only son of the family, forces his parents to consent to his going
forth by fasting for a period of six days. When fulfilling his promise to visit
them as a monk, on account of his former wife he feels inclined to disrobe and
conveys this to his preceptor. During the ensuing night, his preceptor causes him
to have dreams in which he sees his wife dead and decomposing in a cemetery.
This vision fills him with such revulsion that, instead of disrobing, he eventually
becomes an arahant, after finding out that his wife has indeed passed away.
47 Perera 1993: 92 argues that the Sudinna tale could well be reporting an event

that did happen, pointing out that Vin III 35,30 reports another case of sexual
intercourse "involving a bhikkhu and his one-time wife … repetition of an identical incident … would be unnecessary unless the case was factual."
48 Holt 1981/1999: 90 comments that Sudinna "consents because he still retains

an abiding value in the wealth of his family's possessions and the continuation
of his family's material heritage." Wijayaratna 1990: 91 reasons that Sudinna
"lacked the courage to reject their proposal. He thought that his parents' wish
for an heir was legitimate." Blackstone 1995: 163 aptly sums up Sudinna's

text, the core tale of the Sudinna narration thus contrasts the ideal
of śramaṇic renunciation to the brahminical notion of a man's
duty in procreation. [49] [422]

The Mahīśāsaka and Theravāda _Vinaya_ s then add more weight
to this warning to be given to the newly ordained monk learning
the code of rules, as in their account the one who ends up committing a _pārājika_ is an outstanding and exemplary monk. [50] This
monk is so keen on going forth that he is willing to risk death in
order to get his parents' permission to exchange a life of luxury
and affluence for that of a mendicant who receives only rotten

failure to remain within the parameters of normative monastic conduct in the
following way: "because he is a dutiful son, he performs the duties of a husband, and becomes a father." Bayer 2012: 9 points out that "Sudinna finds
himself in a dilemma endangering his loyalty to either the word of his mother
or the (hitherto unspoken) rules of his order"; cf. also Heim 2014: 151–158.
49 Perera 1993: 230f points out that "according to ancient Indian tradition it was

obligatory for the husband to have sexual relations with his wife after her menstruation, while the wife herself was entitled to demand sex of her husband …
it is the same tradition that the Vinaya preserves, enshrined, as it were, in the
episode concerning Sudinna." Wilson 1996: 23f explains that the tale of Sudinna "dramatizes the tension that existed, in the early days of the monastic
community, between the goals of that community and those of the society
from which it drew its numbers … Brahminical culture invests the uninterrupted succession of sons with a profound religious significance … [thus]
Sudinna was faced with the difficult choice of committing an offense against
his ancestors or committing an offense … as a monk." To my mind the study
by Clarke 2014 of family-related dimensions of Indian Buddhist monasticism
does not change the basic situation as reflected by quotes in this and the preceding note, as he for the most part focuses on what appear to have been exceptional cases rather than the rule; cf. also below p. 94ff.
50 In Anālayo 2011b: 465 I argued that the soteriological function of [[MN82]] is

the depiction of an ideal monk, set in the _Majjhima-nikāya_ collection in between the depiction of an ideal lay supporter in the _Ghaṭikāra-sutta_, [[MN81]]
and the depiction of an ideal king in the _Makhādeva-sutta_, [[MN83]] for a study
of the ideal king motif in the parallels to [[MN83]] cf. Anālayo 2011e and 2012g.

food at the door of his former home (a recently ordained monk
sitting in the audience might well wonder if he would be capable
of a similar degree of renunciation). The message to a monastic
audience hearing this story seems quite clear: even a monk with
such a strong and sincere inspiration is not beyond danger.

The stark example provided in this way would go a long way
in driving home to newly ordained monks that they should not
think themselves to be beyond the possibility of infringement of
the first _pārājika_ regulation, just because they are sincerely dedicated to the monastic life. When considered in an actual _Vinaya_
teaching situation, the Mahīśāsaka and Theravāda _Vinaya_ s make a
rather significant contribution to an effective inculcation of the
need to beware of possible pitfalls related to this rule.

From this perspective, the Mūlasarvāstivāda version offers the
most successful of all accounts. The element of sincere inspiration is still quite evident; after all Sudinna does leave his family
behind on realizing that his attachment to them is an impediment
and goes wandering. [423] Furthermore he is described as observing several ascetic practices and an unannounced visit by his
mother finds him engaged in walking meditation. [51] But this element of sincere aspiration is integrated in a coherent presentation
of Sudinna as someone too close to his family and thus easily
drawn into acting in a way unbefitting a member of the Buddhist
monastic community.

The case of the Sudinna tale makes it clear that reading the
Theravāda version or the Mūlasarvāstivāda version in isolation

from its parallels can be misleading. Once this tale is studied based
on a comparison with all extant versions, it becomes apparent that
Sudinna's hunger strike in the Theravāda and Mahīśāsaka _Vinaya_ s
may reflect the concerns of _Vinaya_ teachers to add a dramatic
element that enhances the importance of caution in regard to this
rule. Similarly, the description of Sudinna's close association with
his family soon after having ordained, found solely in the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_, could just be a product of the narrative imagination of the Mūlasarvāstivāda reciters and can therefore hardly be
considered representative of the way Indian Buddhist monastics in
general actually related to their families.

In this way, the tale of Sudinna in the different _Vinaya_ s provides helpful indications regarding the function of _Vinaya_ narrative, which in turn has consequences on how _Vinaya_ narrative
should ideally be studied in order to be properly understood. As
Schopen (1994: 61) explains,


if _vinaya_ cases are neither fables nor historical accounts,
but rather the forms that _vinaya-_ masters chose narratively to
frame the issues that concerned them, then they do provide us
a record of such concerns and the various legal attempts to
solve them. [424] They do not, however, provide any direct
evidence for what actually occurred.


Needless to say, this assessment of the nature of _Vinaya_ narrative and the type of evidence it can provide then needs to be applied when studying this type of literature. As Finnegan (2009: 36
note 72) points out


the impulse to take textual discussions of financial instruments or institutional formations as indicative of their presence in the world around the [ _Vinaya_ ] text requires better hermeneutical grounding than has been provided so far. There is
simply nothing in this method of reading the text that prevents


64  _Vinaya_ Studies


one from taking the _MSV_ [Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ ] as offering proof of the existence of all manner of man-eating demon
in northwest India during that period, given the corroborating
evidence of statuary and other archaeological remains that also
refer to such creatures.


Keeping in mind the teaching function of _Vinaya_ narrative
helps to remain aware of the possibility that at least parts of the
stories may reflect the needs and concerns of those responsible
for the teaching, transmission, and codification of the different
_Vinaya_ s, not their actual experiences.

To be sure, this does not prevent the drawing of conclusions
based on circumstantial information that can be gathered from the
texts. Thus, for example, information on the nature of a dooropener in a monastic dwelling is certainly unproblematic. [52] Even
if the narration that comes with that description should turn out to
be merely a product of imagination, this imagination will still
reflect the type of door-openers used at the time the story came
into being. [53] A problem only arises with the type of information
that requires things to have happened as they are described in a
particular _Vinaya_ narrative and which would not work if the description turns out to be merely a product of imagination. [425]

In order to be able to appreciate the impact of the imagination
of the monks responsible for the transmission of the _Vinaya_, then,
a comparative study of all extant accounts emerges as an important
necessity. As the Sudinna case shows, it is through a comparative
study of all extant versions that those parts of the tale can be identified that with high probability reflect how the functioning of this
tale in a _Vinaya_ teaching setting would have influenced the shape

aspects of ancient Indian monasticism by von Hinüber 1992: 14–24.

the narrative eventually acquired. A telling case for the importance of taking into account a range of relevant texts involves
another narration related to the same topic of sexual intercourse,
namely the tale of an arahant monk accused by a nun of having
had sex with her. Generations of monastics and scholars have been
equally puzzled by the fact that, even though the monk successfully clears himself of the accusation, the nun has to face expulsion from the monastic order. [54] Such a punishment would only be
appropriate if she had indeed had sexual intercourse and thus committed a _pārājika_ offence, not if she only raised a false accusation.

The solution to the conundrum is as simple as unexpected. Based
on a thorough survey of the extant _Vinaya_ s, Clarke (2008: 118ff)
brilliantly solves the puzzle, pointing out that, according to a passage found in the Mahāsāṅghika _Vinaya_, the nun indeed had sexual intercourse, [426] but with someone else. [55] Having become pregnant, she then attributed her condition to the monk in question.

In view of such a state of affairs, it would indeed be only logical that she has to face punishment appropriate for one who has
committed a _pārājika_ offence, even though the monk successfully
cleared himself of the accusation. Presumably this significant detail of the narration, according to which she had already been
made pregnant by someone else, was lost at a very early stage in
the transmission of _Vinaya_ literature. [56]

This example corroborates that, as far as studies of Indian monastic Buddhism in general are concerned, a partial acquaintance
with the relevant sources is a methodologically weak foundation
for research. The results of such research stand good chances of
turning out to be irrelevant, if not misleading, once a proper comparative study based on all extant versions is undertaken.

With this suggestion I do not intend to raise criticism of studies whose parameters are clearly set within a particular tradition,
such as, e.g., interpretations of a particular regulation at different
stages in the history of Theravāda Buddhism or else of Tibetan
Buddhism, etc. But studies that attempt to draw conclusions about
Indian monastic Buddhism in general need to take full account of
all texts at our disposal in order to be able to yield the type of
reliable information that can become the basis for further scholarly research. [427] As Clarke (2009b: 38) points out,


if, then, we are interested in providing a balanced and
nuanced picture of Indian monastic Buddhism, it seems certain
that we will need to take the evidence provided by all extant
monastic codes seriously, and this in turn will mean that the
_Vinaya_ s other than the Pāli will warrant much more attention

tiyā's _pārājika_, for whatever reason they did not feel a need to mention it", adding in a footnote that "at the commentarial level this nun's _pārājika_ seems to
have been no longer known." It seems to me that this also holds for the Theravāda _Vinaya_, not only for the Pāli commentaries, as at Vin III 163,4 the monks,
who had instigated her, plead against her expulsion on the grounds that she had
not committed an offence, admitting that they had set her up to make the false
accusation, _māvuso mettiyaṃ bhikkhuniṃ nāsetha, na sā kiñci aparajjhati_, _am_  _hehi sā ussāhitā_ . This formulation gives the impression that, at the time this part
of the Theravāda _Vinaya_ came into being, her punishment was already believed
to be related to the act of false accusation and not to her having committed a _pā_  _rājika_ offence and hence deserving expulsion on that account.


Sudinna (Pār 1)  67


This conclusion holds not only for studies based on the Theravāda _Vinaya_ preserved in Pāli, but all the more for studying the
Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_, where besides the Tibetan translation
and the Sanskrit fragments, considerable parts are extant in a
Chinese translation. [57] Since here we appear to be dealing with
different recensions of this _Vinaya_, [428] the need to take into

57 On the value of the Chinese Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ cf., e.g., de Jong 1968/

1979: 235, who notes that "en comparant les versions chinoise et tibétaine du
_Vinaya_ des Mūlasarvāstivādin, on a souvent reproché à Yi-tsing d'avoir supprimé des passages. Les manuscrits de Gilgit prouvent qu'il a dû traduire une
recension plus brève. Pour cette raison la version de Yi-tsing garde sa valeur
par rapport à la version tibétaine et surtout pour les passages qui ne sont pas
représentés dans les manuscrits de Gilgit." Nevertheless, the negative assessment of this translation among some scholars continues, for a recent instance
cf. Mejor 2010: 675 note 18, who speaks of the "mediocre value of the Chinese MSV [Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ ] translation", quoting in support opinions collected in Eimer 1983a: 33f (which were originally published in the
1950s and thus previous to the paper by de Jong), as well as a recent paper by
Clarke 2002. A perusal of the paper by Clarke does not seem to support such
an assessment, in fact in a personal communication (email 24-12-2010) Clarke
confirms that this does not represent his position, clarifying that "there are, or
should be, two questions here: completeness and quality. That Yijing's translation, at least as it has come down to us, is incomplete is clear; the question is
about the quality. Too often it has been assumed that the differences between
Yijing's text and the Sanskrit and Tibetan were Yijing's fault (mistranslation,
etc). But it is probably only the case that we do not have the Sanskrit text that
Yijing was working with. We have something close, but not identical … I see
no reason to set aside Yijing's Chinese. In fact, Yijing's Chinese allows us philological control when the Sanskrit is difficult or corrupt or missing and the
Tibetan not particularly clear." Clarke 2015: 74 then sums up that when "the
quality of Yijing's translation has sometimes been called into question … [then]
such characterizations are based on two problematic assumptions: that the
Sanskrit and/or Tibetan texts that have come down to us were similar or even
identical to those used by Yijing and that there was only ever a single, stable
Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya tradition."

account the version preserved in Chinese, whenever extant, becomes even more pressing.

An illustrative example is the account of the founding of the
order of nuns. The Chinese version of the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vi-_
_naya_ has a long section on how the Buddha had benefitted his
fostermother which is not found at all in the Sanskrit and Tibetan
versions. [58] This constitutes a major difference that has considerable effects on the whole narration. In view of such differences,
how could we presume to be making meaningful statements even
just about the Mūlasarvāstivāda account of this event without consulting its different extant recensions?

In sum, as a conclusion to this study I contend that it is only
based on a comparative study of all extant versions and based on
keeping in mind the function of _Vinaya_ narrative that it will be possible to avoid painting an image of the historical conditions of Indian Buddhist monasticism that is just a reflection of monastic
(and scholarly) imagination.

## **Migalaṇḍika (Pār 3)**

**Introduction**

In the first part of the present chapter I examine versions of a
narrative that accompanies the third _pārājika_ rule on killing and
assisting in suicide. The narrative concerns a mass suicide by
monks disgusted with their own bodies, which reportedly happened after the Buddha had praised seeing the body as bereft of
beauty, _asubha_ . I argue that this episode needs to be understood
in the light of the need of the early Buddhist tradition to demarcate its position in the ancient Indian context vis-à-vis ascetic
practices and ideology.

The mass suicide by monks is found in discourse and _Vinaya_
texts. This is significant for appreciating the respective roles of
these two types of literature, a topic that I will explore in detail in
the second part of this chapter, in dialogue with observations made
in a monograph by Clarke (2014) on family matters in Indian Buddhist monasticism.

In this way, the two main topics I will cover are the mass suicide of monks and the relationship between discourse and _Vinaya_
literature. [12]


**The Mass Suicide of Monks**

In what follows I begin with the discourse versions that report
the mass suicide of monks, based on translating one of these
found in the _Saṃyukta-āgama_ . Then I study the narrative in comparison with six extant _Vinaya_ versions.

**Translation of the** _**Saṃyukta-āgama**_ **Discourse** [1]

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying in a
Sāla tree grove alongside the river Vaggumudā, by a village of
the Vajjīs. [2] At that time the Blessed One spoke to the monks
on contemplating the absence of beauty ( _asubha_ ); he praised
contemplating the absence of beauty, saying: "Monks, one who
cultivates contemplating the absence of beauty, cultivates it
much, attains great fruit and great benefit." [3]

Then, having cultivated contemplating the absence of
beauty, the monks exceedingly loathed their bodies. Some
killed themselves with a knife, some took poison, some
hanged themselves with a rope or committed suicide by
throwing themselves down from a crag, some got another
monk to kill them. [4]

A certain monk, who had given rise to excessive loathing
and aversion on being exposed to the absence of beauty, approached *Migadaṇḍi[ka], the son of a brahmin. [5] [13] He said

the preceding sentence, according to which the Buddha spoke in praise of cultivating _asubha_ .

to *Migadaṇḍi[ka], the son of a brahmin: "Venerable, if you
can kill me, my robes and bowl will belong to you." [6]

Then *Migadaṇḍi[ka], the son of a brahmin, killed that
monk. Carrying the knife he went to the bank of the river
Vaggumudā. [207c] When he was washing the knife, a Māra
deity, who stood in mid-air, praised *Migadaṇḍi[ka], the son
of a brahmin:

"It is well, it is well, venerable one. You are attaining
innumerable merits by being able to get recluses, sons of the
Sakyan, upholders of morality and endowed with virtue, who
have not yet crossed over to cross over, who have not yet been
liberated to be liberated, getting those who have not yet been
stilled to attain stillness, getting those who have not yet [attained] Nirvāṇa to attain Nirvāṇa; and all their monastic possessions, robes, bowls, and various things, they all belong to
you."
――――――

_miga_ . The second part 林 could refer to a "forest", _dāva_ / _dāya_, _vana_ or _ṣaṇḍa_ /
_saṇḍa_, which could then reflect the name *Mṛgaṣaṇḍi[ka]. The Chinese
counterpart to the _Samantapāsādikā_, T 1426 at T XXIV 744c22, however,
renders his name as 鹿杖 (note that Sp II 399,15 gives his name as Migaladdhika, whereas Vin III 68,21 speaks of Migalaṇḍika). The rendering 鹿杖
is also found in versions of the present event in the Mahāsānghika, Mūlasarvāstivāda, and Sarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ s, T 1425 at T XXII 254b11, T 1442 at
T XXIII 659c28, and T 1435 at T XXIII 7c4. The use of 鹿杖 suggests, as
noted by Bapat and Hirakawa 1970: 292 note 21, an original *Mṛgadaṇḍi[ka]. As already suggested by Horiuchi 2006 (in an English summary of
his paper given on page 120 of the journal; due to my ignorance of Japanese
this is the only part of his research that I have been able to consult) the reading 鹿林 in [[SA809]] would originally have been 鹿杖. This could well be the
result of a scribal error confounding 杖 and 林, two characters that can easily
get mixed up with each other; in fact the reference to 鹿杖 in T 1442 at T
XXIII 659c28 has 林 as a variant for 杖.
6 Such a tale is not found in [[SN54.9]] although it does occur in the Theravāda

_Vinaya_, Vin III 68,21.


72  _Vinaya_ Studies


Then, having heard this praise, *Migadaṇḍi[ka], the son of
a brahmin, further increased his evil and wrong view, thinking:
'I am truly creating great merit now by getting recluses, sons
of the Sakyan, upholders of morality and [endowed] with virtue, who have not yet crossed over to cross over, who have not
yet been liberated to be liberated, getting those who have not
yet been stilled to attain stillness, getting those who have not
yet [attained] Nirvāṇa to attain Nirvāṇa; and their robes, bowls,
and various things all belong to me.'

Thereupon he went around the living quarters, the areas for
walking meditation, the individual huts, and the meditation
huts, holding in his hand a sharp knife. On seeing monks he
spoke in this way: "Which recluses, upholders of morality and
endowed with virtue, who have not yet crossed over can I get
to cross over, [14] who have not yet been liberated can I get to
be liberated, who have not yet been stilled can I get to attain
stillness, who have not yet [attained] Nirvāṇa can I get to attain Nirvāṇa?"

Then all the monks who loathed their bodies came out of
their monastic living quarters and said to *Migadaṇḍi[ka], the
son of a brahmin: "I have not yet attained the crossing over,
you should [make] me cross over, I have not yet attained
liberation, you should liberate me, I have not yet attained
stillness, you should get me to attain stillness, I have not yet
attained Nirvāṇa, you should get me to attain Nirvāṇa."

Then *Migadaṇḍi[ka], the son of a brahmin, killed the
monks one after another with his sharp knife until he had
killed sixty men.

At that time, on the fifteenth day, at the time for reciting
the rules, the Blessed One sat in front of the community and
said to the venerable Ānanda: "What is the reason, what is the


Migalaṇḍika (Pār 3)  73


cause that the monks have come to be few, have come to decrease, have come to disappear?"

Ānanda said to the Buddha: "The Blessed One spoke to the
monks on cultivating contemplation of the absence of beauty, he
praised contemplating the absence of beauty. Having cultivated
contemplation of the absence of beauty, the monks exceedingly loathed their bodies … _to be spoken in full up to_ … he
killed sixty monks. Blessed One, this is the reason and the
cause why the monks have come to be few, have come to decrease, have come to disappear.

"May the Blessed One give them another teaching so that,
having heard it, the monks will diligently cultivate wisdom
and delight in receiving the true Dharma, delight in abiding in
the true Dharma."

The Buddha said to Ānanda: [7] "Therefore I will now teach
you step by step [how] to abide in a subtle abiding that inclines to awakening and that quickly brings about the stilling
of already arisen and not yet arisen evil and unwholesome
states. It is just as a heavy rain from the sky can bring about
the stilling of arisen and not yet arisen dust. [8] In the same way,
monks, cultivating this subtle abiding can bring about the
stilling of all [already] arisen and not yet arisen evil and
unwholesome states. [208a]

"Ānanda, what is the subtle abiding which, being much
cultivated, inclines to awakening, and which can bring about
the stilling of already arisen and not yet arisen evil and unwholesome states? [15] It is: abiding in mindfulness of breathing."

7 In [[SN54.9]] at SN V 321,10 the Buddha has Ānanda first convene all the monks

who live in the area of Vesālī.
8 The corresponding simile in [[SN54.9]] at SN V 321,25 only mentions dust that

has already arisen, not dust that has not yet arisen.

Ānanda said to the Buddha: "How does cultivating the
abiding in mindfulness of breathing incline one to awakening
and bring about the stilling of already arisen and not yet arisen
evil and unwholesome states?" [9]

The Buddha said to Ānanda: "Suppose a monk dwells in
dependence on a village … _to be spoken in full as above up_
_to_ … he trains to be mindful of breathing out [contemplating]
cessation." [10]

When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what
the Buddha had said the venerable Ānanda was delighted and
received it respectfully. [11]


**The** _**Vinaya**_ **Versions**

In addition to the _Saṃyukta-āgama_ version and its _Saṃyutta-_
_nikāya_ parallel, representing discourse versions from a Mūlasar _-_
vāstivāda and a Theravāda line of transmission, [12] the same story
occurs in six _Vinaya_ s as part of their exposition of the _pārājika_
rule regarding killing a human being. These are the Dharmagup _-_
taka, Mahāsāṅghika, Mahīśāsaka, Mūlasarvāstivāda, Sarvāstivāda,
and Theravāda _Vinaya_ s.


――――――
9 In [[SN54.9]] at SN V 322,3 this question is part of the Buddha's own speech,

instead of being posed by Ānanda.
10 The reference is to a preceding discourse in the _Saṃyukta-āgama_ collection,

which gives the sixteen-step scheme for mindfulness of breathing in full. In
the _Saṃyukta-āgama_ this scheme has cessation as its last step, whereas in the
Pāli parallel the last step is letting go; cf. [[SN54.1]] at SN V 312,19 and, for a
translation and comparative study of the corresponding exposition in Mahāsāṅghika and Mūlasarvāstivāda canonical texts, Anālayo 2007, 2013c: 227–
237, and 2016f.
11 Instead of the standard conclusion, reporting the delight of the audience, [[SN54.9]] at SN V 322,10 concludes with the Buddha repeating his introductory
statement on the benefits of mindfulness of breathing practised in this way.
12 On the school affiliation of the _Saṃyukta-āgama_ cf. Anālayo 2015e: 1 note 1.


Migalaṇḍika (Pār 3)  75


In agreement with the other _Vinaya_ s, [13] the Theravāda _Vinaya_
reports that the monks were killed by a certain person; his name
in the Pāli version is Migalaṇḍika. The _Saṃyutta-nikāya_ discourse,
however, does not mention this episode. This has the unexpected
result that there is a prominent discrepancy between two versions
belonging to the same Theravāda canon. [16]

A variation in this aspect of the tale occurs also within the textual corpus of the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_, where the story can
be found twice: once in the _Vinayavibhaṅga_ for _bhikṣu_ s and again
in the _Vinayavibhaṅga_ for _bhikṣuṇī_ s. The Chinese translation of
the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinayavibhaṅga_ for monks has the *Migadaṇḍi[ka] tale, whereas the _Vinayavibhaṅga_ for nuns does not
mention *Migadaṇḍi[ka] at all. [14] The corresponding passages in
the Tibetan translation of the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_, however,
give this tale on both occasions, that is, in the _Vinayavibhaṅga_ s
for monks and for nuns. [15] This makes it clear that the short version in the Chinese translation of the _Vinayavibhaṅga_ for nuns


――――――
13 In what follows I take up only selected differences, as a full comparative study

of all versions is beyond the scope of this chapter.
14 In contrast to the detailed description of *Migadaṇḍi[ka]'s killings in the _Vina_ 
_yavibhaṅga_ for monks, T 1442 at T XXIII 659c28, the actual story in the _Vin_  _ayavibhaṅga_ for nuns is very short. The part that comes after the Buddha's recommendation of the practice of _asubha_, and before his enquiry into why the
monks have become so few, reads as follows, T 1443 at T XXIII 923b17 to
923b20: "The monks in turn contemplated the absence of beauty. After having
cultivated it, they gave rise to thorough disgust with their bodies [full] of pus
and blood. Some took a knife to kill themselves, some took poison, some hung
themselves with a rope, some threw themselves down from a high rock, some
killed each other in turn. At that time the community of monks gradually decreased." This account has no allusion to an intervention by *Migadaṇḍi[ka].

must be an abbreviation, as the whole tale has already been given
in the preceding _Vinayavibhaṅga_ for monks.

Returning to the Theravāda canonical sources, the circumstance
that the _Saṃyutta-nikāya_ discourse occurs among collected sayings on mindfulness of breathing could have been responsible for
a shortened narrative introduction to what in this context is the
main theme, the sixteen steps of mindfulness of breathing. In a
collection of discourses on this meditation practice, it is indeed
relevant to show the function of mindfulness of breathing as a
remedy for excessive disgust with the body, whereas the details of
how the monks killed themselves are not as relevant. In contrast,
in the Theravāda _Vinaya_ the issue at stake is killing and assisting
suicide, hence it is natural to find more attention given to the activities of Migalaṇḍika.

The _Saṃyutta-nikāya_ discourse itself reports that the monks
_satthahārakam pariyesanti_ . [16] Some translators understand this
expression to imply that they were looking for someone to kill
them. [17] On this reading, the present passage would then reflect
implicit knowledge of the Migalaṇḍika tale. [17] Yet this under

――――――
16 [[SN54.9]] at SN V 320,22.
17 Rhys Davids and Stede 1921/1993: 674 translate the term _satthahāraka_ as "an

assassin" and Bodhi 2000: 1773 renders the whole phrase _satthahārakam pa_  _riyesanti_ as "they sought for an assailant"; cf. also Ṭhānissaro 1994/2013: 87,
who argues that "the word _satthahāraka_ clearly means 'assassin' in other parts
of the Canon (see, for example, [[MN145]])." Yet the significance of the expression in [[MN145]] at MN III 269,12 is not really self-evident; cf. Gombrich 2014.
One of the Chinese parallels to [[MN145]] T 108 at T II 503a6, appears to be
based on a similar Indic expression, reading 求刀為食, where the use of 刀
makes it clear that the translator understood the phrase to refer to a tool for
killing, not a killer (as part of my comparative study of [[MN145]] in Anālayo
2011b: 830 note 50 I briefly noted this expression in T 108, without in that
context having the time to proceed to a closer study of the significance of the
corresponding Pāli phrase).


Migalaṇḍika (Pār 3)  77


standing of the phrase seems doubtful, and others have taken it to
refer to looking not for a killer, but for a means to kill themselves. [18] On this understanding, the _Saṃyutta-nikāya_ discourse
would be without an implicit reference to the Migalaṇḍika episode, similar to the case of the Chinese Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ _vibhaṅga_ for nuns.

In principle it is of course possible that the Theravāda _Vinaya_
version is an expansion of the account in the _Saṃyutta-nikāya_ . [19]
In this case the _Saṃyutta-nikāya_ discourse would preserve an earlier version of the tale and the _Saṃyukta-āgama_ discourse and the
_Vinaya_ s later versions that have incorporated the tale of *Migadaṇḍi[ka].

However, this seems to me to be the less probable explanation,
given that the _Saṃyutta-nikāya_ discourse and the Theravāda _Vi_ _naya_ share a story of the Buddha going on retreat, [20] which is not
attested in any of the other versions. [21] The story of the Buddha's


――――――
18 Cf. Gombrich 2014. Woodward 1930/1979: 284 translates the phrase _sat_ 
_thahārakam pariyesanti_ as "sought for a weapon to slay themselves", and
Hecker 1992/2003: 367 similarly as "sie suchten eine Waffe, um sich umzubringen." Delhey 2009: 90 note 70 draws attention to the gloss on _satthahā_  _raka_ at Vin III 73,26 in support of taking the term to refer to a weapon instead
of an assassin.
19 This has been suggested by Delhey 2009: 91 note 70.
20 [[SN54.9]] at SN V 320,12 and Vin III 68,6 report that the Buddha had gone on a

retreat for two weeks, giving the explicit order that nobody was to approach
him except for the person bringing him almsfood.
21 The Mahīśāsaka _Vinaya_ reports that the Buddha had just risen from his medi
tation when he discovered that the community of monks had diminished, T
1421 at T XXII 7b21: 從三昧起. This does not seem to refer to a meditation
retreat, but only to a rising from his daily meditation practice. If a comparable
reference should have been found at an earlier point in the Theravāda version
as well, it could easily have given rise to the idea of the Buddha going on a
whole retreat.


78  _Vinaya_ Studies


retreat clearly shows that the two Theravāda versions did not develop in isolation from each other. This makes it in turn more
probable that the absence of details on the Migalaṇḍika episode in
the _Saṃyutta-nikāya_ discourse would be intentional, in the sense
of reflecting an adjustment to the teaching context of the discourse as part of a collection of instructions on mindfulness of
breathing. [18]

Be that as it may, the report shared by the _Saṃyutta-nikāya_
discourse and the Theravāda _Vinaya_ that the Buddha had gone on
a retreat is also significant in another way. The arising of this
motif points to a need to reconcile the disastrous results of the
monks attempting to engage in something the Buddha had recommended with the traditional belief that the Buddha was an outstanding and skilful teacher. [22] The Pāli commentaries in fact build
precisely on this retreat in their attempt to explain how such a
grievous outcome could have happened. [23]
――――――
22 According to an epithet in a standard formula in the early discourses, the

Buddha is the supreme trainer of persons to be tamed; cf., e.g., [[MN27]] at
MN I 179,2 and its parallel [[MA146]] at T I 656c28 (on the apparent confusion underlying the Chinese rendering of this phrase cf. Nattier 2003: 227).
Bodhi 2013: 9f describes the traditional belief to be that the Buddha is able
"to understand the mental proclivities and capacities of any person who comes
to him for guidance and to teach that person in the particular way that will
prove most beneficial, taking full account of his or her character and personal circumstances. He is thus 'the unsurpassed trainer of persons to be
tamed'", in that his "teaching is always exactly suited to the capacities of
those who seek his help, and when they follow his instructions, they receive
favourable results."
23 According to Spk III 266,31 and Sp II 397,11, the Buddha knew that, due to

past deeds, these monks had accumulated the karma of being killed. Not being
able to prevent it, the Buddha decided to withdraw into solitary retreat. The
commentaries also record an alternative explanation according to which the
Buddha went into retreat foreseeing that some might try to blame him for not
intervening in spite of his claim to be omniscient.


Migalaṇḍika (Pār 3)  79


The mass suicide of the monks becomes particularly problematic once the Buddha is held to have been omniscient. [24] Although
in the present case this is exceptionally evident, the same holds
for most _Vinaya_ narratives in general. These often feature the
Buddha in the role of a law-giver who does not seem to foresee
possible complications and therefore is repeatedly forced to adjust
his rulings. Such a depiction is not easily reconciled with the belief that he was omniscient. [25]

Probably the same belief in the Buddha's omniscience leads
the Pāli commentaries to explain that, when the Buddha asked
Ānanda what had happened, he did so knowingly. [26] [19] That is, he
enquired only for the sake of getting the conversation started. Explicit indications that the Buddha enquired knowingly, not out of
ignorance, are also found in the Dharmaguptaka _Vinaya_, the Chinese translation of the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinayavibhaṅga_ for nuns,
and the Sarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ . [27]
――――――
24 Mills 1992: 73 remarks that the "Commentator grapples with the dilemma of

proclaiming the Buddha omniscient on the one hand … while showing him
doing nothing to stop his monks committing suicide"; for a more detailed study
of the notion that the Buddha was omniscient cf. Anālayo 2014c: 117–127.
25 Gombrich 2007: 206f points out that "the idea that the Buddha was omniscient

is strikingly at odds with the picture of him presented in every Vinaya tradition", according to which "the Buddha … occasionally made a false start and
found it necessary to reverse a decision. Since omniscience includes knowledge of the future, this is not omniscience." That tradition had to grapple with
this problem can be seen in the dilemma raised at Mil 272,18.
26 Spk III 268,25 and Sp II 401,25. Mills 1992: 73 notes that here "the Commen
tator arrives at another difficult point: explaining why the Buddha asked Ānanda
where the monks had gone. If he was omniscient he knew already; if not, then
he would be like ordinary people who need to ask … such complications always follow from claims to omniscience."

Coming back to the *Migadaṇḍi[ka] tale, the Mahāsāṅghika
_Vinaya_ differs from the other versions in so far as it presents this
episode right at the outset. [28] It begins by reporting that a monk
who had been very sick asked his attendant to help him commit
suicide. The attendant passed on this request to *Migadaṇḍi[ka]. [29]
*Migadaṇḍi[ka] killed the monk, but then felt remorse. [30] A Māra
deity appeared and praised him for the killing, after which he
went around offering to kill monks. It is at this point only that the
Buddha gives a talk on the absence of beauty, [31] which then motivates the monks to take up *Migadaṇḍi[ka]'s offer to help them
across by killing them.

According to the Mahāsāṅghika, the Mūlasarvāstivāda, and the
Sarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ s he killed up to sixty monks. [32] The number
sixty occurs also in the Dharmaguptaka, Mahīśāsaka, and Thera

1435 at T XXIII 7c15: 知故問. In Anālayo 2014a: 46f I argue that the addition
of such a phrase in the case of a _Dīrgha-āgama_ discourse is probably the outcome of commentarial influence, which may well hold also for the present
case, in view of the similar indication being found in Spk III 268,25 and Sp II
401,25.

30 His remorse for the first act of killing is also reported in the Dharmaguptaka,

Mahīśāsaka, and Theravāda _Vinaya_ s; cf. T 1428 at T XXII 575c28, T 1421 at
T XXII 7b7, and Vin III 68,28 (in these versions this occurs after the Buddha
had commended contemplation of _asubha_ ). According to Sp II 399,26, he had
approached the Vaggumudā river, whose waters were believed to be auspicious, in order to wash away not only the blood, but also the evil he had done.

32 T 1425 at T XXII 254b25, T 1442 at T XXIII 660a13 (with its Tibetan counter
part in [[DN3]] _ca_ 134a3 or Q 1032 _che_ 120a7), and T 1435 at T XXIII 7c13. As
part of Ānanda's report to the Buddha, T 1425 at T XXII 254c3 explicitly specifies that during a fortnight sixty men were killed, and T 1442 at T XXIII 660a21
reports that he killed a total of sixty monks.


Migalaṇḍika (Pār 3)  81


vāda _Vinaya_ s, but here this is the maximum number of those he
killed in a single day. [33] [20] This results in a much higher count of
casualties. According to the _Samantapāsādikā_, commenting on
the Theravāda _Vinaya_, he killed five hundred monks in total. [34]

Although the Dharmaguptaka _Vinaya_ does not give a total count
of the killings, it also depicts the situation as rather dramatic. In a
description without counterpart in the other versions, it reports that
the laity got so upset at the monastery being full of dead bodies like
a cemetery that they decided to stop supporting the monks. [35]

Together with the higher number of casualties, this attests to a
tendency to dramatize the event, probably reflecting the development of the narrative in a _Vinaya_ teaching context for the purpose
of inculcating the need to avoid such suicidal behaviour. The more
dramatic the tale, the better the lesson will be learned.

the story with the belief in the Buddha's omniscience and the ap――――――

34 Sp II 401,21.
35 T 1428 at T XXII 576a14 to 576a20: "Then in that monastic dwelling there

was a disarray of corpses; it was a stinking and impure place, being in a condition like a cemetery. Then householders, paying their respects at one monastery after the other, reached this monastic dwelling. Having seen it, they were
all shocked and jointly expressed their disapproval: 'In this monastic dwelling
an alteration has taken place. The recluses, sons of the Sakyan, are without
kindness or compassion, killing each other. They claim of themselves: "We
cultivate the true Dharma." What true Dharma is there in killing each other in
this way? These monks even kill each other, let alone other people. From now
on we will no longer worship, respect, and make offerings to the recluses, sons
of the Sakyan.'" For an alternative translation of this passage cf. Heng Tao et
al. 1983: 67. On the conflict between the need of Buddhist monastics to ensure
lay support by maintaining a proper public image and modes of monastic conduct related to the dead and cemeteries cf. Schopen 2006.

parent tendency towards dramatization so as to improve on its
effect on the audience, the main thread of the tale is the same in
the two discourse versions and the six _Vinaya_ versions. The gist
of the story thus would be as follows:

The Buddha recommends the practice of contemplation of
_asubha_ . In all versions he only gives such a general recommendation, without providing detailed instructions. The monks engage in
this on their own and presumably in a way that lacks the balance
that would have come with full instructions. [36] As a result of this,

[21] [ they are so disgusted with their own bodies that they commit ]
suicide, on their own or with assistance. On being informed of
this, the Buddha intervenes and stops the monks from going so far
as to kill themselves.


**Early Buddhism and Ancient Indian Asceticism**

Even when shorn of dramatic elements found only in some
versions and after setting aside the belief in the Buddha's omni

――――――
36 Spk III 265,22 and Sp II 393,22 relate the Buddha's recommendation on culti
vating _asubha_ to contemplating the anatomical parts. In [[MN10]] at MN I 57,20
and its parallel [[MA98]] at T I 583b9 such contemplation of the anatomical
parts of one's own body comes together with a simile that describes looking at
a container filled with grains; cf. also the _Śikṣāsamuccaya_, Bendall 1902/1970:
210,8, and the _Arthaviniścaya-sūtra_, Samtani 1971: 24,4. This simile seems to
convey nuances of balance and detachment, instead of aversion; cf. in more
detail Anālayo 2003: 149 and 2013c: 68. In fact in early Buddhist meditation
theory contemplating the body as _asubha_ comes together with other practices
that relate to the body in a different way, resulting in an anchoring in the body
through postural awareness and in the experience of intense bodily joy and
happiness with the attainment of absorption; cf. in more detail Anālayo 2014h.
The present case shows a similar counterbalancing, where an attitude of loathing the body finds its antidote by anchoring mindfulness in the body through
awareness of the breath, thereby implicitly fostering a more skilful attitude
towards the body.


Migalaṇḍika (Pār 3)  83


science, the tale of the monks' mass suicide is still perplexing. Its
depiction of the practice of _asubha_ going overboard to the extent
that monks commit suicide needs to be considered within its cultural and religious context.

Among ancient Indian ascetic traditions in general, suicide
was considered an appropriate means in certain circumstances; [37]
particularly famous in this respect is a Jain practice often referred
to as _sallekhanā_, where the accomplished saint fasts to death under the supervision of his teacher(s). [38] Keeping in mind this context helps to comprehend better the idea of helping monks who
have not yet crossed to cross over by assisting them in suicide.

Not only does suicide appear to have been an accepted practice among some ancient Indian recluses, but an attitude of disgust towards the body also seems to have been fairly commonplace in ascetic circles. [39] The disgust the monks in the above tale
came to feel towards their own bodies finds illustration in several
_Vinaya_ versions in a simile. This simile describes a youthful person fond of ornaments who finds the carcass of a dead snake, [22] a
dead dog, or even of a human corpse hung around his or her neck. [40]

Notably, this rather stark simile recurs in a discourse in the
_Aṅguttara-nikāya_ and its parallels to describe the attitude of a
fully awakened one towards his own body. The narrative context

concerns the arahant Sāriputta, who has to defend himself against
a wrong accusation by another monk. Sāriputta illustrates his mental attitude by comparing it to each of the four elements (earth,
water, fire, and wind), which do not react when any dirt or impurity is thrown on them. Other comparisons take up the docile
nature of a dehorned ox or the humble attitude of an outcaste.
Then Sāriputta uses the imagery of having the carcass of a dead
corpse hung around one's neck to illustrate how he is "repelled,
revolted, and disgusted with this foul body", that is, his own
body. [41] Similar statements can be found in two _Āgama_ parallels. [42]

In the case of another reference to "this foul body", however,
the parallel versions do not have such a reference. Here a nun,
who also appears to be an arahant, [43] replies to Māra who tries to

_yāmi_ ) _harāyāmi jigucchāmi_ . When considered within its context, the statement seems a bit out of place. The earlier similes, found also in the parallel
versions, illustrate a balanced and non-reactive attitude, where the elements do
not react with aversion towards anything impure. The present simile instead
conveys a reaction, and a rather strong one at that. The simile thereby does not
fulfil the purpose of illustrating a non-reactive attitude. This leaves open the
possibility that during oral transmission the earlier references to the elements
bearing up with impure things might have attracted the present simile, since it
is also concerned with the topic of impurity. This remains speculation, however, since similar statements are found in two parallels; cf. the note below.
42 [[MA24]] at T I 453c13: "I frequently contemplate the foul and impure parts of

this body with a mental attitude of being embarrassed and ashamed and filled
with utter disgust", 常觀此身臭處不淨, 心懷羞慙, 極惡穢之, and [[EA37.6]] at
T II 713b1: "I am disgusted with this body", 厭患此身.
43 The description in [[SN45.4]] at SN I 131,12 indicates that she had gone beyond sen
sual desire and desire related to the form and formless realms, which would imply
that she had become an arahant. The parallels are more explicit in this respect. [[SA1204]] at T II 328a11 indicates that she had eradicated the influxes ( _āsava_ ; for a discussion of which cf. below p. 325ff), and SĀ [2] 220 at T II 455b21 reports that she
had cut off all craving; for a translation of [[SA1204]] cf. Anālayo 2014d: 128f.

tempt her with sensuality. According to the Pāli version, she proclaims herself "repelled and revolted by this foul body". [44] Two
parallel versions of her reply to Māra do not have a corresponding
expression. [45] [23] In these discourses she expresses her lack of interest in sensual pleasure without bringing up a loathing for her
own body and without qualifying her body as foul. [46]

The variation found in this instance seems to reflect some
degree of ambivalence in the early Buddhist texts vis-à-vis the
ancient Indian ascetic attitude of being disgusted with the body,
something that is also evident from other passages.

The need to avoid the excesses of asceticism already forms a
theme of what according to tradition was the first discourse given

46 Another occurrence of the "foul body" in [[SN22.87]] at SN III 120,27, here used

by the Buddha to refer to his own body, also does not recur in the parallels. In
this case, however, the parallels do not have a counterpart to the entire statement
that in [[SN22.87]] leads up to the expression. In [[SA1265]] at T II 346c1 the Buddha's instruction follows a different trajectory and [[EA26.10]] at T II 642c20 does
not report any instruction at all; for a comparative study cf. Anālayo 2011f. Sirimane 2016: 160 seems not to have fully understood my comparative study of
[[SN22.87]] as she criticizes me for maintaining that in the Pāli version Vakkali
was an arahant before committing suicide. In my study I rather traced how the
different versions negotiate the basic tension between the condition of an arahant
and the committing of suicide. Sirimane 2016: 160 backs up her assessment by
referring to my paper on Dabba's suicide, [[UD8.9]] rather than the one on Vakkali,
[[SN22.87]] (both papers are listed in her bibliography). Her reference is to Anālayo 2012c: 165, where I note the contrast between the cases of Channa, Vakkali, and Dabba on the one side, and the Buddha's decision to pass away on the
other side, which did not lead to "ambivalence in later tradition regarding the
possibility that an awakened one could take the decision to end his or her own
life". This is not a statement on the particular presentation found in [[SN22.87]]

by the Buddha after his awakening, which sets aside asceticism as
one of the two extremes to be avoided. [47] The Buddha's claim to
have reached awakening after giving up asceticism met with a
rather hesitant reaction from his first five disciples. This exemplifies the difficulties of getting the Buddhist path to awakening acknowledged in a setting dominated by ascetic values.

The _Mahāsakuludāyi-sutta_ and its parallel report that, on
being praised for his ascetic qualities, the Buddha clarified that
some of his disciples were considerably more ascetic than himself. [48] His non-conformance to ascetic values as a Buddha is to
some extent made up for by his pre-awakening practices, where
he is on record as having himself tried out breath control and
fasting. [49] Other ascetic practices and a life of total seclusion
from human contact, described in the _Mahāsīhanāda-sutta_, apparently reflect experiences as an ascetic in previous lives. [50] [24]

50 [[MN12]] at MN I 77,28 and its parallel T 757 at T XVII 597a13. The allocation

of these ascetic practices to a past life emerges from Jā 94 at Jā I 390,16, noted
by Hecker 1972: 54. [[MN12]] at MN I 77,23 introduces these practices simply
as something from the past, without this necessarily being the past of the same
lifetime of the Buddha, and at MN I 81,36 then turns to other experiences the
Buddha had in former lives. As already pointed out by Dutoit 1905: 50 and
Freiberger 2006: 238, several of the austerities listed in [[MN12]] would in fact
not fit into the account of events before the Buddha's awakening. His dwelling
in solitude was such that he went into hiding as soon as any human approached
from afar, which does not square with the traditional account that he was in
the company of the five who later became his first disciples. His undertaking
of ritual bathing three times a day does not match the description of dust and
dirt accumulating on his body over the years to the extent of falling off in
pieces. The depiction of his practice of nakedness stands in contrast to his


Migalaṇḍika (Pār 3)  87


The Buddha's personal acquaintance with asceticism is also reflected in iconography, where his emaciated body after prolonged
fasting is vividly depicted. [51] [25]

The need to accord a proper place to ascetic values within the
Buddhist tradition has also found its expression in the form of the
_dhutaṅga_ s. These comprise such activities as wearing rags as robes,
subsisting only on almsfood, dwelling at the root of a tree, staying
in a cemetery or just living out in the open, not reclining (even at
night), accepting any type of accommodation, and taking one's
meal in a single session per day. [52]

The tension in early Buddhism between the need to accommodate ancient Indian asceticism and not going too far in that direction is well exemplified in the two figures of Mahākassapa and
Devadatta. Mahākassapa features as an outstanding disciple renowned for his asceticism. [53] Devadatta is on record for having


――――――

wearing different ascetic garments. Such a variety of ascetic practices could only
be fitted into a whole life of asceticism, as reported in the _Jātaka_ account, not
into the few years of austerities practised by the Buddha-to-be before his
awakening. Although Bronkhorst 1993/2000: 22 comments that "it is hard to
see in what other context this part could originally have existed", taking into
account Jā 94 suggests that it could have originated as an account of ascetic
practices undertaken by the Buddha in a previous lifetime, thereby documenting that his rejection of such practices was based on having himself tried them
out and found them not conducive to liberation.

caused the first schism in the early Buddhist tradition through his
request that some ascetic practices be made binding on all monks. [54]

It is against this background of ancient Indian ascetic values
that the significance of the _Vinaya_ tale of the mass murder of
monks and its relation to the _pārājika_ rule on killing can be properly appreciated. The tale is best understood in the light of the
need of the early Buddhist tradition to define its position in the
ancient Indian context vis-à-vis ascetic practices and ideology.

Now the _pārājika_ rule itself concerns intentionally depriving a
human being of life and assisting others in committing suicide, or
inciting them to kill themselves. Together with the actual rule, the
accompanying narrative in the _Vinaya_ has an important function
for inculcating Buddhist monastic values. This is particularly so
for a _pārājika_ rule, an infringement of which involves loss of
one's status of being fully ordained. [55] Therefore _pārājika_ rules
and the stories that come with them can safely be expected to
receive special attention in the training of a monastic. [56] [26]

In view of this I take it that the main issue at stake is to demarcate the early Buddhist monastic identity in contrast to ancient Indian asceticism. The story is on purpose so dramatic, in order to
ensure that newly ordained monks who are being taught the narrative context of the _pārājika_ rule regarding killing clearly understand what it means to go too far. The vivid details of the drama

56 This is reflected, e.g., in Vin I 96,22, which reports that the four _pārājika_ s should

be taught right after full ordination has been received, in order to make sure that
the newly ordained monk knows what must be avoided and thus preserves his
status as a fully ordained _bhikkhu_ .


Migalaṇḍika (Pār 3)  89


throw into relief the importance of a balanced attitude that leads
beyond sensuality without resulting in self-destructive tendencies.

The need to avoid killing living beings in general was commonly accepted in ancient Indian ascetic and recluse circles as
part of the overarching value of non-violence, _ahiṃsā_ . It would
therefore have been less in need of illustration through the main
narrative that comes with the corresponding rule. It seems to me
therefore natural that the story related to this rule takes up in particular the issue of assisting suicide, instead of killing in general,
to throw into relief the importance accorded in early Buddhism to
a middle path of balance. In sum, the final versions of the tale of
the mass suicide of monks are probably best understood as being
strongly influenced by narrative requirements resulting from a
_Vinaya_ teaching context.

In the previous chapter I took up the narrative that comes with
the _pārājika_ rule against sexual intercourse, concerning the monk
Sudinna, concluding that this narration sets early Buddhist monasticism in contrast to the brahminical notion of a man's duty to
procreate and warns against excessive intimacy with one's own
family. [57] In the present case of the _pārājika_ rule against killing a
human being, the narrative depicts excesses in ascetic values, resulting in a loathing of one's own body to the extent of wishing to
commit suicide. [58]

In a way, these two tales can be seen to negotiate the need of
the early Buddhist monastic community to carve out a clear-cut
identity in distinction to contemporary brahmins and to ascetically inclined recluses. [27] The two narrations throw into relief
these two extremes to be avoided, sensuality and excessive con――――――

cern with family on the one hand and self-destructive asceticism
on the other hand. They thereby reiterate the contrast between the
two extremes to be avoided that stands at the outset of what according to tradition was the first discourse spoken by the Buddha.
With these two _Vinaya_ narratives, the two extremes come alive
through showcasing monastics going off the middle path.

Unlike the depiction of Sudinna's breach of celibacy, the story
about the mass suicide of monks is also found in two discourses,
alongside the six _Vinaya_ versions. This difference brings me to
the second part of my study, namely assessing the potential of
reading _Vinaya_ literature compared to reading the discourses.


_**Vinaya**_ **Material in Discourse Literature**

A perusal of the early discourses soon makes it clear that these
regularly contain _Vinaya_ -related material. This holds not only for
the _Saṃyutta-nikāya_, which has the story of the mass suicide of
monks, but also for each of the other three _Nikāya_ s. [59] The _Mahā_ _parinibbāna-sutta_ in the _Dīgha-nikāya_ is a prominent example,
apparently being the result of a wholesale importation of what
originally was a _Vinaya_ narrative. [60] The same discourse in fact
records the promulgation of a new type of rule against an obstinate monk and the application of this rule is then reported in the
Theravāda _Vinaya_ . [61] The promulgation of this rule is also found
in the discourse parallels to the _Mahāparinibbāna-sutta_ . [62]

The _Mahāparinibbāna-sutta_ does not stand alone in this respect.
A similar pattern can be observed in the _Alagaddūpama-sutta_ in the

_Majjhima-nikāya_, whose depiction of another obstinate monk finds
its complement in the Theravāda _Vinaya_ 's report of how he should
be dealt with. [63] [28] His obstinate behaviour is also taken up in the
_Madhyama-āgama_ parallel to the _Alagaddūpama-sutta_, [64] as well as
in the Dharmaguptaka, Mahāsāṅghika, Mahīśāsaka, Mūlasarvāstivāda, and Sarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ s. [65] In this way the _Mahāparinib_ _bāna-sutta_ and the _Alagaddūpama-sutta_, together with their parallels, point to a close interrelation between discourse and _Vinaya_
literature as a feature common to various schools.

The _Alagaddūpama-sutta_ is not the sole instance of _Vinaya_
material in the _Majjhima-nikāya_ . The _Sāmagāma-sutta_ offers
detailed explanations on how to implement seven ways of settling
litigation ( _adhikaraṇa-samatha_ ) in the monastic community; tradition reckons these seven to be part of the _pātimokkha_ . [66] The
seven ways of settling litigation recur in the parallels to the _Sāma_ _gāma-sutta_ as well as in the _prātimokṣa_ s of other schools. [67]

The _Bhaddāli-sutta_ and the _Kīṭāgiri-sutta_ in the same _Majjhi_  _ma-nikāya_ feature monks who openly refuse to follow a rule set

in their respective discourse parallels, [69] and the story of Bhaddāli's refusal recurs also in the Mahāsāṅghika _Vinaya_ . [70]

The seven ways of settling litigation are also listed in the _Aṅ_  _guttara-nikāya_, [71] which moreover contains a series of discourses

with questions and answers on various legal technicalities ranging
from the ten reasons for the promulgation of rules to the topic of
schism. [29] This section closely corresponds to a section in the

Pāli discourses. Clearly the mass suicide of monks is not unique
in this respect and there seems to have been no definite and fixed
dividing line between _Vinaya_ material and the discourses.

Turning to the Pāli _Vinaya_ itself, according to the _aniyata_
regulation a trustworthy female lay follower can charge a monk
with a breach of a rule and such evidence requires the _saṅgha_ to
take action. [75] The _prātimokṣa_ s of other schools agree in this respect. [76] This confirms that, in regard to knowledge about breaches
of rules and related _Vinaya_ matters, the Buddhist monastic legislators did not operate from the perspective of a clear-cut divide
between laity and monastics, nor were their concerns solely dominated by the wish to maintain a good reputation among the laity.

In the case of the mass suicide of monks, the fact that we only
have two discourse versions may well be due to the vicissitudes
of transmission, as a result of which we do not have access to
complete discourse collections of those schools of which we have
at least a _Vinaya_ . In the case of another _Vinaya_ narrative found in
the _Aṅguttara-nikāya_, concerning the foundation of the order of
nuns, [77] we in fact have not only two discourse parallels preserved
in Chinese translation, [78] but also a reference to yet another such
discourse version in the Mahāsāṅghika _Vinaya_ . [79] [30] The reference clearly shows that a record of this event was found among
the Mahāsāṅghika discourse collections. This further confirms the

overall impression that the textual collections were not based on
keeping _Vinaya_ -related material apart from discourses meant for
public consumption. Instead, these two types of literature appear
to be rather closely interrelated and the tale of the mass suicide of
monks is just an example of a recurrent tendency.


**Family Matters in Pāli Discourses**

In order to corroborate my conclusion that information on monastic issues can be found not only in _Vinaya_ texts, but also in the
discourses, in what follows I turn to another topic that comes to
the fore also in the Sudinna episode that forms the background to
the _pārājika_ against sexual intercourse, discussed in the last chapter, namely its warning against excessive intimacy with one's own
family. Unlike the case of the mass suicide of monks, Sudinna's
breach of celibacy to ensure the continuity of his family line is
not recorded in the early discourses, but only in different _Vinaya_ s.

The topic of how Indian Buddhist monastics relate to their
families has been explored in detail by Clarke (2014: 162), who
identifies "privileging of _sūtra_ - and in particular Pāli _sutta_ - over
_vinaya_ literature", in combination with some preconceptions, as a
major factor contributing to the construction of a scholarly misconception regarding the nature of Indian Buddhist monasticism. [80]
Clarke (2014: 153 and 163) therefore advocates that, whereas in
his view so far "we have placed all of our eggs in one basket, the
_Suttapiṭaka_ of the Pāli canon", instead

80 Clarke 2014: 17 notes that the misunderstanding he has targeted "cannot be

attributed, solely, to the privileging of one type of canonical text over another
(i.e., _sūtra_ over _vinaya_ ) … rather, I suggest that it stems from selective reading within the corpus of privileged traditions and genres, a selectivity guided
by preconceived notions about what Buddhist monasticisms should look like

we need to go off the sign-posted and well-trodden highways of Buddhist _sūtra_ literature and continue to explore the
still largely uncharted terrain of 'in-house' monastic codes such
as the _Mūlasarvāstivāda-vinaya_ .


The scholarly misconception he targets is best summarized
with an excerpt from the dust jacket of his study: [31]


Scholarly and popular consensus has painted a picture of
Indian Buddhist monasticism in which monks and nuns severed all ties with their families when they left home for the
religious life … This romanticized image is based largely on
the ascetic rhetoric of texts such as the _Rhinoceros Horn Sutra_ .
Through a study of Indian Buddhist law codes ( _vinaya_ ), Shayne
Clarke dehorns the rhinoceros.


In the context of the present chapter it is not possible to do full
justice to Clarke's monograph, which would require a proper review. [81] Hence in what follows I only take up what is relevant for
my discussion of _Vinaya_ narrative. In relation to the story of the
mass suicide of monks, of particular interest is the relationship
between discourse and _Vinaya_ material, given that this story is
found in both genres.

One issue here would be to see how far scholarly misconceptions regarding Indian Buddhist monasticism are indeed related to
privileging Pāli discourse material. The best way to go about this
would be to see what the Pāli discourses in the four main _Nikāya_ s
have to say on family matters. Of course, given that discourses
have a considerably lower percentage of narrative material when
compared to _Vinaya_ material, it is impossible to find a similar
wealth of tales and stories in both types of literature, especially as

detailed background narratives are often found only in the commentaries. Nevertheless, a quick perusal of the Pāli discourses, by
no means meant to be exhaustive, does bring to light a few relevant indications. [82]

The _Mahāpadāna-sutta_ of the _Dīgha-nikāya_ acknowledges the
importance of family relations in its description of past Buddhas.
In addition to reporting the names of the mother and father of
each Buddha, [83] it also depicts the recently awakened Vipassī deciding to teach first of all his half-brother, the prince Khaṇḍa,
who then became one of his two chief disciples. [84]

The importance of family relations in a past life of the present
Buddha comes to the fore in the _Mahāgovinda-sutta_, according to
which he went forth together with all of his forty wives. [85] The discourse concludes with an evaluation of the practice undertaken by
the bodhisattva at that time. [32] This conclusion does not in any
way express criticism of the act of going forth together with all of
his wives. [86]

In his present life the Buddha then is on record as approaching
his son Rāhula for a visit. [87] On other occasions he goes to beg together with his son or goes to meditate together with him. [88] According to the _Aggañña-sutta_, Buddhist monks in general should
consider themselves as sons of the Buddha, born from the Bud――――――

dha's mouth. [89] The imagery of the disciples being the sons of the
Buddha recurs again in the _Lakkhaṇa-sutta_ . [90]

The _Raṭṭhapāla-sutta_ shows the monk Raṭṭhapāla intending to
visit his family. The Buddha, realizing that it will be impossible
for Raṭṭhapāla to be lured back into lay life, gives his explicit permission. [91] In conjunction with the other passages surveyed so far,
this episode clarifies that there is no problem as such in associating with members of one's family, as long as this does not compromise essential aspects of one's monastic role, such as celibacy.

Other passages provide similar indications, if they are read
taking into account the background information provided in the
commentaries. [92] One example is the _Cūlavedalla-sutta_ 's record of
a long discussion between the nun Dhammadinnā and the layman
Visākha, who according to the commentary was her former husband. [93] When the discussion is reported to the Buddha, he lauds
Dhammadinnā for her wisdom, without the least censure of her
having had such a long exchange with her ex-husband. [94]

The converse can be seen in the _Nandakovāda-sutta_, which reports that the monk Nandaka was unwilling to take his turn teaching the nuns, who according to the commentary had been his wives

in former times. [95] [33] When informed about this, the Buddha calls
Nandaka to his presence and orders him to teach the nuns, whereupon Nandaka goes to the nunnery to fulfil his duty. [96]

The circumstance that in the Pāli account he approaches the
nunnery shows that, from the viewpoint of tradition, this particular incident should be placed at a comparatively early stage
in the teaching career of the Buddha, before a rule was promulgated that monks should not approach nunneries to give teachings. [97] In other words, this particular episode should be read as
reflecting an early stage in the development of Buddhist monasticism.

This much already suffices to paint a picture of the early Buddhist monastic attitude towards family relations that offers no support to the assumption that going forth meant a total severance of
all possible interaction with the members of one's family. [98] Such a
conclusion is in fact not altogether new. Collins in his introduction to Wijayaratna (1990: xvif) points out that the assumption
that a solitary lifestyle was characteristic for an early stage of Indian Buddhist monasticism has been shown by Wijayaratna's research on the Pāli _Vinaya_ (originally published in 1983 in French)
to be merely a myth.

As already noted by several scholars, the very organisation of
early Buddhist monasticism was modelled on a 'republican' form
of government based on the clan chiefdom, _gaṇa_, such as the Vajjīs, [99] and the "importance of kinship ties in the extension of sup

port to Buddhism" in its early phase has been discussed by Chakravarti (1987/1996: 143–145). According to Wilson (1996: 29),


evidence from every category of Indian Buddhist literature
may be found to support the view that the _sangha_ is held together by a variety of pseudofamilial ties. Kinship structures
are reduplicated within the _sangha_ in a variety of ways.


Again, as already noted by Frauwallner (1956: 71), most _Vi_  _naya_ s preserve an explicit stipulation according to which a new
monk who joins the Buddhist monastic community should look
on his preceptor as a "father", who in turn looks on him as a
"son". [100]

In this way several scholars have highlighted various aspects
of the family dimensions of Indian Buddhist monasticism. [34] The
continuing importance of family matters for Buddhist monastics
in modern times has been documented in anthropological studies,
be these on monastics in Sri Lanka or else in the north of India in
Zangskar. [101]

The passages on family matters in the Pāli discourses surveyed
so far come alongside recurrent references to departing from the

In the words of
Cole 2004: 281, the "very effort to leave domesticity was itself domesticized
and remade into a Buddhist family"; cf. also Cole 2006: 301, who points out
that "the monastic space was regularly organized as something like a patriarchal family that employed the language of fathers and sons to structure discipline, identity, and authority in a way that rendered monastic identity not all
that different from those templates constructed within the sphere of the lay
family."
101 Cf., e.g., Gutschow 2006 and Samuels 2010.

home for homelessness and leaving behind one's relatives. [102] The
home that one should leave behind receives a more detailed explanation in a discourse in the _Saṃyutta-nikāya_, according to which
this implies leaving behind desire, lust, and craving. [103] Once again
consulting a Pāli discourse can help to make it clear that the notion of leaving behind one's home and family was not invariably
meant to be taken in the strictly literal sense that one is in principle never allowed to approach the place where one formerly lived.
In line with this indication, those who go forth leave behind family and relatives without this implying that they could never ever
relate to them as monastics.

Perhaps a simile may be useful at this point for the sake of illustration. Let us assume someone has left her job. Having left her
job does not mean she can never again enter her former workplace.
She might enter it again, but she would do so as a client or customer. Having left her job also does not mean she will never again
have any contact with her former colleagues. She may well have
such contacts, even with her former boss. But she will not relate to
her ex-boss as an employee, [35] nor expect to receive a salary. In
fact she might dare tell her former boss things she would not have
dared to say earlier, when she was still an employee.


――――――
102 The standard description of going forth as part of the gradual-path account in

the Pāli discourses (cf., e.g., [[DN2]] at DN I 63,9) indicates that leaving behind
a large or small group of relatives one cuts off hair and beard, dons the yellow robes, and goes forth from the household into homelessness.
103 [[SN22.3]] at SN III 10,8 (which uses the term _oka_ instead of _agāra_ ); for a dis
cussion of different nuances of the notion of leaving behind the home cf. Collins
1982: 167–176. Olivelle 1993: 67 explains, in relation to the concern with
homelessness in ancient Indian recluse circles, that "the value system of the
Vedic world is inverted: wilderness over village, celibacy over marriage, economic inactivity over economic productivity, ritual inactivity over ritual performance, instability over stable residence, inner virtue and experience over
outward observance"; cf. also Ashraf 2013.


Migalaṇḍika (Pār 3)  101


It seems to me that going forth from the household life as
depicted in early Buddhist texts is similar. Those who have left
their family homes may still return to visit, but they do so as
monastics. They may still meet their family members, who may
even go forth together with them, but after having gone forth
they relate to each other from the viewpoint of being themselves monastics.

This suggestion finds support in the examples that Clarke has
examined in his study. Particularly striking are _Vinaya_ narratives
reporting that pregnant women go forth and then, once they have
delivered, do not dare to stay in the same room or even touch
their own baby boy. [104] This runs so much counter to the normative reaction of a mother as to make it clear that, even right after
having given birth, they are shown to see themselves as monastics
first of all. The stories portray them approaching the situation of
having a child from within the prescribed code of conduct of a
nun vis-à-vis a male.

What about the solitary lifestyle depicted in the _Khaggavi_  _sāṇa-sutta_ ? [105] According to the two commentaries on the _Sutta-_
_nipāta_, the _Khaggavisāṇa-sutta_ is a collection of sayings by Paccekabuddhas. [106] The canonical _Apadāna_ and its commentary take
the same position. [107] A similar understanding can be seen in the
_Mahāvastu_, which introduces its version of several stanzas paralleling the _Khaggavisāṇa-sutta_ by indicating that the stanzas
were spoken by different Pratyekabuddhas. [108] Such an under

standing recurs in relation to another parallel stanza found in the
_Divyāvadāna_ . [109]

Given this agreement between texts from the MahāsāṅghikaLokottaravāda, the Mūlasarvāstivāda, and the Theravāda traditions, it seems fair to assume that the attribution of these stanzas
to Paccekabuddhas is comparatively early. [110] [36] From the viewpoint of tradition, then, the _Khaggavisāṇa-sutta_ was apparently
never meant to represent the norm for an ideal Buddhist monasticism. Instead, its purpose was to depict what happens precisely
when there is no Buddhist monasticism. [111] The few who reach

110 Norman 1983b: 106 note 70 comments that the parallel in the _Mahāvastu_

"proves that the attribution predates the schism between the Theravadins and
the Mahasanghikas." Salomon 2000: 8f points out that "various Buddhist traditions surrounding the Rhinoceros Sūtra are unanimous, where they say anything about the matter at all, in describing its verses as the inspired utterances
( _gāthā_ or _udāna_ ) of the pratyeka-buddhas." Yet, "some doubt exists on the
part of modern scholars as to whether this association is historically original
to the text or, rather, is a later interpretive imposition". However, "it is clear
that the association of the Rhinoceros Sūtra with the pratyeka-buddhas had
become widespread, indeed apparently unanimous, at a relatively early period,
as confirmed by its attestation in both the Pali and the Sanskrit tradition."
111 Based on what appears to be an implicit reference to the Buddha in [[SNP54]]

Bronkhorst 1993/2000: 125 argues that "the _Khaggavisāṇa Sutta_ must therefore have been composed after, or at the earliest during the preaching of the
Buddha. How then could it be thought of as being composed by Pratyekabuddhas?" [[SNP54]] appears to refer to [[MN122]] at MN III 110,28, where the
Buddha warns Ānanda against excessive socializing. Needless to say, the
point of the original passage was not that Ānanda should live an entirely
solitary life, which would have left the Buddha without his attendant. [[SNP54]]
might therefore be the result of combining this reference with the refrain _eko_
_care khaggavisāṇakappo_ . Such a presumably later addition does not render
impossible the assumption that the bulk of the discourse depicts a mode of
thought believed to have been pre-Buddhist. The _Apadāna_, Ap 7,1, in fact

awakening on their own during such a period become Paccekabuddhas and, in contrast to a Buddha, do not start a monastic
community of disciples. [112] Thus the solitary lifestyle eulogized in
the _Khaggavisāṇa-sutta_, just as the _Mahāsīhanāda-sutta_ 's depiction of the bodhisattva dwelling in total seclusion from human
contact, [113] does not seem to be meant to depict normative behaviour to be emulated by Buddhist monastics in general.

There has been considerable discussion about whether the
term _khaggavisāṇa_ in the title of the discourse and in the recurrent phrase _eko care khaggavisāṇakappo_ illustrates a solitary lifestyle with the example of a rhinoceros or rather of its horn. [37] As
far as I can see, the evidence points to the comparison being with

explicitly introduces the Buddha as the source of information about the sayings by Paccekabuddhas reflected in the _Khaggavisāṇa-sutta_ . This would be
in line with a general attitude in tradition, reflected, e.g., in the _Bodhisattva_  _bhūmi_, Wogihara 1930: 397,11, and the _Cullaniddesa_, Nidd II 80,1, according
to which the Buddha was able to teach events that took place long ago, based
on his own direct knowledge of the past. A to some extent comparable case
can be seen in the _Mahāpadāna-sutta_ and its parallels, where the present Buddha gives information about past Buddhas as well as about himself; cf. [[DN14]]
at DN II 2,15, Fukita 2003: 34,9, [[DA1]] at T I 1c19, T 2 at T I 150a17, T 3 at T
I 154b9, T 4 at T I 159b11, and [[EA48.4]] at T II 790a27. Here, too, the time
when the story is told being the lifetime of the present Buddha, about whom
detailed information is given, does not render it impossible for events to be
reported by the same speaker that were believed to have taken place in the
far-distant past.
112 In the words of Ashraf 2013: 29, the motif of the Pratyekabuddha "describes

the practice of a _monachos_, solitary monk, in contrast to the cenobite, who
finds his relevance in a community of practitioners". For a critical reply to the
suggestion by Norman 1983b that the term Pratyekabuddha refers to one who
awakens because of an external stimulation, _pratyaya_, instead of standing for
one who lives a solitary life without disciples, _pratyeka_, cf. Anālayo 2010f:
11ff.

114 Taking the imagery to be about the horn would have the support of the com
mentaries; cf. Nidd II 129,13, Pj II 65,10, and also Ap-[[AN133.32]] although
Jones 2014: 174f notes that even the commentarial position is not unequivocal. Hare 1945/1947: 11 note 2 comments that the idea of the single horn of
the Indian rhinoceros would convey its "being contrasted no doubt with the
two horns of other animals". This imagery comes alive in the description of
the Indian rhinoceros by Megasthenes in McCrindle 1877: 59, according to
which "a horn sprouts out from between its eyebrows, and this is not straight,
but curved into the most natural wreaths." Contrary to the commentarial explanation, however, according to Edgerton 1953/1998: 202 _s_ . _v_ . _khaḍga-viṣāṇa_,
the term "means _rhinoceros_, = Skt. khaḍgin, originally _having a sword_ (-like)
_horn_ . The comparison is to the animal, not to its horn"; cf. also Bautze 1985:
414. Yet, Norman 1996/2001: 38 points out that in the Jain _Kalpa-sūtra_ the
comparison is to the horn of a rhinoceros. In reply, Salomon 2000: 11 comments that "when we look further afield, in the Buddhist Sanskrit tradition,
the answer seems to be exactly the opposite", that is, there is considerable
support for the image being concerned with the rhinoceros itself. In addition
to this, as noted already by Jayawickrama 1949/1977: 22, "in other places in
the Pāli Canon the idea of wandering alone is compared with the movements
of animals of solitary habits rather than with parts of their anatomy", for which
he provides several examples. To this Salomon 2000: 12 adds that a stanza in
the Gāndhārī parallel to the _Khaggavisāṇa-sutta_ speaks instead of a solitary
elephant, where "the reference can only be to the solitary habits of the bull
elephant." Regarding animal habits, Saddhatissa 1985: 8 note 1 refers to the
"gregarious nature of the Indian species, called _Rhinoceros unicornis_ ", in
support of the interpretation that opts for the horn; cf. also Allen 1959: 77.
But, as pointed out by Jamison 1998: 253, based on quoting authorities on
zoology, the rhinoceros is indeed a solitary animal; thus "the root _car_ 'wander'
is particularly appropriate to the seasonal behavior of the rhinoceros, who
seems almost to conduct himself like a roaming mendicant." Schmithausen
1999: 233 note 13 points out that in the _Khaggavisāṇa-sutta_ the image serves
to illustrate the activity of _carati_, which would support an interpretation of it
as referring to a rhinoceros; cf. also Wright 2001: 4, who notes that "the verb
_care_ shows that the idea of solitary perambulation is paramount." That the


Migalaṇḍika (Pār 3)  105


foregoing discussion would have made it clear that there is no
need to try to dehorn the rhinoceros, since neither the horn nor the
whole animal poses a problem.

In order to correct the mistaken notion that a solitary lifestyle
of the type depicted in the _Khaggavisāṇa-sutta_ was normative for
Indian Buddhist monasticism, the potential of reading the Pāli
discourses could be put to the test again. [38] A standard phrase
found repeatedly at the outset of a Pāli discourse shows the Buddha in the company of five hundred monks. [115] Whereas the number is of course stereotypical, there can be little doubt that it portrays a substantial group of monks living and travelling together
with the Buddha.

A discourse in the _Aṅguttara-nikāya_ even goes so far as to
report that the Buddha stopped one of his monks from going off
into seclusion, recommending that he should stay with the community of monks. [116] This much already suffices to show, again, that
recourse to the Pāli discourses themselves can help to rectify the
notion that monastics are invariably expected to live a solitary life.


――――――

image is indeed about a solitary habit finds further support in the observation
by Caillat 2003: 38 that, judging from Jain texts, it seems preferable "to retain
the full meaning of the substantive _kappa, kalpa_, 'usage, practice' … thus, for
_khaḍga-viṣāṇa-kalpa_, 'following the habits of the rhinoceros'" (in contrast to
the commentarial understanding, which takes _kappa_ to stand for _sadisa_, "like").
Although the situation may have seemed ambivalent by the time of Jones 1949/
1973: 250 note 1 and even Kloppenborg 1974: 60, who takes both interpretations as being valid, to my mind by now the contributions that have been made
by various scholars render the situation fairly conclusive, in that the original
idea would have been to illustrate a solitary lifestyle with the habits of a rhinoceros, the idea of the single horn gaining prominence as a secondary development.

**Reading** _**Vinaya**_ **Material**

The relevance of reading Pāli discourse literature alongside
_Vinaya_ material for exploring topics like family matters can be
seen with another discourse in the _Aṅguttara-nikāya_ . The discourse reports that a mother and her son had both gone forth and
were spending the rainy-season retreat together, visiting each
other often. Eventually they engaged in sexual intercourse with
each other. [117] This story not only shows that it was in principle
possible for mother and son to go forth together, but also for them
to meet regularly and this evidently in rather private circumstances.
A problem arises only once this leads to sex, aggravated in the
present instance by being incest.

The incest story in the _Aṅguttara-nikāya_ clearly shows that
discourse literature can contain material that is rather compromising. The same holds for the mass suicide of monks, where a narrative with considerable potential to be damaging to the reputation of the Buddha as a teacher is not confined to the _Vinaya_ s. [118]
Here the discourse material is as revealing as the _Vinaya_ texts,
both reporting that a recommendation given by the Buddha on a
meditation topic led to a mass suicide among his disciples. [119] [39]

――――――
117 [[AN5.55]] at AN III 67,24; cf. also the discussion in Silk 2008/2009: 126–128.
118 Even for it to be recorded in the _Vinaya_ is remarkable. Mills 1992: 74 com
ments that "it is strange that a story like this, which does no credit to the Buddha, but quite the opposite, was permitted to remain in the Vinaya … if the
story is partly true, it would hardly reflect well on the Buddha, while if the
whole story is true he appears in a worse light still."
119 The tale of the mass suicide is also of interest in relation to the proposition in

Clarke 2014: 17 that "whereas _sūtra_ s go into lengthy discourses on the value
of meditation, for instance, Schopen has shown that Buddhist monastic law
codes warn against rigorous engagement in contemplative exercises" (reference is to Schopen 2004: 26). In the present case the dangers of improper
meditation practice are indeed highlighted, but this occurs together with a
drawing of attention to the advantages of proper practice of mindfulness of


Migalaṇḍika (Pār 3)  107


A case of incest among Buddhist monastics is similarly problematic. Both tales should be found only in "in-house" literature, if a
clear dividing line between material for public display and inhouse documentation had indeed been a concern informing the
formation of the Buddhist textual collections. This is not the case.

The evidently complementary nature of discourse and _Vinaya_
material makes it in my view indispensable that a proper appreciation of individual tales (like the mass suicide of monks) or
Indian Buddhist monasticism in general is based on reading _Vi_ _naya_ stories in conjunction with what early discourse material has
to offer. In contrast, relying only on _Vinaya_ texts would be like
trying to reconstruct the history of a particular country or time
period solely based on criminal records. It does not need much
imagination to envision a rather distorted picture emerging from
using solely such material.

_Vinaya_ tales have their origin in something that went wrong.
They need to be contextualized. Using only _Vinaya_ texts to reconstruct the history of Indian monasticism would be even worse
than relying only on criminal records, since such records can be
expected to be based on actual events. In contrast, _Vinaya_ narratives feature misbehaving monastics side by side with celestial
beings, demons, and animals able to speak. Such narratives tell us
a lot about the views and beliefs held by those responsible for

breathing. Here the dangers and advantages of meditation practice are taken
up both in discourse and in _Vinaya_ literature. In the case of the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_, just to give one other example, Hu-von Hinüber 2014: 89 notes
that instructions on examining the anatomical parts of the body occur as part
of "a long passage about different matters concerning the meditation" on _aśubha_,
in what she considers an attempt "to impart all of the basic knowledge [of]
what a monk needs to practice his daily life in the Saṃgha". Here the purpose
is clearly to encourage meditation – precisely the meditation that the tale of
the mass suicide of monks shows to be problematic – not to warn against it.

are used as a basis for reconstructing the actual situation on the

_Vinaya_ passages referring to nuns running brothels, for example, need not invariably be reflecting actual conditions. In view of
the general Indian perception of renunciant women as being on a
par with prostitutes, [120] [40] it is in principle possible that the idea of
nuns running brothels could have arisen in an environment antagonistic to Buddhist monastics. [121] Once having become a popular perception, this could then have motivated the drawing up of
rules to safeguard reputation, even without it needing to have
actually happened. [122]

This is of course not to say that it is in principle impossible for
something like this to have taken place, but only to point out that
the implications of the existence of such a rule require evaluation.
A decisive criterion when evaluating such stories is to my mind a
principle espoused by Clarke (2014: 166), according to which all
of the extant _Vinaya_ s need to be consulted. In his own words:


――――――
120 Olivelle 2004: 499 notes that in the _Manusmṛti_ "there are women of certain

groups … who are stereotyped as being sexually promiscuous", one of them
being "female wandering ascetics". Similarly, a commentary on the _Manu_  _smṛti_, quoted in Jyväsjärvi 2007: 80, defines females who have become homeless as "women without protectors … [who], being lustful women, are disguised in the dress (of ascetics)."
121 The suggestion in Clarke 2014: 35 that the occurrence of certain narrative

motifs in Sanskrit drama and other Indian literature antagonistic to Buddhism
can serve to corroborate that descriptions of misbehaviour in _Vinaya_ narratives are based on historical facts is not conclusive and such parallelism is
open to quite different interpretations.
122 Horner 1938/1982: xxi notes that _Vinaya_ narratives at times give the impres
sion "that these are the outcome, not of events, so much as of lengthy and
anxious deliberations. The recensionists had a responsible task. They were
legislating for the future."


Migalaṇḍika (Pār 3)  109


any _vinaya_ cannot be accepted as representative of Indian
Buddhist monasticisms without first fully examining the other
five monastic law codes; we must marshal all available evidence in rereading Indian Buddhist monasticisms.


Given that references to nuns running brothels do not seem to
appear in all _Vinaya_ s, [123] the possibility that these references have
come into being as the product of imagination has to be seriously
taken into consideration. Had this been a real problem during the
early stages of Indian Buddhist monasticism, [41] we would expect
all of the _Vinaya_ s to try to tackle it.

Regarding Indian Buddhist monasticism in general, based on his
study of family matters in _Vinaya_ literature Clarke (2014: 155)
comes to the conclusion that "mainstream Buddhism itself is starting to look surprisingly and increasingly like what we see in later
Mahāyāna Buddhism in Nepal, for instance." In my view this is not
an accurate reflection of the material he has studied, as it does not
take into full consideration the difference between monastics who
relate to their former partners as monastics and priests who actually
live a family life. Moreover, it fails to distinguish between what the
texts present as exceptional and what as common behaviour. [124]

123 [124] Judging from the survey in Clarke 2014: 228 note 63, the brothel motif is

only found in some _Vinaya_ [[SN124]] [125] In relation to the discussion by Clarke 2014: 47–56 of the tales of Dhar
madinnā and Sudinna as evidence for monastics living with their families,
Ohnuma 2014: 2 queries, in relation to Sudinna, "shouldn't his behavior be
seen as a precedent-setting example of everything that a monastic should _not_
do, and thereby as a highly unusual case?" Thus "making _some_ distinction – no
matter how speculative – between those familial practices that were truly ordinary and those that were highly unusual" seems to be required. Besides,
"Clarke also fails to consider the _negative_ evidence: If the practice of monastics living at home were anything other than highly unusual, wouldn't the _vi_  _naya_ s contain legal procedures for how to deal with such monastics and leg

The cases Clarke has surveyed in his study all fall under the
first category of monastics relating to their former partners as
monastics. When those who go forth need not obtain a legal divorce, in keeping with ancient Indian customs, then this does not
imply that their marriage will not be considered on a practical
level as having come to an end. Once former husband and wife
relate to each other as monastics and are no longer permitted to
have sex with each other, this does amount to a substantial difference from the married priests of Newar Buddhism in Nepal. [125] In

islate their proper roles within the monastic community? And if such rules
are lacking, shouldn't we conclude that the cases of Sudinna and Dharmadinnā were, in fact, fairly unusual and lacked the taken-for-granted quality of
occasional visits home?" Regarding the story of Dharmadinnā found in the
Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ 's account of ordination by messenger (on which see
also Yao 2015b), it seems to me that Clarke's presentation is beset by the same
methodological problem as his reasoning regarding the nature of _pārājika_
rules (cf. above p. 19ff), where he also bases far-reaching conclusions on a
story found only in the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ . In the present case the accounts of ordination by messenger in the parallel versions, listed in Clarke
2014: 190 note 37, have completely different narratives. Yet, as formulated
by Clarke 2014: 18 himself, when studying _Vinaya_ narrative we should "ensure that what we see is not just an isolated viewpoint of a single tradition,
but is broadly representative of the canonical jurists' handling … in all extant
_vinaya_ s."
125 [126] Gellner 1989: 6 explains that "the role of part-time Buddhist monk within

the institutional framework of Newar Buddhism is restricted to [the sacerdotal caste of the] Śākyas and Vajrācāryas. The role of the permanent, and permanently celibate, monk or nun is open neither to them nor to any other Newar … the traditional institutions of Newar Buddhism provide for no such
role"; cf. also Gellner 1992: 59: "Vajrācāryas and Śākyas are, then, householder Buddhist monks." Allen 1973: 11 even speaks of "the radical anticelibacy of the form of Buddhism" found in Nepal. As explained by von Rospatt (forthcoming), "though assuming monkhood only ritually for a few days,
they maintain their monastic identity even after disrobing. Thus Newar Buddhism is not a 'Buddhism without monks,' as some observers have held, but a

sum, Clarke's conclusion is an example of a tendency whereby, in
the words of Ohnuma (2014: 3), [42] he "occasionally overstates
his case".

This to my mind corroborates the fact that excessive emphasis
on misdeeds reported in _Vinaya_ texts can lead to painting a distorted picture. The same holds for the mass suicide of monks. The
story does make it unmistakably clear that the early generations of
reciters did not yet conceive of the Buddha as an infallible and
omniscient teacher. At the same time, however, the tale needs to
be considered alongside records of the Buddha's successful teaching activities found elsewhere, that is, it needs to be contextualized. Such contextualization within the whole extant textual corpus by way of a comparative study of all extant versions in order
to discern tendencies of textual development in different reciter
traditions, in combination with taking into account the ancient
Indian setting, enables a proper appreciation of such _Vinaya_ tales.


**Conclusion**

Understanding the tale of the mass suicide of monks requires
taking into account the ascetic environment within which early
Buddhism evolved. The tale itself depicts a recommendation
given by the Buddha being put to use without proper instructions.
The resultant mass suicide reflects the influence of a prevalent
negative attitude towards the body and the tolerance of suicide in
ancient Indian ascetic circles. In a _Vinaya_ teaching context, this

identity as monastics"; cf. also Lienhard 1999 and von Rospatt 2005. I fail to
see how mainstream Indian Buddhist monasticism could be considered as resembling such descriptions. With this I do not in any way intend to encourage
an evaluation of Newar Buddhism as a degeneration, but only to clarify that it
does differ substantially from what available sources allow us to know about
mainstream Indian Buddhist monasticism.

tale would have evolved in line with its function to demarcate
Buddhist monastic identity in contrast to contemporary ascetic
values by showing how things can go wrong.

The occurrence of the mass-suicide tale among the discourses
shows that problematic narratives were not allocated to _Vinaya_
texts only, making it improbable that these offer us the only window available for in-house information on what took place on the
ground. Instead, _Vinaya_ narratives need to be read with a clear
recognition of their teaching purposes and of the fact that they are
naturally concerned with what went wrong, [43] instead of giving
us a complete picture of Indian Buddhist monasticism as a whole.
They reflect views and opinions held by those responsible for the
final shape of the passages in question, which result from a range
of influences, historical events being only one of them.


## **Vessantara (Jā 547)**

**Introduction**

In this chapter I study a tale whose probably best-known version is the _Vessantara-jātaka_ preserved in Pāli. My exploration is
informed by an interest in the genesis of the basic trope and, in
line with a recurrent topic in preceding chapters, its function as a
_Vinaya_ narrative, which it assumes at least in the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition (in the Theravāda tradition, the tale is not found in
the _Vinaya_ ).

I begin my exploration by summarizing a version of the tale
found in the _Saṅghabhedavastu_ of the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_
and then turn to the topic of giving to brahmins as well as to giving as one of the perfections. Next I take up aspects of the story
from the viewpoint of normative Buddhist ethics and from a historical-critical perspective, after which I explore its function as a
_Vinaya_ narrative.


**The** _**Saṅghabhedavastu**_ **Version**

In keeping with a general tendency of the Mūlasarvāstivāda
_Vinaya_ to abound in stories, the _Saṅghabhedavastu_ contains several tales that report past lives of Devadatta. These serve to provide a background to his activities at the Buddha's time. Besides
attempts at assassinating the Buddha and creating a schism, according to this _Vinaya_ he also killed an arahant nun. [1] From the

viewpoint of Mūlasarvāstivada _Vinaya_ reciters, [2] [12] he thus committed three of the five severe crimes which bring immediate retribution ( _ānantarya_ ). [3] The _Saṅghabhedavastu_ reports that, on being
informed that Devadatta had beaten an arahant nun to death, the
Buddha delivered a story of a former life of Devadatta as an animal in which he acted similarly. This tale serves to show that
Devadatta had a deep-seated tendency towards performing wicked
deeds from his past lives and also explains why a relative of the
Buddha, who even goes forth as a monk, could still go so far as to
perform such evils.

The same pattern of portraying Devadatta as an evil character
throughout many of his former lives leads the _Saṅghabhedavastu_
to present its version of the tale of the prince Viśvantara, a former
life of the Buddha. At the conclusion of the tale, the Buddha informs the listening monks that a merciless brahmin, who had brazenly asked for the children of Viśvantara, was a former life of
Devadatta. The main story proceeds as follows:

Brahmins from a rival country ask the prince for the royal elephant, and he gives it to them. For this action he is exiled from his
country; his wife Mādrī and his two children follow him. On his way
into exile, a brahmin asks for his chariot, and this too he gives away.

When the family has settled down in a hermitage and Mādrī is
absent gathering fruit, a brahmin asks for the two children to become his servants; the prince gives them to him. Indra/Śakra transforms himself into a brahmin and asks the prince for his wife Mādrī;
her too he gives away. Indra/Śakra discloses his identity and returns Mādrī, admonishing the prince not to give her away again.
The brahmin in the meantime tries to sell the children at the mar――――――

ket in town. They are ransomed by the king, who then recalls the
prince and Mādrī from exile.

This sketch of the main elements in the _Saṅghabhedavastu_
equally well summarizes a tale found in the eleventh-century
_Kathāsaritsāgara_ by the Śaivite Somadeva. The resemblance is
so close that, even though the name of the prince differs (which it
also does in various Buddhist tellings of the story), [4] the name of
his faithful spouse Mādrī remains the same. [5] [13]

The _Kathāsaritsāgara_ shows that the tale summarized above
can function meaningfully outside a Buddhist context. It follows
that the identifications of the prince with the Buddha and the brahmin with Devadatta, found in several Buddhist versions of the
story, [6] are not indispensable elements in the narrative.

By implication the same holds for the idea that the various
gifts made to brahmins are part of the pre-awakening path of cultivation required for reaching Buddhahood. Although this is a
prominent element in Buddhist tellings, so much so that in one
_jātaka_ extant in Chinese translation the prince even proclaims that
he aspires to the path of the Mahāyāna, [7] in the _Kathāsaritsāgara_
the prince just explains that his giving is motivated by his desire
to give to brahmins. [8]

**Giving to Brahmins**

The important role of brahmins as recipients of gifts not only
emerges from the _Kathāsaritsāgara_, but can also be seen in the
_Saṅghabhedavastu_ version. Here the brahmin, on being congratulated by others on the wealth he has acquired by selling the children of the prince, affirms that this is his due, since being from
the highest caste he is worthy of offerings. [9] This places the dramatic story of the gift of the children within the framework of the
role of brahmins in ancient Indian society as worthy recipients of
gifts, whose requests have to be met in order to avoid causing any
offence. The need to avoid offending brahmins also finds explicit
mention in the _Saṅghabhedavastu_ version, where, in the episode
that involves giving away the chariot, the prince tells his wife that
one should never disparage a brahmin. [10] [14]

Jamison (1996: 164) reports that


the figure of the Exploited Host, who patiently and unquestioningly accedes to increasingly onerous and often humiliating
demands, is almost a stock character in the Mahābhārata … there
are several similar stories in the Mahābhārata about … imperious and capricious visiting Brahmans who take over their host's
households and even their lives.


According to Jamison (1996: 168f),


the host's duty of unfailing generosity to a visitor is not
limited to the usual food and other accoutrements, but extends

to the ceding of control over the persons of the hosting family … [such stories demonstrate] the value attached to yielding
without complaint to any demand … no matter how bizarre or
painful … [providing] an incentive to practice unquestioning
hospitality … as no doubt the Visiting Brahman lobby was
well aware.


The notion that the requests of begging brahmins have to be
met at all costs comes up also in the prologue to the _Pārāyana-_
_vagga_ . Having just completed a great sacrifice, Bāvari is unable
to give to a visiting brahmin the sum of money the latter requests.
The visiting brahmin threatens that after seven days Bāvari's head
will split into seven pieces for having failed to satisfy his request. [11]

In the _Pārāyana-vagga_ the claim by the begging brahmin is
dismissed as deluded, exemplifying the early Buddhist attitude to
the trope of the supposed duties of a host towards a visiting brahmin's unreasonable requests and the alleged dangers incurred by
upsetting a brahmin.

The commentary to the _Pārāyana-vagga_ reports that the begging brahmin had been sent on his mission by his young wife, who
wanted him to get money from Bāvari and then buy a household
servant who would relieve her of the housework. [12] Similarly, in
the _Vessantara-jātaka_ the brahmin who begs for the children has
been sent by his young wife, who wants to have the children as
household servants to relieve her of the housework, in particular
of having to fetch water. [13] This similarity in the narrative background of these two instances reflects the same basic tendency to

ironical exaggeration by depicting a brahmin whose unreasonable
demands are motivated by the wish to please his young wife. The
portrayal of this brahmin in the _Vessantara-jātaka_ in fact brims
with a tendency to caricature. [15]

In contrast to this basic similarity in narrative mode and detail,
the prologue to the _Pārāyana-vagga_ and the _Vessantara-jātaka_
exhibit a substantially different attitude towards the trope of having to oblige the demands of a begging brahmin. Here outright
dismissal in the _Pārāyana-vagga_ stands out against wholehearted
compliance in the _Vessantara-jātaka_ . This conveys the impression that the basic trope in the _Vessantara-jātaka_ is perhaps more
at home in the _Mahābhārata_ than in Buddhist discourse.

The spotlight on having to oblige begging brahmins is a general feature of the tale in various other versions, where those
who ask the prince for his possessions and family members are
invariably actual brahmins (or Śakra/Sakka disguised as a brahmin). Brahmins are even explicitly mentioned in rather brief references to the story. This holds for a _pūrvayoga_ extant in a Gāndhārī fragment, which notes that the gift of the elephant was
made to a brahmin. [14] Similarly brief references in the Khotanese
_Jātakastava_ and the * _Mahāprajñāpāramitopadeśa_ report that
the prince gave his children to a brahmin. [15] That the elephant
and the children were given away to brahmins also finds explicit
expression in the description by the pilgrim Xuánzàng (玄奘) of
his visit to the location where these events were believed to have
taken place. [16]

The same can also be seen from a representation of the gift of
the elephant from Goli in Andhra Pradesh, which shows the prince
ceremoniously pouring out water when giving the elephant to brahmins, recognizable as such by the pots they carry (the two behind
the one who receives the elephant on their behalf also carry sticks,
another signifier of brahmin identity in pictorial representation). [17]

In a _jātaka_ collection extant in Chinese translation the children
tell their father that, in spite of their youth, they have already heard
that according to the Dharma of brahmins one should protect one's
wife and children in order to be reborn in the Brahmā world. [18] This
implies that for the prince to give away his children (and later his
wife) to a brahmin is not in keeping with the very Dharma of
brahmins. In fact the children qualify the one to whom they are
being given as an "evil brahmin". [19] [16/17]

The _Vessantara-jātaka_, Āryaśūra's _Jātakamālā_, and _jātaka_
collections extant in Chinese translation go a step further. They
report that one of the children tried to prevent their being given
away by telling their father that the one who had asked for them
was not a real brahmin, but an evil spirit. [20]

Clearly the motif of having to give to begging brahmins whatever they demand is a central aspect of the various tellings of the
story and explains the denouement of the main plot. [21] Needless to
say, brahmins are of course a recurrent feature in the wider _jātaka_
and _apadāna_ genre, so that their occurrence as such in the present
tale is not in itself surprising. What is unusual, however, is the
type of gifts they request and receive in the _Vessantara-jātaka_
and its parallels.


**The Perfection of Giving**

Whereas from the viewpoint of the need to fulfil one's obligation towards begging brahmins the basic story is well in line with
other such tales in the _Mahābhārata_, as a _jātaka_ the same narrative is extraordinary. As Shaw (2015: 513) points out, "in no other
_jātaka_ does the Bodhisatta make such gifts, encourage others to
do so, or speak to his children in this way." Here it needs to be
kept in mind that the trope of giving away part of one's body or
the whole body differs, since making such offerings requires directly inflicting harm only on oneself, not on others. The challenge to understand and appreciate the gifts made by the bodhisattva in the _Vessantara-jātaka_ is in fact a continuous theme in
the Buddhist traditions, which can best be explored by taking up
the Pāli version and its reception.

Already the _Vessantara-jātaka_ itself voices criticism of the
prince’s generosity. After the gift of the elephant, the citizens
point out that it would have been proper for Vessantara to give

already been noted by Gombrich 1985: 436 and the pervasiveness of this
motif in the various versions by Durt 2000: 137.

food, [18] drink, clothes, and dwelling places to brahmins, [22] but not
the royal elephant. When the prince gives away his children, the
son asks his father if his heart is made of stone. [23] When hearing of
the gift of the children, the courtiers express their criticism ( _gara_ _ha_ ), in that it is wrong for Vessantara to act like this; he can give
away slaves, animals, or a chariot, but not his own children. [24]

A critical attitude finds expression again in the _Milindapañha_ .
Putting the dilemma in succinct terms, the question is: "If one gives
a gift that inflicts suffering on others, does that gift result in happiness and lead to heaven?" [25] The allusion to rebirth in heaven reflects the position taken in the Pāli tradition that Vessantara was
reborn in the Tusita realm, from where he then took birth on earth as
Gotama and became a Buddha.

The dilemma spotted by King Milinda in the _Milindapañha_
concerns basic ethical norms of early Buddhist thought. The point
he makes is that, granted that Vessantara wishes to gain merit, he
could have given himself as a gift, instead of inflicting harm on
others by giving them away. [26] The problem is that, whereas Vessantara has the right to do with his own body whatever he wishes,
the authority he has as a father over his children and as a husband
over his wife comes together with the responsibility to take care

of them properly and protect them. [27] At least from the viewpoint
of early Buddhist ethics, he is not free to give them away in a
manner that clearly involves harming them.

Given this conflict with basic ethical principles, it is no surprise that misgivings continue to be voiced by modern-day Theravādins. [28] Gombrich (1971/2008: 312) comments on Vessantara's giving away of his wife and children that this not only


strikes us as excessive. It strikes the Sinhalese in the same

by making another suffer? Will any one of you in this audience give away your
own wife to another just so that you could gain merit for yourself?"

keep the morality of husbands": far from protecting his wife …
he lets her slip into poverty and even gives her away to another man "as if she were not a human being". Vessantara is a
"father who fails to keep the morality of fathers": he does not
protect his children … he accepts seeing them beaten in front
of him.


Ladwig (2016: 63) reports from Laos the comment on Vessantara that,


the more he gives away, the more problematic and egoistic his generosity becomes. His drive for giving becomes a
burden for other people and it produces considerable suffering. His excessive generosity is almost comparable to a kind
of illness.


The contrast between the doctrinal framework of the perfections to be cultivated by a bodhisattva and the storyline of the
Vessantara tale becomes further accentuated by the circumstance
that the Theravāda tradition reckons this particular life to be the
last in the series of human existences of the Buddha-to-be. This
positioning implies that, by the time of this life, the bodhisattva
must have already reached a high level in his cultivation of the
perfections.

The Theravāda list of the perfections includes _mettā_ as well as
truthfulness, alongside giving. Yet it is not easy to conceive of
Vessantara's acts as springing from the mind of one who has already perfected _mettā_ and truthfulness. The problem is not merely
the giving away of his innocent and crying children to a cruel brahmin who mistreats them in front of his eyes. According to the Pāli
report, when confronted with his distraught wife, who worries
about what has happened to the children, Vessantara at first just
remains silent for quite some time, and when he finally speaks to
her he is portrayed as intentionally using "harsh speech" to make


124  _Vinaya_ Studies


her give up her sorrow. [30] [20] Not only does he employ harsh speech
on this occasion, but earlier Vessantara is on record as intentionally "deceiving" her. [31] Such a depiction of his behaviour would be
surprising if the story had originally been conceived as an illustration of a past life of the Buddha-to-be so close to his final lifetime
that he had already accomplished the perfections of _mettā_ and
truthfulness to a high degree.

The commentary on the _Cariyāpiṭaka_ (the root text of which
also has a version of Vessantara's deeds) proclaims that all perfections without exception have as their characteristic the benefitting
of others, and as their proximate cause compassion and skilful
means. [32] Vessantara's generosity, however, seems to be carried
out to benefit himself first of all, and any benefit to others would
only result from his eventual attainment of Buddhahood in a future life. Compassion and the exercise of skilful means are certainly not conspicuous aspects of his conduct. In sum, the perfections to be cultivated by a bodhisattva do not seem to be the natural home for the arising of the story of Vessantara. If the original
idea had been to portray the perfection of giving at its utmost extremes, this could still have been done without doing violence to
the cultivation of the other perfections.

According to the _Lakkhaṇa-sutta_, the bodhisattva's exercise of
truthfulness in previous lives formed the condition for his gain of

two of the thirty-two bodily marks with which as a Buddha he
was endowed. [33] Another deed leading to his endowment with another of the thirty-two marks was that in previous lives he kept
reuniting families, uniting mother with child and child with mother,
etc. [34] Such descriptions do not sit too well with the Vessantara
tale as a depiction of the Buddha's penultimate life as a human
being.

Now the _Vessantara-jātaka_ is at the same time "the last, longest, and most famous of the Pāli collection of Jātaka stories", as
noted by Norman (1981/1991: 172). Two of the three aspects
mentioned are closely interrelated, [21] since the Pāli _Jātaka_ collection proceeds from short to long _jātaka_ s, wherefore the _Ves_ _santara-jātaka_ as the longest is inevitably also its last and therefore the final member of its ultimate group of tales, the _Mahāni_ _pāta_ .

According to Appleton (2010: 73f), whereas


the position of the _Vessantara-jātaka_ … is related merely
to the number of the verses contained within it … ideas of
chronology and biography were introduced to the collection
later, after the order of the stories was fixed. If, therefore, the
popularity of the _Vessantara-jātaka_ is due to its status as the
antepenultimate birth of the Buddha, and this in turn is due to
a purely mnemonic ordering, then an inability to explain in
what way the story embodies the highest achievements of the
Bodhisatta is unsurprising.


Appleton and Shaw (2015: 3f) explain that

_rā samānetā ahosi_ .


126  _Vinaya_ Studies


the idea that _jātaka_ stories illustrate the long path to Buddhahood is not found in the earliest layers of the text … [thus]
the association between _jātaka_ stories and the perfections came
relatively late in the compositional history of the _Jātakattha_  _vaṇṇanā_ .


Appleton (2010: 147 and 149) points out that, although


_jātaka_ s were not originally conceived of as demonstrating
the gradual perfection of the Bodhisatta … the framing as Bodhisatta-biography and Buddha- _dhamma_ make the story more
able to communicate Buddhist ideals such as the perfections,
even where the central message of the story itself seems to be
of little importance.


Thus it seems fair to conclude that the Vessantara tale quite
probably shares with many other members of the _jātaka_ collection
that it is a final product of an integration of various fables, anecdotes, and parables, taken from the ancient Indian repertoire and
incorporated into Buddhist narrative lore. [35] Its popularity may at
least to some degree be the outcome of the fruitful tension that
arises between the denouement of the story and Buddhist ideals. [22]

35 Cf., e.g., von Hinüber 1998: 190–192 and Anālayo 2010d: 55–71. Appleton

and Shaw 2015: 28 explain that "the _jātaka_ s are the product of a broader Indian narrative scene, and the _Mahānipāta_ stories [of which _Vessantara_ is the
last] in particular appear to have a strong relationship with Indian epic sources";
on this topic cf. also Lüders 1897/1940 and 1904/1940 as well as Gombrich
1985. That the same pattern applies to the present case has already been suggested by Fick 1926: 147, who comments that "wir haben es bei der …Vessantara-Legende zweifellos mit einem gemeinindischen, im Volke weitverbreiteten und beliebten Stoff zu turn, der von Brahmanen wie von Buddhisten
und Jainisten für ihre religiösen Zwecke verwertet, dichterisch weiterverarbeitet und mit Zügen ausgestattet wurde, die der Bearbeiter zum Teil aus
anderen Sagenkreisen entlehnte."


Vessantara (Jā 547)  127


Another argument supporting the impression that the Vessantara tale did not originate in a Buddhist ideological frame has been
presented by Alsdorf (1957: 61), who points out the prominent
role of indulging in intoxicating drink in several episodes of the
tale. The royal palace is described as a place where one is woken
up with meat and liquor. [36] When Vessantara departs for his exile,
he has strong drink distributed on his behalf. [37] When he returns
home, each village along the way is to prepare a hundred jars with
liquor for distribution. [38] Such recurrent celebration of the consumption of alcohol confirms that several aspects of the tale did
not originate in a setting imbued with Buddhist ethical values.


**The 'Buddhist' Nature of the** _**Vessantara-jātaka**_

Based on his detailed study, Alsdorf (1957: 70) then comes to
the conclusion that the _Vessantara-jātaka_ "is just as completely
un-Buddhist or rather pre-Buddhist as the vast majority of the
other Jātakas". This has been criticized by Collins (2016: 4), who
sees this conclusion


as a kind of cartoon sketch of an outmoded Orientalism: the
natives, in their blindness, have all-unknowingly preserved as
their favorite Buddhist text something that in fact, as revealed
by the dogged philological labors of the rationalist Herr Professor in his European library, has in itself nothing to do with them.


Although the formulation employed by Alsdorf is indeed too
strong, [39] when considered in context it becomes clear that his state

128  _Vinaya_ Studies


ment is in reply to the suggestion by Winternitz that the _Vessan_ _tara-jātaka_ 's "purely Buddhistic origin is unmistakeable", a quote
with which Alsdorf introduces his assessment. Leaving aside the
exaggerated expression "completely un-Buddhist", however, and
without in any way wanting to advocate a return to Orientalism,
the qualification of the basic storyline as not originally Buddhist
seems to me to offer a meaningful perspective for understanding
the evolution of the tale. In other words, I suggest making a distinction between the tale becoming 'Buddhist' as a result of its
cultural history and the question of the historical genesis of its
basic trope. If we want to give a fair hearing to tradition, alongside the popularity of the _Vessantara-jātaka_ the various instances
of criticism, surveyed above, need to be taken seriously as reflecting a continuous sense of unease with central elements of the tale. [23]

Collins (2016: 4f) mentions the example of the "Buddhist virtue of _mettā_ " to argue that


obviously the values of friendliness, kindness, beneficence,
etc., can be found in any and every cultural context, both before and outside of Buddhist texts. So when a Buddhist acts in
a kind, friendly manner toward a fellow human being, is he or
she then being "completely un-Buddhist or rather pre-Buddhist"?


Now the Pāli discourses and their parallels do present _mettā_ as
something that had been practised long before the advent of the
Buddha. A case in point is the tale of Sunetta, a seer of ancient
times who cultivated _mettā_ with sufficient success to be reborn in
the Brahmā world.

The same tale is also of interest to the topic of the evolution of
_jātaka_ s in general, inasmuch as the relevant discourse in the _Aṅ_ ――――――

2000: 201 opts for the preferable expression "originally non-Buddhist". Alsdorf 1977: 25 again employs the expression "un-Buddhist", but without the
qualification "completely", in a discussion of Jā 543.


Vessantara (Jā 547)  129


_guttara-nikāya_ does not identify Sunetta as a past life of the Buddha; an identification found in a _Madhyama-āgama_ parallel. [40] This
is one of several examples illustrating the same basic pattern, also
evident in the Vessantara tale, of stories being not necessarily
conceived of from the outset as former existences of the Buddha.

Whether or not Sunetta is explicitly identified as a past life of
the Buddha, this tale does imply that tradition itself considered
_mettā_ to be "pre-Buddhist" in the sense that it was already known
and practised before Gotama Buddha started to teach. Such recognition even takes the form of pointing out in what way the
practice of _mettā_ taught by Gotama Buddha differs from the cultivation of _mettā_ by his contemporaries. [41] The decisive difference
is found in yoking _mettā_ to the arousing of the awakening factors,
thereby putting it to the service of Buddhist soteriology. In this
way the example of _mettā_ illustrates that to conceptualize certain
ideas or practices as "pre-Buddhist" or "not originally Buddhist"
is very much in keeping with a position at times adopted by the
tradition itself. [24]


**The** _**Vessantara-jātaka**_ **in Historical-critical Perspective**

Collins (2016: 5) continues his criticism of Alsdorf by stating that


much more important than the issue of unnecessary identity
language is the fact that the search for an original ur-text,

of Greek and Latin, misunderstands the narrative traditions of
South and Southeast Asia, where a complex mixture and overlap of orality and literacy makes the search for origins quixotic
at best.


I am not sure if we need to dismiss Alsdorf's study as being informed by a quest for the ur-text, or whether it could not rather be
read as offering a historical-critical perspective that prevents mistaking the _Vessantara-jātaka_ for an ur-text. An example is his suggestion that a misplacing in sequence of a verse seems to have led
to the impression that, after the horses had been given away to
begging brahmins, the chariot was still being drawn by draught
animals. This then would have led to the arising of a prose narration according to which _deva_ s intervened, taking the form of deer
to draw the chariot. [42] The suggestion by Alsdorf seems to offer a
reasonable hypothesis and has been accepted as such, for example, by Cone and Gombrich (1977: xxxii), who comment that


this explanation appears to us convincing. The supernatural
incident generated by a chance misunderstanding appealed to
contemporary sentiment, and became embedded in the tradition.


The prose description resulting from this apparent error could
then in turn have influenced Āryaśūra's _Jātakamālā_, which has a
similar episode. [43]

this story in the oral and eventually in the written medium, it is
still possible to discern in a broad manner stages of development, such as to propose that a mix-up in the sequence of the
canonical verses could have led to a particular prose description
in the _Jātaka_ commentary. [44] The type of historical perspective
that emerges in this way shows that the _Vessantara-jātaka_ is the
product of a gradual evolution. [25] In its present form the Pāli
prose, and by implication also Āryaśūra's _Jātakamālā_, shows the
incorporation of a later element. Versions that do not have the
intervention by _deva_ s to pull the chariot stand a good chance of
having preserved an earlier version of the account of the prince’s
journey into exile.

This is helpful in so far as it counters a tendency, sometimes
found even in contemporary scholarship, to conceive the Pāli version of a particular text as invariably the most original version at


――――――
44 Collins 2016: 11f also comments that it seems to him that " _jātaka_ stories were

originally in prose and verse combined (in Sanskrit called the _campū_ style),
which the later tradition has bifurcated into canonical verses and prose commentary." A close study of the _Udāna_ collection as another text in the same
_Khuddaka-nikāya_ shows the existence of a versified nucleus accompanied by
a more fluctuating prose, which due to its later date of completion only became part of the canonical collection in some reciter traditions; cf. Anālayo
2009b. Such a pattern, where a more fixed base text is accompanied by a commentary more open to variation and change, can also be seen at work in the relationship between the code of rules and the accompanying stories in _Vinaya_
literature; cf. Schlingloff 1963. The same emerges from a comparative study
of the early discourses; cf. Anālayo 2010e. In fact the same can even be discerned in the early stage of evolution of the Abhidharma; cf. Anālayo 2014c:
79–89. This pattern is so pervasive in Buddhist literature as to make it safe to
conclude that the case of the _Jātaka_ collection follows the same model, in that
only the verses are canonical simply because they served as a more fixed base
text whose more variable prose commentary only became fixed at a subsequent time, too late for it to become part of the canonical text.

our disposal. [45] This is in fact what Collins (2016: 6) does to some
degree, when he refers to the _Vessantara-jātaka_ as


the earliest and most prestigious telling we now have. But
that does not make it an ur-text of which other tellings are versions or variants. Better than the chronological language of
original and later versions is a distinction … between 'authoritative' and 'oppositional' tellings. [46]


It is hard for me to see how the _Vessantara-jātaka_ could be
considered the earliest telling we have. [47] There seems to be no _a_
_priori_ reason why the tale summarized above from the _Saṅgha_ _bhedavastu_, for example, or one of the other _jātaka_ versions extant in at times fairly early Chinese translations, might not have
preserved more archaic elements. In fact none of these versions
has the intervention of _deva_ s to pull the horse-less chariot, making it reasonable to assume that, at least in this respect, they offer
an earlier account of the episode of the gift of the horses and/or
the chariot than the Pāli version. [48] [26]


――――――
45 For a more detailed criticism of the assumption that the Pāli version must in
variably be the earliest textual witness at our disposal cf. Anālayo 2016e.
46 Collins 2016: 19–23 offers a detailed survey of translations of different ver
sions of the tale, showing that his assessment of the Pāli version as the earliest
and most authoritative was made in awareness of the extant parallels.
47 Already Lienhard 1978: 139 suggested that the _Vessantara-jātaka_ is the oldest

version we have.
48 The _Saṅghabhedavastu_ reports only a single gift of chariot and horses to
gether; cf. Gnoli 1978a: 123,29, [[DN1]] _nga_ 195a6 or Q 1030 _ce_ 183b8, and T
1450 at T XXIV 182b6 (on versions of this tale in the _Bhaiṣajyavastu_ cf. the
survey in Yao 2012: 1191 §11). In T 152 at T III 9a8 and T 171 at T III 420c15
the prince first gives away the horses and then pulls the chariot himself, before
giving away the chariot as well. T 153 at T III 59b15 does not report that the
prince departed into exile on a chariot drawn by horses, so that here the whole
episode of giving these away is not found.


Vessantara (Jā 547)  133


Nor is the distinction between 'authoritative' and 'oppositional'
tellings necessarily more relevant, since Mūlasarvāstivāda reciters
in India need not even have been aware of the Theravāda _Vessan_ _tara-jātaka_ . Even if they had been aware of it, which is not particularly probable, they would not have considered it as authoritative and quite likely also not as oppositional.

In short, it seems to me that adopting a historical-critical perspective is a useful approach to the study of a particular tale, enabling us to explore the probable framework of conditions that
would have influenced the coming into being of the text in its present form. [49] The wish to avoid the quest for an ur-text need not lead
us to the opposite stance of disregarding that there have been preversions to the text we have in hand. Such an opposite stance can
easily lead to ignoring historical layers in the development of a particular text, thereby potentially also ignoring the multiplicity of
conditions, cross-fertilizations, and other dynamics that have influenced the oral transmission of what we now access in the form
of a written testimony of a particular instance of this complex
process. Once the indeed unwarranted valorisation of anything
early as intrinsically superior to later 'degenerations' has been left
behind, the historical dimension as such offers an important tool
for contextualization that should not be too easily dismissed. [50]

On this basis and without thereby in any way intending to turn
a blind eye to the complexity of the range of conditions that would
have influenced the genesis of the tale in its various manifestations, I propose the conclusion that the tale summarized at the beginning of this chapter quite probably originated in dialogue with

the importance of unfaltering hospitality to brahmins. Its present
form in the Buddhist traditions does appear to some degree to be
comparable to the case of _mettā_, [27] in that a practice or story has
been adopted and imbued with Buddhist values by relating it to
qualities concerned with awakening, be these the awakening
factors in the case of _mettā_ or the perfections in the case of the
_jātaka_ tale.


**The Function of the Tale as a** _**Vinaya**_ **Narrative**

The suggestion that the tale of Viśvantara takes its basic plot
from concern with hospitality to brahmins leads me to the question of its function in the Buddhist traditions. Whereas in the _Saṅ_ _ghabhedavastu_ the story serves to illustrate to the monks the evil
nature of Devadatta, this is not the only context for this story to
manifest in the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ . Another telling can be
found in the _Bhaiṣajyavastu_ of the same _Vinaya_ . [51]

In the _Bhaiṣajyavastu_ the tale is addressed to a king and serves
the function of illustrating the bodhisattva's practice of generosity


――――――
51 Durt 2000: 138 notes a difference between the two Chinese versions, as in T

1448 at T XXIV 66a19 not only the brahmin asking for the prince’s wife, but
also the one who asks for the children is an apparition caused by Śakra. This
creates an internal inconsistency, as later this brahmin brings the children to
the town where they are going to be ransomed by their grandfather, something
he does on being influenced by Śakra, so that in this episode the two are clearly
different protagonists; cf. T 1448 at T XXIV 68a15. The idea that Śakra was
the one to ask for the children can also be found in a Newar telling of the story,
Emmrich 2016: 191, and according to Tucci 1949: 469 in a Tibetan painted
scroll. A conflation of these two episodes could naturally occur in art, given
that in pictorial depiction there is a tendency to portray successive episodes in a
single image (cf., e.g., Schlingloff 1981), which could easily have led to the
Śakra motif being mistakenly related to the previous gift of the children as
well.


Vessantara (Jā 547)  135


undertaken for the sake of his full awakening. [52] As a result of this
different setting, the _Bhaiṣajyavastu_ concludes with the Buddha
only identifying the generous prince as a past life of his, without
any mention of Devadatta. [53]

The two settings conveniently illustrate how narratives can be
put to different uses within a _Vinaya_ framework. One such usage
is to provide to the monks a narrative background to legal matters,
here in particular schism, _saṅghabheda_ . Another usage is for narratives to be employed when teaching laity the importance of generosity. Needless to say, for a mendicant community like the Buddhist monastic order both concerns are of considerable importance. Whereas stories of monastic misconduct would not have
been suitable for public consumption, [54] [28] tales of the heroic exploits of the Buddha-to-be, like the Viśvantara narrative, would
have furnished Mūlasarvāstivāda monastics with convenient material for preaching purposes.

Such uses explain why _Vinaya_ literature can incorporate so
many tales, a tendency particularly evident in the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_, but also apparent in the _Vinaya_ texts of other schools.
_Vinaya_ texts as the source for rules to train monastics in behaviour and etiquette naturally lend themselves to the incorporation
of other material considered relevant for training monastics, such
as training their teaching skills. This almost inevitably leads to the
integration of various stories, which not only serve to attract (and
entertain) potential monastic reciters by providing narrative back

ground to legal matters, but also equip them with material that
can be employed in teaching activities.

Understood in this way, a discussion of a rule and a _jātaka_
found side by side in a _Vinaya_ text are not as surprising as this
may seem at first sight, since they express closely related concerns.
Thus a collection of tales like the _Mahāvastu_, as argued convincingly by Tournier (2012), is indeed a _Vinaya_ text.

According to Haribhaṭṭa's _Jātakamālā_, the delivery of _jātaka_ s
falls into place, once a sermon has been given, by way of illustrating
the teaching in additional detail, comparable to the light provided by
a torch, thereby becoming a source of happiness for the audience. [55]
This points to a function of _jātaka_ s as fleshing out abstract teachings
and, needless to say, at the same time also entertain the audience.
The edifying and entertaining aspects of _jātaka_ literature are also
noted by the Chinese pilgrim Yìjìng (義淨), [56] who is credited with
translating the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ into Chinese.

In modern days, as pointed out by Ladwig (2016: 57),


'giving' moral precepts and explaining virtuous models of
behavior … is considered one of the main tasks of a Buddhist
monk. An important part of sermon making is its performance
and aesthetics.


Combined with the setting in the _Bhaiṣajyavastu_, this helps to
explain another dimension of the success of the Viśvantara tale in
different Buddhist cultures. [29] Such success does not appear to be
in spite of its unusual encouragement of relentless giving, which
has a more natural home in the _Mahābhārata_, but quite probably
precisely because of this feature. Alongside the fruitful tension

this depiction creates with Buddhist ethical values, the basic portrayal of the Buddha-to-be engaging in such giving can serve to
encourage doing the same, albeit on a lesser scale. [57]

Cone and Gombrich (1977: xxv) note that "Buddhist monks
replaced brahmins as an economically parasitic class." Thus a tale
that portrays uncompromising willingness to give to brahmins can
easily be employed to encourage generosity to Buddhist monastics as those who have replaced the brahmins in Buddhist societies. Regarding the need for monastics to encourage giving, Findly
(2003: 337) explains that


several strategies are devised in order to capture donors'
attention within the marketplace of current young religious
movements, and to bind their attention to this particular
movement for the long term. The most important of these
strategies is the development of a doctrinal soteriology for
householders that deals with proper acquisition and use of
wealth and that provides a clear status-producing system of
merit for those who give to the Saṅgha.


The suggested function of the tale that emerges from the type
of setting depicted in the _Bhaiṣajyavastu_ accords with the results
of research done on teachings of the _Vessantara-jātaka_ in Theravāda societies. Spiro (1970/1982: 108) explains that

legend must have been an excellent example of charity, and this was the fact
which encouraged the Buddhist monks to adopt this legend for preaching charity. They not only adopted the existing tale, but also magnified the idea of
charity prevailing already in this pre-Buddhist legend and developed it into a
Buddhist legend by amalgamating it with the Buddha, bodhi and bodhisattva"
notions.

Vessantara is probably the best known and most loved of all
Buddhist stories. Its sacrificial idiom provides the charter for
and reinforces the Burmese belief in the religious efficacy of
giving.


Ladwig (2016: 60) reports from Laos that


monks like to employ it in order to point out the meritorious character of giving, refer to the great rewards Vessantara
received through his generosity, and motivate the laypeople to
follow his example on a more moderate level and make regular donations to the temple.


Alongside an encouragement to generosity, the dramatic setting of the tale, as a result of a fertile friction between a brahminical trope and Buddhist values, [30] also speaks to the audience
at several levels. Emmrich (2016: 191) explains one of the functions of the story to be


to encourage the female listeners to picture themselves as
Madrī and to put them into a position where they are forced to negotiate among the pressures of their own household duties, their
own affective marital expectations, and the anxieties produced by
the aspirations of their more or less bodhisattvalike husbands …
the telling of this story is as much an appeal to domestic piety as
an occasion when domestic unhappiness, its relentless and seemingly unchangeable nature, finds a public place of articulation.


Heim (2003: 538) notes that "the text gives direct cues – and
permission – to its hearer to feel apprehension and ambivalence."

These features taken together provide a meaningful background
to the success of the tale in the Buddhist traditions. Besides being
apt for popular teaching, however, the occurrence of the same tale


Vessantara (Jā 547)  139


in the _Saṅghabhedavastu_ points to the fact that entertaining stories
were not lost on the monastic reciters and their brethren. [58]

Here it also needs to be kept in mind that Mūlasarvāstivāda
monastics would quite probably have perceived the story of Viśvantara as a factual account of something that actually happened,
comparable to a background story in the _Vinaya_ that purports to
explain why the Buddha promulgated a particular _pārājika_ rule.
Both would have been experienced as equally 'real'.

In relation to the tale that depicts the promulgation of the first
_pārājika_ rule concerning celibacy, in a previous chapter I have
argued that the differences that emerge from a comparative study
of this story in various _Vinaya_ s show that such narratives reflect
the needs and concerns of those responsible for the teaching,
transmission, and codification of the different _Vinaya_ s, but not
necessarily what actually happened on the ground. [59]

The present study, together with the conclusions that suggest
themselves from a study of the background story to the _pārājika_
on killing and assisting in suicide, taken up in the previous chapter, [60] further confirms the need to consider _Vinaya_ narrative on its
own terms. Viśvantara's exploits form part of the narrative embedding of what for the early Buddhist monastic community appears to have been a major crisis: [31] the schism attempt by Devadatta. It thus stands on a par with the narrations related to the _pā_ _rājika_ rules on celibacy and killing. Nevertheless, the story of

nature, which are propitious for material prosperity but not for enlightenment."

Viśvantara hardly gives us a historically accurate picture of events
that took place in ancient India. What it does offer, instead, is a
window on the concerns, needs, and attitudes of those responsible
for the transmission and final shape of the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vi_ _naya_, and by extension of _Vinaya_ literature in general. It therefore
seems to me vital that a mode of reading _Vinaya_ narrative is found
that is able to accommodate similarly the depiction of events
leading to a monastic misdeed as well as a _jātaka_ like the one
studied in this chapter.


**Conclusion**

Basic elements of the tale known in the Pāli tradition as the
_Vessantara-jātaka_ appear to reflect the influence of a setting imbued with brahminical values and stand in conversation with that,
in particular with the trope, recurrent in the _Mahābhārata_, of the
host's duty to provide all and everything a begging brahmin might
ask for. The adoption of this story in the Buddhist traditions naturally finds its home within the scheme of perfections a bodhisattva
is expected to achieve on the path to Buddhahood. As a result of
this adoption, some aspects of the story contrast with the early
Buddhist normative ethical perspective.

The popularity of the tale among monastic teachers would
quite probably have been inspired by the potential of employing
the tale's depiction of relentless generosity to encourage giving
among lay supporters. The attraction held by the same tale among
Buddhist audiences would to some extent be the result of the fertile field of friction caused by the transposition of the basic plot
into the setting of the perfections, allowing room for the articulation of ambivalence and the cathartic experiencing of related
emotions.

The employment of the tale in the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_
points to twin concerns of monastic storytelling: fleshing out legal


Vessantara (Jā 547)  141


concerns through narrative embellishment and providing a convenient stock of tales for preaching purposes, especially for ensuring the continuity of a mendicant tradition by encouraging
generosity. Together with the background narration to various
rules, the occurrence of _jātaka_ tales in _Vinaya_ literature reflects
related aspects in the training of monastics and alerts to the potential as well as the limitations of such tales for reconstructing the
actual situation on the ground.


## **Gotamī (CV X.1) Part 1**

**Introduction**

In this chapter I translate a discourse preserved as an individual translation in the Taishō edition under entry number 60, which
reports the going forth of Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī. Since I have elsewhere studied the accounts of this event in detail, [1] in the present
chapter I instead survey different attitudes towards women that
emerge from this episode in the way described in T 60 and in
comparison to the current setting in Thailand.

Records of the going forth of Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī can be
found in a range of _Vinaya_ s, [2] as well as in discourses in the _Aṅ_ _guttara-nikāya_ and the _Madhyama-āgama_ . [3] [2] This conforms to a
general pattern already mentioned in previous chapters, where
some degree of overlap exists between material allotted to the collections of discourses and to the _Vinaya_, showing once again that
_Vinaya_ material is best read in conjunction with the discourses.

144  _Vinaya_ Studies


The Taishō edition attributes T 60, the version to be translated
below, to Huìjiǎn (慧簡). According to a suggestion by Mizuno, [4]
T 60 could be part of a group of discourses from a no longer extant _Madhyama-āgama_ translation by Zhú Fóniàn (竺佛念), undertaken by him during the period of time in which he also translated the _Ekottarika-āgama_ (still extant in the Taishō edition as
entry no. 125). Recent quantitative text analysis, however, has
shown that Mizuno's hypothesis is improbable. [5]

This _Madhyama-āgama_ collection translated by Zhú Fóniàn, as
well as the still extant _Ekottarika-āgama_, was orally transmitted by
the same reciter and brought to China, which makes it highly probable that both stem from a collection of discourses of the same Buddhist school. In contrast, discourses in the _Madhyama-āgama_ collection extant in Chinese translation by Saṅghadeva are so substantially different from their parallels in the extant _Ekottarika-āgama_
that these two collections must reflect quite distinct lines of textual
transmission and could not stem from the same school. [3]

This is significant for the case of T 60, translated below, [6] because this discourse is closely similar to the account of the going

6 [7] The translated discourse is T 60 at T I 856a7 to T I 858a6; the title given at T

I 856a4 is: 佛說瞿曇彌記果經. The title's indication that this is a discourse
"spoken by the Buddha", 佛說, is a regular feature of the titles of translated
works in the Chinese canon, where in most cases this probably does not render
an expression present in the original, but instead serves as a formula of authentication of the translated text. Regarding the reference in the title to 記果, "declaration on the fruit(s)", the character 記, a standard rendering of _vyākaraṇa_, does
not recur in the discourse. The character 果 makes its appearance again in the
context of Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī's reference to women's ability to attain the
four fruits of recluseship, which are the four levels of awakening. Therefore it

forth of Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī in the _Madhyama-āgama_ . [7] In view
of the differences, at times quite substantial, between other extant
versions that report her going forth, it seems safe to conclude that
T 60 and the _Madhyama-āgama_ discourse stem from very closely
related transmission lineages, [8] which in turn makes it highly probable that they were both transmitted by reciters belonging to the
wider Sarvāstivāda. [9] [4]


**Translation**

_Discourse on Gotamī's Declaration on the Fruits [of_
_Recluseship]_
Thus have I heard. At one time the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu, in the Nigrodha Park,
observing the rainy season together with a great community of
monks.

At that time Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī approached the Blessed
One. Having arrived, she paid homage with her head at the
Blessed One's feet and stood back to one side. Standing back
to one side, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī said to the Blessed One:

"Blessed One, would it be possible for women to attain the
four fruits of recluseship? [10] Will you not let women go forth in

seems fair to assume that the title would have such fruits in mind. Hirakawa
1982: 47f note 2 refers to T 60 just as _Gautamī-vyākaraṇa-sūtra_ . In my translation of [[MA116]] in Anālayo 2011d, I noted variations between [[MA116]] and
[[AN8.51]] these apply similarly to the case of T 60. In the present case, I instead
note variations found between T 60 and [[MA116]] in order to complement my
comparative studies in Anālayo 2011d and 2016b.

discipline out of serene faith, becoming homeless to train in
the path. Gotamī, you can always shave your hair, put on ochre
robes, and until the end [of your life] practise the pure holy life."

Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī, being restrained by the Blessed
One, paid homage with her head at the Blessed One's feet, circumambulated the Blessed One, left the Blessed One, and returned. [5]

At that time the monks were making a robe for the Blessed
One [thinking]: 'Soon the Blessed One, having completed the
rainy season among the Sakyans, the three months of the rainy
season being over, with his robes made and done, having his

[set of] robes completed, taking his robes and bowl, will journey among the people.'

Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī heard that the monks were making a

Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī, having been restrained again
by the Blessed One, paid homage with her head at the Blessed
One's feet, [6] circumambulated the Blessed One, left the Blessed
One, and returned.

Then the Blessed One, [856b] having completed the rainy season among the Sakyans, the three months of the rainy season
being over, with his robes made, having his [set of] robes completed, taking his robes and bowl, journeyed among the people.

Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī heard that the Blessed One, having
completed the rainy season among the Sākyans, the three
months of the rainy season being over, with his robes made,
having completed his [set of] robes, taking his robes and bowl,
had [set out to] journey among the people and villages. Having
heard it, together with some elderly women Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī followed the Blessed One.

They followed the Blessed One while the Blessed One was
journeying in stages [until] he arrived at Nādika, where he stayed
at a dwelling place in Nādika.

Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī approached the Blessed One,
paid homage with her head at the Blessed One's feet, and stood

Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī, having been restrained three
times by the Blessed One, paid homage with her head at the
Blessed One's feet, circumambulated the Blessed One, left the
Blessed One, and returned.

Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī stood outside the entrance, staring bleakly and weeping, her feet and body unwashed, and her
body covered with dust.

The venerable Ānanda saw from afar that Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī was standing outside the entrance, staring bleakly and
weeping, her feet and body unwashed, and her body covered
with dust. Having seen her, he said:

"Gotamī, for what reason are you standing outside the entrance, staring bleakly and weeping, your feet and body unwashed, and your body covered with dust?"

the path, shall receive the higher ordination, and become a nun."

The venerable Ānanda, having heard what the Blessed One
said, given proper attention to it, memorized and remembered
it, paid homage at the Blessed One's feet. He circumambulated
the Blessed One and, having left the Blessed One, returned. He
approached Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī. Having arrived, he addressed
Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī with these words:

"Gotamī, it has been obtained for women in this teaching
and discipline to go forth out of serene faith, becoming homeless to train in the path! Gotamī, the Blessed One said these
words: 'Women should practise eight weighty principles, which
they may not transgress, rules that women are to take up completely for their whole life.' What are the eight? [857b]

"Gotamī, a nun should seek higher ordination from the monks.
Gotamī, this is the first weighty principle the Blessed One has
set forth for women, which women may not transgress, a rule
that they are to take up completely for their whole life … _up_
_to_ … Gotamī, [even] if a nun has been fully ordained for [up to]
a hundred years, she should approach and pay homage at the
feet of a newly ordained monk, showing respect and reverence.
Gotamī, this is the eighth weighty principle the Blessed One
has set forth for women, which women may not transgress, a
rule that women are to take up completely for their whole life. [14]

"Gotamī, these are the eight weighty principles the Blessed
One has set forth for women, which women may not transgress,
rules that women are to take up completely for their whole life.
Gotamī, if you can take up these eight weighty principles completely, you shall in this teaching and discipline train in the path,
receive the higher ordination, and become a nun."

[Gotamī said]: "Venerable Ānanda, it is like this. You may
listen to my simile, on hearing a simile the wise will under

stand its meaning. Venerable Ānanda, it is just as if a warrior
girl, or a brahmin girl, or a skilled artisan[-class] girl, or a girl
from among common people, well washes and perfumes herself, putting on bright and clean clothes. Suppose there were a
person who thinks of her and sympathizes with her, desiring
her benefit and desiring her well-being. [This person] takes a
head wreath made of lotuses, or a head wreath made of _campaka_
flowers, or a head wreath made of _vassika_ flowers, or a head
wreath made of _atimuttaka_ flowers, and gives it to her. [18] She
accepts it by receiving it with both hands and places it on her
head. Venerable Ānanda, in the same way I shall receive on
my head for my whole life these eight weighty principles that
the Blessed One has set forth." [15]

[Ānanda said]: "Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī, you shall in this
teaching and discipline train in the path, receive the higher
ordination, and become a nun." [19]

Then, at a later time, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī was in the company of an assembly of elderly nuns, all of which were senior
and elder nuns who had been living the holy life together. She
approached the venerable Ānanda together with them. Having
reached him, she paid homage with her head at the venerable
Ānanda's feet and stood back to one side. Standing back to one
side, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī said to the venerable Ānanda:

"Venerable Ānanda, may you [know] that these nuns are all
senior elders who are living the holy life. [In regard to] those
monks who are newcomers to training in the path, who have recently come to this teaching and discipline, those monks should
approach these nuns, pay homage, and respect them according
to seniority."

[Ānanda said]: "Wait, Gotamī, I shall approach the Blessed
One. Having approached him, I shall speak about this to the
Blessed One." [Gotamī replied]: "I will now follow the venerable Ānanda's [suggestion]."

Then the venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One.
Having approached him, he paid homage with his head at the
Blessed One's feet and stood back to one side. Standing to one
side, the venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One: [857c] [16]

"Blessed One, today Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī, together with
nuns who are all senior and elder practitioners of the holy life,
approached me. Having reached me, she paid homage with her
head at my feet and stood back to one side. Standing back to
one side, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī said to me:

"'Venerable Ānanda, may you know that these nuns are all
senior elders who are living the holy life. [In regard to] those
monks who are newcomers to training in the path, who have
recently come to this teaching and discipline, those monks
should approach these nuns, pay homage, and respect them
according to seniority.'"

[The Blessed One said]: "Wait, Ānanda, you should guard
your words. Do not speak like this again. Ānanda, if you knew
what I know, you would not have let loose a single word, let
alone make such a suggestion.

"Ānanda, if in this teaching and discipline women had not
gone forth out of serene faith, becoming homeless to train in
the path, brahmins and householders would have put their
clothes on the ground. Having put their clothes on the ground,
they would have said: 'These recluses possess the practice of
morality. [20] Recluses, walk on this! Recluses, be very energetic,
so that we may for a long time derive benefit and welfare.'

"Ānanda, if in this teaching and discipline women had not

"Ānanda, it is impossible and cannot come to be, a woman
cannot assume five roles at all. She cannot be a Tathāgata, who
is free from attachment and fully awakened, or a wheel-turning
king, she cannot be Sakka, she cannot be Māra, and she cannot
be Brahmā. That is impossible.

"It is possible that a man can assume five roles. He can be a
Tathāgata, free from attachment, fully awakened, or a wheelturning king, he can be Sakka, he can be Māra, and he can be

The Buddha spoke like this. The venerable Ānanda heard
what the Blessed One had said and rejoiced in it with delight.


**Study**

In what follows I examine the above discourse from the viewpoint of a set of distinctions proposed by Sponberg (1992) for
identifying different attitudes towards women in early Buddhist
texts. The following three are of particular relevance to my study:

  - soteriological inclusiveness,

  - institutional androcentrism,

  - ascetic misogyny. [19]
Some degree of soteriological inclusiveness is reflected right
away in the title of the discourse, which highlights the fact that
here Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī herself raises the topic of women's
ability to attain the four fruits of recluseship. Except for the closely
similar _Madhyama-āgama_ account and the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vi_ _naya_, [22] the other versions do not provide a relation between her ini

tial request to be granted the going forth and the fruits of recluseship, but instead present this as a topic raised by Ānanda on a later
occasion, when intervening on behalf of Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī. [23]

Besides investing Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī with more agency, T
60 also offers a significant perspective on the Buddha's refusal.
Here, as well as in several other versions, this emerges with the
suggestion that Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī can live a celibate life, after
shaving off her hair and donning robes, presumably in the protected environment at home. [24] This changes a flat refusal to grant
ordination to women into what might reflect a concern that embarking on the life of a wandering mendicant at a time when the
Buddhist monastic order was still in its formative stages may involve hardships and dangers for women that make it advisable to
postpone such a move. [25] [20]

Alongside such indications, however, the discourse translated
above also stands out for expressing rather misogynist sentiments.
These become prominent in the last part, which depicts a whole
series of repercussions associated with the mere existence of an
order of nuns. [26] In the present discourse and its counterpart in the

_Madhyama-āgama_ this goes so far as to lead up to the proclamation of the five impossibilities for women, according to which a
female is unable to occupy the position of heavenly rulers like
Sakka, Māra, or Brahmā, or else in the human realm be a universal king or a Buddha. This type of presentation is also found in
the _Bahudhātuka-sutta_ and its parallels, where closer study shows
this doctrine to be a later addition. [27]

In this way, on the one hand T 60 succeeds in affirming the
soteriological agency of women and their potential to reach awakening and offers a solution to the otherwise perplexing refusal of
the Buddha to grant ordination to women. Indeed the very fact
that he does grant them ordination implies that Mahāpajāpatī
Gotamī's quest was in the end successful, which in turn sets the
starting point for Buddhist female monasticism that continues to
the present day. On the other hand T 60 also expresses misogynist
sentiments that are concerned with attributing any mishap a monk
may experience to the mere existence of nuns, which eventually
culminate in a proclamation of various impossibilities for women.

Alongside these instances of soteriological inclusiveness as
well as of ascetic misogyny, the same text also testifies to institutional androcentrism. [21] T 60 lists the eight _gurudharma_ s (Skt) or
_garudhamma_ s (Pāli), which in all versions of the foundation account express the subordination of nuns and thus unmistakably
stand for institutional androcentrism. In this way, the single text
translated above shows evidence of each of the three tendencies
identified by Sponberg.

In relation to these tendencies in the early texts in general,
Sponberg (1992: 3f) notes that "the characterization of ambivalence is misleading", since what we have here


is not a single … voice, but rather a multiplicity of voices,
each expressing a different set of concerns current among
members of the early community.


In the present case this multiplicity of voices converges on a
single text. By incorporating these three distinct type of voices, T
60 poses a challenge to one-sided interpretations of the attitude
towards women in early Buddhist texts. T 60 shows that, even in
the case of relying on a single text alone and without taking into
account epigraphic, archaeological, or other evidence, simple generalizations fail to capture the multivocality that pervades early
Buddhist discourse on women. [28]

The account of the formation of the Buddhist order of nuns has
had considerable impact on the modern-day situation, in various
ways influencing attitudes towards current attempts to revive the
Theravāda order of _bhikkhunī_ s. In fact in the modern setting the
same complexity in attitudes towards women can also be seen. In
what follows I briefly turn to _bhikkhunī_ s in Thailand as an illustration of the convergence of the same three attitudes, identified
by Sponberg, in a single situation. [22]

One of the developments that influences the situation of convergence I will be describing stems from a peculiarity in northern
Thai Theravāda Buddhist attitudes towards women. In some monasteries in the north of Thailand women are prohibited from entering sacred grounds. Behind this prohibition stands the fear that

a simple inconsistent ambivalence"; on the need to proceed beyond reading
into the texts either a consistently pro-women attitude or else a consistent
tendency towards patriarchal suppression cf. also Collett 2006 and 2009.

the purity and power believed to inhere in _stūpa_ s or _uposatha_
halls is in danger of becoming polluted through the presence of a
menstruating woman. [29]

An attempt in 2004 by senator Rabiabrat Pongpanit to promote
the abolishment of such prohibitions led to strong public opposition. [30] This documents that such attitudes are still very much alive in
modern times and not just a relic from the past. In terms of Sponberg's categories, for women to be prevented from entering certain
areas of a monastery is undeniably an expression of misogyny. [23]

I now turn from such taboos to the revival of the Theravāda
_bhikkhunī_ order, which is an ordination lineage that according to
our present knowledge did not reach Thailand in the past. [31] An

29 [30/31] Pichard 2000: 143 sums up that "dans le Nord de la Thaïlande … aujour
d'hui encore il est commun que l'accès de l' _ubosot_ y soit interdit aux femmes,
une pratique inconnue dans le reste du pays." Tanabe 1991: 188f explains that
"during menstruation women are prohibited from entering Buddhist monasteries … owing to the polluted and sinful nature of menstruation. Since menstrual
blood also has destructive effects on plants, they are prohibited from setting
foot in the kitchen garden, rice field or tobacco field … menstrual blood, the
focus of the uncontrolled female physiology, can disrupt a man's emotional
balance … the blood is dangerous and sometimes powerful because of its marginal and illegitimate nature." Commenting on the association of menstruation
with impurity as the basis for denying women access to sacred space, Kabilsingh 1991: 32 points out that "it is important to remember that such beliefs
and practices, the vestiges of which are still found among the Buddhist Sangha
in Thailand, are not Buddhist in origin and actually represent a corruption of
Buddhism." The Theravāda _Vinaya_ does in fact not provide a basis for such
apprehensions concerning menstruation. As pointed out by Langenberg 2016:
171, "in Buddhist Vinaya texts female blood is neither abominated nor venerated, but treated as a thing of practical consequence." According to Hüsken
2001, the _Vinaya_ ruling regarding the menstruation cloth does, however, appear
to have been formulated by taking brahminical concerns into account.

attempt by Narin Phasit to start an order of _bhikkhunī_ s led to a
Saṅgha Act promulgated by the Saṅgharāja of the Thai Saṅgha in
1928. This Saṅgha Act prohibits Thai _bhikkhu_ s from participating
in the ordination of women as _sāmaṇerī_ s, _sikkhamānā_ s, or _bhik_ _khunī_ s. [32] Similar to the ban on entering sacred ground, this prohibition is also not a mere relic from the past, but has been reaffirmed and at present is still the stance taken by the Thai Saṅgha
Supreme Council.

The successful revival of the _bhikkhunī_ order in Sri Lanka has
also affected Thailand, where by now gradually growing groups
of _bhikkhunī_ s can be found. In addition to the well-known _bhik_ _khunī_ Dhammanandā, based in the Bangkok area, a sizeable
group of _bhikkhunī_ s under the leadership of _bhikkhunī_ Nandañāṇī
live in the area of Chiang Mai. It is in relation to this group that a
convergence of the three attitudes identified by Sponberg can be
observed.

According to recent anthropological research, _bhikkhunī_ Nandañāṇī has been quite successful in establishing cordial relationships with local _bhikkhu_ s and cultivating mutual trust and cooperation with them. [33] Cooperation between _bhikkhunī_ s and _bhik_ _khu_ s in several aspects of monastic communal transaction is in
fact a need enshrined in the Theravāda _Vinaya_, reflected already
in the eight _garudhamma_ s mentioned in all accounts of the founding of the _bhikkhunī_ s' order.

One of these _garudhamma_ s requires the undertaking of _pavā_  _raṇā_, [24] a formal invitation to be extended after the completion of
the rains-retreat period, namely an invitation for any shortcoming
in behaviour to be pointed out. The formulation in the Theravāda
_Vinaya_ is as follows:

32 [34] Seeger 2006/2008: 160.
33 [35] For detailed studies cf. Itoh 2013 and Delia 2014.


Gotamī (CV X.1) Part 1  163


After the completion of the rainy season a _bhikkhunī_ should
make an invitation before both communities in respect to three
matters: what has been seen, heard, and suspected. [34]


Thus _bhikkhunī_ s need to extend such invitation not only to their
own community of _bhikkhunī_ s, but also to the community of _bhik_ _khu_ s. In contrast, _bhikkhu_ s only need to undergo _pavāraṇā_ in front
of the community of _bhikkhu_ s. In terms of Sponberg's terminology,
this is clearly an instance of institutional androcentrism.

At the same time, in the present-day situation in Thailand for
_bhikkhu_ s to participate in such a formal act of invitation constitutes equally an act of inclusiveness. Although such participation
falls short of fully violating the Saṅgha Act of 1928 against giving
ordination, it comes rather close to challenging it. By participating in a _pavāraṇā_ ceremony _bhikkhu_ s acknowledge the _bhikkhunī_
status of the female monastics who have come for this monastic
observance and thereby recognize their ordination as valid. Given
the normative association of ordination with progress towards
awakening, [35] such inclusiveness would in fact be not only institutional, but also of a soteriological type. [25]


――――――
34 [36] Vin II 255,14.
35 [37] This normative orientation is best summarized in the formulation em
ployed for the _ehi bhikkhu_ ordination, e.g., in Vin I 12,23 and 17,36, or the
more frequently found plural form _etha bhikkhavo_, e.g., in Vin I 12,37, 13,14,
19,30, 20,28, 24,4, 33,10+26, 34,3, and 43,4, which continues with the invitation to live the holy life for making a complete end of _dukkha_, _cara/caratha_
_brahmacariyaṃ sammā dukkhassa antakiriyāyā ti_ . For what appears to be an
instance of the same type of ordination given to a _bhikkhunī_ cf. Thī 109 and
below p. 177 note 25. The use of _etha bhikkhavo_ seems to be specific to such
ordination, in contrast to other contexts in the discourses which combine _etha_
instead with _bhikkhave_ (usually preceded by _tumhe_ ), such as, just to provide
one out of many examples, [[DN11]] at DN I 211,14; on the two terms _bhikkhave_
and _bhikkhavo_ cf. also Anālayo 2011b: 21f.


164  _Vinaya_ Studies


In addition to combining inclusiveness, which here is due to
the specific setting in Thailand, and institutional androcentrism as
a principle characteristic of this monastic observance, the third
strand of misogyny comes into play when such a ceremony is
conducted in an _uposatha_ hall which normally women are not allowed to enter. This is precisely what has happened recently at
Wat Phra That Sri Chomthong. Plate 3 below shows _bhikkhunī_ s
coming out of the _uposatha_ hall of Wat Phra That Sri Chomthong
after completion of the _pavāraṇa_ ceremony. [36] The picture shows
the senior-most of the _bhikkhunī_ s, who actually is from Sri Lanka,
followed by the Thai _bhikkhunī_ s, respectfully waiting for a moment as the last of the Thai _bhikkhu_ s is about to put on his slippers and depart. At the side of the entrance to the compound and
again at the actual hall, sign posts can be seen which prohibit
entry for women, see plate 4. [37]

This picture documents a combination of the three attitudes
identified by Sponberg within a single moment at a single place.
Although some degree of disobedience of Bangkok authorities is
not altogether surprising among the heirs to the Lanna tradition in
northern Thailand, the present instance documents the degree to
which good conduct and harmonious behaviour by the _bhikkhunī_ s
can make the difference. Such impact by the _bhikkhunī_ s on the
ground will be decisive in determining their acceptance by society
in Theravāda countries at large, probably more so than discussions
of the legal dimensions of _bhikkhunī_ ordination. [26/27]

The foundation history of the _bhikkhunī_ order in T 60 exemplifies the complexity of attitudes towards women in Buddhist litera

ture, where soteriological inclusiveness can be found just as institutional androcentrism and ascetic misogyny. Such multivocality
continues to the present day, a telling expression of which is the
undertaking of the _pavāraṇā_ ceremony by Thai _bhikkhunī_ s in an
_uposatha_ hall which otherwise prohibits women from entry. In
this way ancient text and modern-day situation converge in reflecting a complex situation that defies attempts at simplistic
evaluation.


## **Gotamī (CV X.1) Part 2**

**Introduction**

In the present chapter I critically review four theories regarding the foundation of the order of nuns: 1) the suggestion that the
account of the foundation of the nuns' order was devised only
after the division between the Sthavira and the Mahāsāṅghika
schools; 2) the assumption that an alternative account of this episode can be found in the _Maitrisimit_ ; 3) the conjecture that nuns
were in existence before Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī went forth; and 4)
the hypothesis that the order of nuns came into being only after
the Buddha had passed away. [106]


**1) Is the Prediction of Decline a Sthavira Tradition Only?**

In the context of an examination of various predictions regarding the decline of the true Dharma, Nattier (1991: 32) states that a
prediction about the impending decline of the teachings within
five hundred years due to the founding of an order of nuns is not
found "in the surviving literature of any of the Mahāsāṃghika
schools". She then concludes that


the idea of blaming the early demise of the Dharma on the
nuns developed sometime after the initial sectarian division
between the Sthavira and Mahāsāṃghika schools, but before
any further subdivisions within the Sthavira branch had taken
place … [the]date of the emergence of this tradition should
therefore be placed during the period 340-200 BCE. [1]

168  _Vinaya_ Studies


Closer inspection of the Chinese version of the Mahāsāṅghika
_Vinaya_, however, reveals that this absence is merely a case of abbreviation, as this _Vinaya_ refers to a more detailed account of
Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī's going forth preserved in a discourse. [2] This
conforms to a pattern discussed in previous chapters of there
being some degree of overlap between _Vinaya_ and discourse literature and again confirms that both are best read in conjunction.

Besides the abbreviated reference in the Mahāsāṅghika _Vinaya_
preserved in Chinese, the Sanskrit Mahāsāṅghika-Lokottaravāda
_Vinaya_ contains the full episode of the foundation of the order of
nuns, and therewith also the reference to the diminished duration
of the true Dharma, indicating that it will last for only five hundred years, instead of a thousand. [3]


――――――
1 [7] In a subsequent publication, Nattier 2004: 210 seems to still take the same

position, as she writes that the prediction "that Buddhism will endure for only
five hundred years … [is] found in the Vinaya texts of several different ordination lineages ( _nikāya_ ) … dating from perhaps a century or so after the Buddha's
death." I am not sure if I fully understand the remark in Gyatso 2003: 91 note 2
that in a personal communication "Nattier maintains that the Mahāsāṃghika
version of the story is garbled, suggesting it is a later interpolation." Later interpolations can probably be found in all extant accounts of the foundation of
the nuns' order, but for the present purposes it seems to me that, given that in
some form this prediction appears to be common property of the Buddhist
schools, it could not be considered a product of the Sthavira traditions only.

women to go forth, T 1425 at T XXII 492a22: 世尊乃至三制不聽度女人出家.

Thus the Buddha's refusal to allow women to go forth and his
prediction that the founding of an order of nuns will shorten the
lifetime of his teaching are elements also found in texts of the
Mahāsāṅghika tradition(s).


**2) An Alternative Account in the** _**Maitrisimit**_ **?**

According to Laut (1991), an alternative description of how
the order of nuns came into being can be found in the _Maitrisimit_,
parts of which have been preserved in Uighur and Tocharian.
Laut reports that in an Uighur version of this text Mahāpajāpatī
Gotamī tries to offer a robe to the Buddha out of gratitude for
having received permission to go forth. [4] [107]

The relevant part of the _Maitrisimit_, however, is merely an
embellished version of the events described in the introductory
section of the _Dakkhiṇāvibhaṅga-sutta_ . [5] The _Dakkhiṇāvibhaṅga-_
_sutta_ and its parallels record an occasion when Mahāpajāpatī
Gotamī, who apparently was a stream-enterer at the time of this
event, [6] tries to offer a robe to the Buddha, but is told that she
should rather offer it to the monastic community.

evidently was not aware of the edition by Roth, it is quite understandable that
she felt the absence of a full account in the Chinese translation of the Mahāsāṅghika _Vinaya_ to be significant.

Gewand überreichen möchte. Dies solle aus Dankbarkeit darüber geschehen,
daß er den Frauen die Gründung eines eigenen Ordens ermöglicht habe."

6 [12] This is implicit in the reference in [[MN142]] at MN III 253,29 to her firm faith,

_aveccappasāda_, in regard to the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Community, and
to her having become free from doubt in regard to the four noble truths. The
same holds for [[MA180]] at T I 722a12: 不疑三尊, 苦習滅道 and T 84 at T I
903c21: 佛無疑, 及法僧伽亦無疑惑, 乃至苦集滅道四聖諦理, 永斷疑見
(which adds that she had thereby forever left behind doubt and views), and [[DN170]]  _Vinaya_ Studies


Laut concedes that the _Maitrisimit_ does not explicitly refer to
the foundation of the nuns' order, though according to him this
should be understood to be implicit in the account, since going
forth would be the necessary condition for Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī's
claim to have become a stream-enterer. [7]

Thus Laut's identification of this section in the _Maitrisimit_ as
an alternative account of the foundation of the order of nuns rests
on his assumption that one needs to go forth in order to be able to
attain stream-entry. A stream-enterer, he explains, is one who has
reached the first level of the 'monastic' salvation career in Buddhism. [8] His suggestion seems to confound the monastic commu

181 comes to similar conclusions in regard to the Tocharian version. Taking a lead
from Pinault, Schmidt 1996: 276 then also considers this text to offer an account
of the foundation of the nuns' order. The need for a closer examination of Laut's
conclusion has already been noted by Hüsken 2000: 46 note 9, who remarked that
"the attainment of Śrotāpanna rank is not synonymous with the attainment of the
lowest grade of the Buddhist monastic path to salvation, as Jens-Peter Laut …
evidently assumes", wherefore "the text examined by Laut should be checked
again to determine whether it does in fact represent the ancient Turkish version of
the legend of the establishment of the Buddhist Order of nuns."

nity with the community of noble ones. Such confusion can easily
happen, since whereas the early discourses describe recollecting
the community in terms of noble ones, [9] the standard formula for
taking refuge speaks of the community of monks. [10] Yet, these two
types of communities are not identical and they do not imply that
one has to go forth to attain stream-entry, or even that those who
have attained stream-entry need to go forth.

On the contrary, the early discourses report a number of cases
where lay people attain stream-entry and even higher stages of
awakening without going forth. A famous example would be the
householder Anāthapiṇḍika, who according to the canonical
sources became a stream-entrant on his first meeting with the
Buddha, [11] but passed away after a life of devoted service to the
monastic community while still being a layman. [12] According to
the _Mahāvacchagotta-sutta_ and its Chinese parallels, quite a

9 [15] The standard description of the community of noble ones speaks of the

"four pairs of persons, the eight individuals" (comprising those who have
reached any of the four levels of awakening and those who are on the path to
each respective level), found e.g. in [[MN7]] at MN I 37,25: _cattāri purisayugāni_

Buddha had progressed considerably further on the path to awakening by reaching the stage of non-returning. [13] Not only nonreturning, but even full awakening appears to have been within
reach of the laity, as the case of Yasa suggests, who apparently
went forth only after having become an arahant. [14] [108]

Thus the attainment of stream-entry does not require going
forth and these two events can take place quite independently of
each other. In fact, the _Maitrisimit_ repeatedly refers to Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī as "queen" or "lady", [15] which suggests that, at
least from the perspective of this text, she was still a laywoman
when she attempted to offer a robe to the Buddha. This is not the
case for all versions of this event, as one record of her attempt to
offer a robe to the Buddha, preserved in Chinese translation, ex

be noted, however, that the listing of accomplished householders in [[AN6.119–]]
120 at AN III 450,21 does not refer to lay arahants, as seems to be assumed by
Harvey 1990: 218, Schumann 1982/1999: 217, Samuels 1999: 238, and Somaratne 2009: 153, as the description given of these householders only implies
that they had reached some level of awakening, not necessarily the highest
one. In fact [[AN6.44]] at AN III 348,3+5 reports that Pūraṇa and Isidatta, two
householders in the listing in [[AN6.120]] both passed away as once-returners.
15 [21] Gautamī is qualified as _qatun_ throughout the description of her attempt to

give the robe to the Buddha; cf., e.g., Geng and Klimkeit 1988: 192 (2548),
translated in ibid. p. 193,20 and elsewhere as "Königin" (except for an occurrence of _qatun_ in ibid. p. 198 (2623), rendered p. 199,5 as "Frau"). Von Gabain
1950: 309 s.v. _qatun_ gives "Gattin, Königin", and the index in Tekin 1980: 96,
s.v. _q'twn_, gives "Fürstin, Frau (hohen Ranges …)", with ibid. p. 70,2 translating the term as "Frau". Clauson 1972: 602 explains that "'the wife of the lord,
ruler' … is precisely the meaning of xatu:n in the early period." In the Tocharian version, Gautamī is qualified as _lāṃts_ / _lāts_, cf., e.g., YQ 1.25 1/2 [recto] [[AN8]]
in Xianlin et al. 1998: 168, translated in ibid. p. 169,18 (and elsewhere) as
"queen". For Tocharian B, Adams 1999: 548, s.v. _lāntsa_, gives "queen".


Gotamī (CV X.1) Part 2  173


plicitly introduces her as a nun. [16] Whether she was a nun at the
time of attempting to donate a robe to the Buddha or not, her attainment of stream-entry does not stand in any particular relation
to the foundation of the order of nuns, hence the _Maitrisimit_ does
not provide an alternative account of how the order of nuns came
into existence.


**3) Nuns Before Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī's Going Forth?**

Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī's attempt to offer a robe to the Buddha
has been the basis for yet another hypothesis, based on the account
of this offer given in the _Dakkhiṇāvibhaṅga-sutta_ . Williams (2000:
169) notes that according to the earlier part of this discourse Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī


keeps the five precepts. This clearly implies that this is
meant to have taken place before she was part of the Saṅgha,
members of which adhere to ten precepts for novices, and
many more for those who had taken higher ordination … she
is thus depicted as a lay person.


For her to be a laywoman, however, conflicts with a listing of
recipients of gifts in a later part of the _Dakkhiṇāvibhaṅga-sutta_,
which mentions gifts given to _bhikṣuṇī_ s. If at the time of this discourse Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī had not yet gone forth, a reference
to other nuns would be an anachronism, as according to the canonical accounts of the foundation of the nuns' order she was the
first nun in the Buddha's dispensation. Williams (2000: 170) concludes that "it would seem … that this is evidence of the existence
of bhikkhunīs _before_ Mahāpajāpatī requested the going forth." [17]

――――――

17 [23] The idea that Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī may not have been the first nun was

already advanced by Horner 1930/1990: 102, based on the circumstance that
in the _Apadāna_ Yasodharā is depicted as heading a substantial congregation of


174  _Vinaya_ Studies


Williams also envisages an alternative explanation, according
to which "this sutta may be an assimilation of one story with another." [18]

Closer examination of the _Dakkhiṇāvibhaṅga-sutta_ suggests
that Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī's status as a laywoman is not as unequivocal as it may seem at first sight. The reference to the five
precepts comes as part of a description of her taking refuge and
becoming a disciple of the Buddha, a description that employs
past participles. [19] Thus this passage appears to be a report of her
becoming a lay disciple at an earlier point of time, [109] without
thereby necessarily meaning that at the time of the _Dakkhiṇā_ _vibhaṅga-sutta_ she was still observing only the five precepts.

Regarding the gift of a robe, a stipulation found in the different _Vinaya_ s makes such a gift allowable if it comes from a monastic who is a relative. [20] Whether this regulation was in existence

nuns, cf. Ap 30.1 at Ap 592,8. The _Apadāna_ verses themselves, however, do
not seem to be related to the foundation of the nuns' order and thus offer little
support for Horner's hypothesis.
18 [24] Harvey 2000/2005: 386 similarly comments that "the conflict may arise from

_M_ . III.253–5 consisting of two originally separate passages being put together in
one text." Yet another explanation is suggested by Bodhi in Ñāṇamoli 1995/
2005: 1356 note 1291, assuming that perhaps the discourse "was later modified
after the founding of the Bhikkhunī Sangha to bring the latter into the scheme of
offerings to the Sangha". To me this seems to be less probable than Harvey's suggestion, since during such an editorial updating of the text it would have been
natural to simultaneously clarify the status of Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī, which could
have been done easily by including the granting of her going forth among the
favours she had received from the Buddha.

_surāmerayamajjapamādaṭṭhānā paṭiviratā_ .
20 [28] According to this regulation, a monk should not accept the gift of a robe from

a nun who is not related to him, which implies that such a gift is acceptable if they


Gotamī (CV X.1) Part 2  175


already at the time of Gotamī's offer or not, it would in principle
have been possible for her to try to offer a robe to the Buddha
while being a nun.

Thus, although the early part of the _Dakkhiṇāvibhaṅga-sutta_
reads more naturally if one assumes that Gotamī was still a laywoman, it does not offer unambiguous support for such a conclusion.

Besides, as briefly mentioned above, one of the Chinese parallels to the _Dakkhiṇāvibhaṅga-sutta_ explicitly introduces Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī as a nun, so that here the reference to having taken
the five precepts is made in relation to someone explicitly recognized to be a fully ordained nun at the time of the reported event. [21]
According to this version at least, her attempted offer of a robe
took place after she had gone forth and thus without creating any
anachronism in regard to the inclusion of nuns in the listing of
recipients of gifts in the same discourse.

If the _Dakkhiṇāvibhaṅga-sutta_ is nevertheless perceived as involving an anachronism, then this need not imply that nuns were
in existence before Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī went forth. Such a conclusion would conflict not only with the account of the foundation
of the order of nuns in the different _Vinaya_ s and in several canonical discourses, but also with the listing of eminent disciples in the
_Aṅguttara-nikāya_ and in the _Ekottarika-āgama_, which agree on
presenting her as outstanding among the nuns due to her seniority. [22] For Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī to be accorded this particular rank

implies that she was indeed the first nun to receive ordination, which
would also fit in naturally with her recurrent role in the different
_Vinaya_ s as a spokeswoman on behalf of the nuns. [110]

Although the _Dakkhiṇāvibhaṅga-sutta_ and its parallels combine Gotamī's attempt to offer a robe to the Buddha with a detailed listing of recipients of gifts, this is not the case for all records of this particular meeting between her and the Buddha. [23]
This suggests the possibility that the account of the attempted
offer of a robe to the Buddha and the description of recipients of
gifts might originally have been two separate textual pieces. During the course of oral transmission these two parts could then
have been combined to form a single account, a combination that
would have to have happened early enough in order to affect the
_Dakkhiṇāvibhaṅga-sutta_ of the _Majjhima-nikāya_ and its parallels.

Such combining of textual pieces of different provenance is
not an uncommon feature for literature that has been orally transmitted over longer periods of time. In the _Majjhima-nikāya_ itself,
several discourses appear to have incorporated material that seems
to stem from different contexts, or even from what originally might
have been commentarial explanations. [24] Thus the second of the
two alternative explanations suggested by Williams (2000: 170),


――――――
23 [31] T 203 at T IV 470a21 continues by describing how Maitreya accepted Ma
hāpajāpatī Gotamī's robe, after the Buddha had refused it. Thus T 203 does
not combine the offer of the robe with a listing of recipients of gifts. Another
case is the Mahīśāsaka _Vinaya_, T 1421 at T XXII 185b20, which precedes its
account of the foundation of the order of nuns with Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī's
attempt to offer a robe to the Buddha. Here, too, the question of recipients of
gifts does not arise. For a survey of these and similar tales cf. Lamotte 1958:
779–782 and for a study of Gotamī's gift of a robe Anālayo 2016b: 68–72.
24 [32] Examples would be the detailed description of various aspects of the path

in [[MN77]] at MN II 11,3 or [[MN151]] at MN III 295,13, or else the treatment of
supramundane path factors in [[MN117]] at MN III 72,16, all of which are not
found in their respective parallels; cf. Anālayo 2011b: 423f, 660f, and 848.


Gotamī (CV X.1) Part 2  177


according to which what appears like an anachronism in the _Dak_ _khiṇāvibhaṅga-sutta_ could be explained as the result of a merger
of two originally different texts, seems to offer a relatively straightforward solution. In contrast, proposing an existence of nuns before Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī went forth would not be based on unequivocal evidence from the _Dakkhiṇāvibhaṅga-sutta_, it would be
contradicted by one of the Chinese parallels to this discourse, and
it would conflict with a broad range of other canonical sources
transmitted by different Buddhist traditions regarding Mahāpajāpatī
Gotamī's role in relation to the foundation of the order of nuns. [25]


**4) The Nuns' Order Founded after the Buddha's Demise?**

Whereas Williams envisages the possibility that Buddhist nuns
existed earlier than generally assumed, von Hinüber (2008) argues that the order of nuns would have been founded only after
the Buddha had passed away. [111]

His proposal rests on several premises and therefore requires a
more detailed discussion than the theories examined so far. I will
review essential aspects of his proposition under three topics: [26]
the Buddha's contacts with nuns in the four Pāli _Nikāya_ s; a com

――――――
25 [33] References to the "come nun" ordination, e.g., in Thī 109, the Dharmagup
taka _Vinaya_, T 1428 at T XXII 714a17, in the (Haimavata?) _Vinayamātṛkā_, T
1463 at T XXIV 803b26, the Saṃmitīya _Vinaya_, T 1461 at T XXIV 668c21,
the Sarvāstivāda _Vinaya_, T 1435 at T XXIII 426b12, and the Theravāda _Vi-_
_naya_, Vin IV 214,6, could in principle be envisaged as taking place also after
Gotamī had gone forth, since the conferring of this type of ordination was a
prerogative of the Buddha and thus not affected by the evolution of ordination
procedures and regulations which his disciples are expected to follow.
26 In the original article I had discussed the terms _vuṭṭhāpeti_ and _pavattinī_ as an
other topic. In his reply to my criticism, von Hinüber 2015b: 197f clarified that
his discussion of these terms was not meant to have chronological implications.
Therefore I have decided to drop this as a topic on its own and will only comment briefly on the two terms in the course of what is now my third topic.


178  _Vinaya_ Studies


parison with the position of nuns in the Jain tradition; and von
Hinüber's hypothesis on how the order of nuns would have come
into being. I will examine each of these points in turn. [112/113]


**The Buddha's Interaction with Nuns**

Von Hinüber (2008: 21f) highlights that


the Buddha is never mentioned as talking to any individual
nun in the four Nikāyas of the Suttapiṭaka … when the Buddha
dies, no nun is present, only monks and gods. This is of considerable importance, because it is extremely difficult to imagine that it could have been possible to distort the report on the
_nirvāṇa_ and introduce or delete persons witnessing this event …
thus while the Buddha only talks about nuns or receives reports on nuns occasionally … he never talks to individual nuns
in any text of the four Nikāyas.


From a methodological perspective, it remains unclear to me
why talking to individual nuns is singled out as the main relevant
type of interaction between the Buddha and the nuns. Once the
canonical material is taken seriously as a potential source of historical information, which von Hinüber seems willing to do, then
all instances where nuns are shown to be in some relation to the
Buddha should be of relevance. In other words, any hypothesis
about the non-existence of nuns during the Buddha's lifetime
would also need to take fully into account records of the following:

  - the Buddha speaking to a group of nuns,

  - the Buddha speaking about individual nuns,

  - the Buddha speaking about a group of nuns,

  - individual nuns speaking to the Buddha,

  - a group of nuns speaking to the Buddha,

  - reports about an individual nun or a group of nuns given by

someone else to the Buddha. [114]


Gotamī (CV X.1) Part 2  179


All such instances would conflict with the assumption that the
order of nuns came into being only when the Buddha had already
passed away.

Besides the need to base a hypothesis on a comprehensive
survey of potentially contradictory evidence, in order to reach
conclusions about the history of early Buddhism a study of all
relevant sources is an indispensable requirement. For conclusions
of such significance, attempting a major revision of the history of
early Buddhist monasticism, it is not possible to restrict research
to the four Pāli _Nikāya_ s alone.

In the Pāli canon itself, the _Therīgāthā_ deserves to be reckoned
as relevant source material at least on a par with _Nikāya_ passages
such as the _Mahāparinibbāna-sutta_ . [27] The same applies to contacts
between the Buddha and nuns reported in the Pāli _Vinaya_ . [28]

Of even greater importance would be extending the research
beyond the confines of the Pāli canon, so as to take into account
the Chinese _Āgama_ s and _Vinaya_ s of other traditions. Since we do
not possess archaeological or epigraphic material on the
foundation of the order of nuns and thus have to rely entirely on


――――――
27 [38] The composite nature and relative lateness of several parts of the _Mahā_ 
_parinibbāna-sutta_ and its parallel versions have been highlighted by various
scholars; some of the relevant publications are: Rhys Davids 1910: 71–73,
Przyluski 1918, 1919a, 1919b, and 1920, Winternitz 1920/1968: 29–32,
Waldschmidt 1939/1967, Pachow 1945 and 1946, Waldschmidt 1948: 335–
354, Dutt 1957: 47, Pande 1957: 98–106, Williams 1970, Snellgrove 1973,
Bareau 1979, Norman 1983a: 37f, and [[AN2001]]
28 [39] Independently of whether the hypothesis regarding the origin of the _Mahā_ 
_parinibbāna-sutta_ as part of a chronological _Vinaya_ narration is accepted or
not (cf. Frauwallner 1956: 42–52), from the perspective of a stratification of
the Pāli canon the _Mahāparinibbāna-sutta_ is probably best considered on a
par with the narrative portions of the _Vinaya_, which need to be given similar
weight to the narration in the _Mahāparinibbāna-sutta_ if one attempts to reconstruct historical information based on textual sources.


180  _Vinaya_ Studies


textual records, with all the problems that this entails, it is all the
more imperative that the extant textual records are used in as
comprehensive a manner as possible.

In the present case, the Chinese _Āgama_ s are taken into consideration by von Hinüber on one occasion, [29] when in relation to
the _Dakkhināvibhaṅga-sutta_ he highlights (2008: 21 note 59)


the remarkable fact that some Chinese versions correctly
preserve a most likely older version of the text without any
reference to the nuns.


Unfortunately this is not correct, as the two Chinese parallels
to the _Dakkhināvibhaṅga-sutta_ refer repeatedly to the nuns. A
difference does occur in that, whereas a phrase in the Pāli version
speaks of a gift given to "the two communities headed by the

only of a gift given to "the community of monks headed by the
Buddha", as is also the case for a Gāndhāri fragment and a Tibetan version. [30] The same versions agree, however, on mentioning gifts given to the community of nuns, [31] or gifts to a group of
nuns, etc. [115]

Now von Hinüber is certainly right in highlighting that the
canonical sources refer less frequently to nuns than one would
have expected. A background for appreciating why nuns were not
present when the Buddha passed away could be gathered from
several _Vinaya_ rules. These rules reveal that close association between monks and nuns was prone to lead to criticism and to suspicions that they might be having amorous relations. To avoid
such suspicions and criticism, according to regulations recorded
similarly in the different _Vinaya_ s, monks were not allowed to set
out travelling together with nuns, or to embark with them in the
same boat; in fact a monk should not even teach nuns late in the
evening. [32] Evidently, contacts between nuns and monks were a
delicate matter. This in turn makes it only natural that nuns are
not mentioned in a description of the Buddha's passing away
during one of his journeys, as the very fact of him being on a
journey implies that he would have been accompanied by monks
and not by nuns. [33]

Not even the Buddha himself appears to have been above such
suspicions. The Pāli _Udāna_ collection reports that the female wanderer Sundarī was killed and her body buried in Jeta's Grove in

be gathered from the English translations of both discourses provided in Tsukamoto 1979/1985: 1093–1100, or from the extracts translated in Silk 2002/
2003: 149–150.
32 [43] The respective rules can be found in the codes of rules in the Dharmagup
taka _Vinaya_, T 1428 at T XXII 652b26, 652c29, and 650a12, in the Mahāsāṅghika-Lokottaravāda _Vinaya_, Tatia 1975: 21,15, 21,18, and 21,6, in the Mahīśāsaka _Vinaya_, T 1421 at T XXII 48b18, 48c13, and 46b12, in the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_, Banerjee 1977: 34,15, 34,18, and 34,8, in the Sarvāstivāda

order to discredit the Buddhist monks. [34] According to the commentary on the _Dhammapada_, this defamation was specifically
aimed at the Buddha, insinuating that he had taken his pleasure
with Sundarī, after which his disciples had killed and buried her
in order to hide the misdoings of their teacher. [35] A similar tale is
also found in the Chinese counterpart to the _Aṭṭhakavagga_ of the
_Sutta-nipāta_ . [36] The commentary on the _Bāhitika-sutta_ indicates
that this defamation even motivated King Pasenadi to question
Ānanda on the moral integrity of the Buddha, an enquiry also reported in the Chinese parallel. [37] The tale about Sundarī's murder
appears to have been well known throughout generations of Buddhists, as the travel records of the Chinese pilgrims Fǎxiǎn (法顯)
and Xuánzàng (玄奘) refer to the place where she was believed to
have been buried in Jeta's Grove. [38]

Another tale recorded in the Pāli tradition involves a female
wanderer by the name of Ciñcā-māṇavikā, who feigned being
with child and accused the Buddha of being responsible for her
pregnancy. [39] A similar story recurs in the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vi-_
_naya_ and in the Chinese _Udāna_ collection. [40] In this case, again,
Fǎxiǎn (法顯) and Xuánzàng (玄奘) knew a version of this
story. [41]

Gotamī (CV X.1) Part 2  183


Independent of whatever historical value one might assign to
these stories, [42] they do reflect ancient Indian concerns about relations between male and female wanderers or recluses. Such concerns make it only natural for the Buddha to avoid setting out
wandering in the company of his nuns.

In fact the same holds even when it comes to the Buddha's relations with his female lay supporters, such as, e.g., Visākhā or Ambapālī. In spite of otherwise regular meetings, the Buddha is not
portrayed as travelling together with his female lay supporters.

Such travel restrictions, if they can be called such, make it
more easily understandable why the canonical sources frequently
report that the Buddha addresses monks, who would regularly
have been with him on his wanderings, and why with considerably less frequency he speaks to female lay supporters living in the
places where he had come to. [116] Due to his itinerant lifestyle,
personal contacts with nuns would inevitably have been rather
infrequent. The same travel restrictions explain why at the time of
the Buddha's passing away nuns were not present, simply because
they did not accompany him on his wanderings.

Yet, even taking into account that relations between the Buddha and the nuns would naturally have been considerably less
frequent than with monks, the relative dearth of passages that
record the Buddha directly speaking to nuns remains remarkable.

However, references to the Buddha directly speaking to nuns
are not entirely absent from the four Pāli _Nikāya_ s. In addition to a
discourse in the _Saṃyutta-nikāya_, according to which the Buddha
delivered a discourse on the nature of a stream-enterer to a group
of one hundred nuns, [43] a discourse in the _Aṅguttara-nikāya_ reports how the Buddha gave a succinct instruction on the chief

principles of the Dharma to Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī, when they
were both at Vesālī. [44] This discourse is thus located at the same
venue where according to the canonical account the order of nuns
was founded, which would fit the assumption that she should be
considered to have already have been a nun when receiving this
teaching. For her to be receiving these instructions as a lay disciple, it would be more natural if the discourse had been allocated
to her home town Kapilavatthu.

Two aspects of this discourse further support the impression
that she is probably best reckoned to have been a nun at the time
of the delivery of this discourse. One of these is that her request
to be given an instruction in brief for intensive solitary practice
employs a pericope used elsewhere in the Pāli discourses consistently by monastics. [45]

The other aspect supporting this impression is that the Buddha
replies to her request for a such a brief instruction by recommending the development of a set of qualities, one of which is that she
should be "easy to support", _subhara_, instead of being "difficult
to support", _dubbhara_ . [46] These qualities appear to refer to the re

lationship between a monastic and his or her lay supporters; in
fact elsewhere in the four Pāli _Nikāya_ s these terms recur in explicit relation to a monastic. [47] Thus the location, the formulation
of her request, and the phrasing of the Buddha's reply make it safe
to assume that Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī should be seen as having already become a nun at the time of this discourse.

Besides, the fewness of reports where the Buddha directly addresses nuns could be a characteristic of the Theravāda tradition in
particular. Roth (1970: xl) notes that, according to the description of
the promulgation of rules for nuns in the Mahāsāṅghika-Lokottaravāda _Vinaya_, Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī regularly approaches the Buddha to report cases of misconduct personally to him. [117] In the Theravāda _Vinaya_ such cases happen only rarely, [48] as here the role of
reporting a matter to the Buddha is usually taken by the monks instead, who have been informed about what has happened by the
nuns. In the Dharmaguptaka, Mahīśāsaka, Mūlasarvāstivāda, and
Sarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ s such meetings between Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī and the Buddha occur more regularly. [49] In this respect the The

ravāda _Vinaya_ seems to be the version that reports the least number
of direct contacts between Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī and the Buddha.

The same pattern seems to manifest also in the Pāli _Nikāya_ s.
An example would be the _Nandakovāda-sutta_, where von Hinüber
(2008: 24) rightly highlights that the Buddha, on being asked by
Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī to instruct the nuns, "does not even talk to
her". [50] The same is not the case in a Chinese parallel, in a Sanskrit
fragment parallel, and in a discourse quotation found in the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_, preserved in Chinese and Tibetan. All these
parallel versions agree in reporting that the Buddha personally
gave teachings to Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī and to the nuns who had
come together with her. [51]

A similar instance is the _Cūḷavedalla-sutta_, where in the Pāli
version the nun Dhammadinnā does not have any direct contact
with the Buddha. In the Chinese counterpart, she personally speaks
to the Buddha, a circumstance also reported in a Tibetan version
of this discourse. [52]

Gotamī (CV X.1) Part 2  187


In addition to this apparent tendency in Theravāda texts to
minimize contacts between the Buddha and nuns, it also needs to
be taken into account that at times references to monks in Pāli
discourses may implicitly include the nuns. [53] [118]

In sum, the absence of references to the Buddha directly conversing with nuns, or any lack of explicit mention made of nuns,
appears to be characteristic of the Theravāda reciters in particular.
This shows the shortcomings caused by the problem mentioned
above, since restricting the range of sources to be examined to the
four Pāli _Nikāya_ s necessarily results in a partial picture. This can
only be rectified when all available sources are taken into account.

The methodological problem of adequate examination of the
textual sources can also be demonstrated with cases like the _Nan_ _dakovāda-sutta_ or the _Cūḷavedalla-sutta_, since these discourses
are testimonies to contact between the Buddha and the nuns in all
versions, including the Pāli accounts. It is only when the frame of
examination is narrowed down to instances where the Buddha directly addresses an individual nun that even the information provided by the Pāli discourses is lost sight of.


**Comparison with the Jain Tradition**

Von Hinüber (2008: 24) compares his assessment of the attitude towards nuns in early Buddhism with what he considers a


very different attitude to nuns reflected in Śvetāmbara Jaina
texts … [where] Mahāvīra himself personally communicated
with the chief nun Candaṇā … in contrast to Buddhism, there
is neither any trace of reluctance to accept nuns nor are there
separate sets of rules for monks and nuns in Śvetāmbara Jainism.

――――――
53 Cf. in more detail Collett and Anālayo 2014.


188  _Vinaya_ Studies


Von Hinüber's reference to a particular occasion where "Mahāvīra himself personally communicated with the chief nun Candaṇā" appears to be based on Schubring, [54] [119] [ yet the relevant ]

passage in the work by Schubring only reports that Mahāvīra
brought his 'mother' Devāṇandā to the nun Candaṇā, without
mentioning any form of communication. [55] The corresponding passage in the _Viyāhapannatti_, which is the source text referred to by
Schubring, just reports that, after having himself given the going
forth to his 'mother', [56] Mahāvīra personally handed her over to the
nun Candaṇā. [57] Thus this particular instance does not record any
"personal communication between Mahāvīra and Candaṇā" and
would fall short of fulfilling the criteria von Hinüber applies to
Buddhist texts, where he only considers instances to be relevant if
they record a direct communication between the Buddha and an
individual nun.

placed him into the womb of another woman; cf. _Jinacaritra_ (26) in Jacobi

disciples was more than doubled that of their male counterparts. [58]
Yet, the scriptures of the Jain canon do not give nuns the prominent
place one would have expected in the light of such figures, as their
occurrence, or even references to them, fall far behind the ratio
given in the _Jinacaritra_ . In this way a perusal of Jain texts gives the
impression that the same pattern may have been operative in Jain
and in Buddhist texts, in that the degree to which nuns occur in the
respective canons probably reflects the predilection of the respective
male reciters more than actual historical conditions.

In relation to personal contact between the nuns and Mahāvīra,
it is instructive to turn to the _Antagaḍa-dasāo_ ( _Antakṛddaśā_ ), the
eighth _aṅga_ of the Jain canon. This work contains a series of legends of saints, depicting their life from the time before their conversion until their final fast to death. According to Jain customs,
permission from one's teacher is required before beginning such
fasting to death. In the case of monks, the _Antagaḍa-dasāo_ reports
that such permission was personally given by the leader of the
community, Mahāvīra or one of his predecessors, Ariṣṭanemi. [59]
But when describing such action undertaken by nuns, the last
chapter of this work reports that such permission is requested
from and then given by Ajja Candaṇā. [60] Thus here, too, a canoni

――――――
58 [72] The _Jinacaritra_ (134f) counts 14,000 monks and 36,000 nun disciples

under Mahāvīra. According to the same work, nuns outnumbered monks
already under several of Mahāvīra's predecessors, thus the _Jinacaritra_ counts
16,000 monks and 38,000 nuns under Parśva (161f); 18,000 monks and
40,000 nuns under Ariṣṭanemi (176f); and 84,000 monks and 300,000 nuns
under Ṛṣabha (214f); cf. Jacobi 1879/1966: 66, 69, 71, and 75.
59 [73] The first story of Goyama, Modi 1932: 4,15 (pagination of the text edition; cf.

also Barnett 1907/1973: 58), sets the pattern for such requesting of permission,
which then applies to subsequent stories that are given in an abbreviated manner.

then granted by Ajja Candaṇā.


190  _Vinaya_ Studies


cal text gives the distinct impression that the nuns did not have
the same type of personal contact with the leader of the community as the monks.

Another instance of interest is the tale of a female predecessor
of Mahāvīra by the name of Mallī, whose story is narrated in the
_Nāyādhammakahāo_ ( _Jñātādharmakathā_ ), the sixth _aṅga_ of the
Jain canon. The Śvetāmbara version of this tale describes Mallī's
youth as a princess and her renunciation. [120] As noted by Roth
(1983: 48), during the later part of this description, beginning
with the moment that she is qualified as an arhat, the text switches
to employing masculine forms to refer to Mallī, even though she
is still a woman. [61] The Digambara version of this tale in fact
speaks from the outset of male Malli instead, describing 'his'
youth as a prince, 'his' going forth, and 'his' awakening. [62]

The shift from female Mallī to male Malli reflects the view,
firmly held by the Digambara Jains, that women are by nature incapable of attaining liberation. [63] According to Schubring (1962/
2000: 61), a Jain work by the title _Chappāhuḍa_ even goes so far
as to conclude that, given that women cannot reach liberation,
there should be no nuns at all.

Although such doubts about women's capabilities to reach
liberation need not have been in circulation already at the time of
Mahāvīra and the Buddha, they nevertheless stand in stark contrast to the early Buddhist attitude, where the canonical texts acknowledge women's ability to attain all four stages of awakening,
something mentioned explicitly in several canonical accounts of
the foundation of the order of nuns. [64]

Gotamī (CV X.1) Part 2  191


Another point raised in the passage by von Hinüber, quoted
above, is that the Jain texts do not report any "reluctance to accept
nuns". Given that we do not have an account of the foundation of
the Jain order of nuns, it would be difficult to come to a conclusion regarding the presence or absence of any reluctance when the
Jain order of nuns was founded.

Regarding the formulation of rules, in the sense that according
to von Hinüber there are no "separate sets of rules for monks and
nuns in Śvetāmbara Jainism", it seems uncertain to what degree
such formulations can be taken as indicators of an equal treatment
of monks and nuns. It could just as well be argued that the Buddhist nuns are given more importance by having rules addressed
to them specifically, instead of just being included in the rules
formulated for monks. In fact, according to Deo (1956: 501) the
monastic regulations of the Digambara Jains tend not to mention
nuns at all, let alone treat them on a par with monks.

Even in the case the Śvetāmbara Jains, the difference between
their mode of presenting rules for nuns and the Buddhist monastic
regulations is perhaps not as clear-cut as it might seem at first sight.
For example, the _Vavahāra_ ( _Vyāvahāra_ ), one of the _Cheda-sūtra_ s
of the Śvetāmbara canon and thus a text of central importance for
Jain monastic discipline, presents some rules for monks and nuns
separately, in subsequent chapters of its treatment, [121] even though
the actual formulation of these rules (except for replacing masculine forms with their feminine counterparts) is the same. [65]

Moreover, closer inspection brings to light rules that do not
breathe a spirit of equality. Thus two rules in the _Vavahāra_ stipulate that a nun can ascend to the position of _upādhyāya_ after hav――――――

note 43 and p. 18 note 46 refers to these two chapters in the _Vavahāra_, so that
he would have been aware of the above quoted rules, which perhaps he did
not consider to fit the category of "set of rules".

ing been ordained for thirty years, while she can become an _ācārya-_
_upādhyāya_ once she has completed sixty years. In contrast, a
monk needs to have been ordained for only three years to become
an _upādhyāya_ and after five years he can take up the position of
an _ācārya-upādhyāya_ . [66] This corroborates the observation by von
Glasenapp (1925/1999: 376) that in Jainism "the rules for nuns in
parts are stricter than those for monks." [67] Thus it seems that Jain
nuns may not have fared substantially better in this respect than
Buddhist nuns, who have to observe more rules than their male
counterparts.

Jain (1947: 153) explains that Jain nuns were not allowed to
study certain texts, the reasoning being that "women are not strong
enough and are fickle-minded." To my knowledge a comparable
restriction on textual study does not appear to be reflected anywhere in the early Buddhist texts.

Balbir (2002: 70) notes that,


except in recent times … Jain women have not been able to
speak for themselves: almost all the texts we have inherited
from the past are written by monks or are male-oriented, and
no really innovative dogmatic treatise is known to have been
composed by any woman of the tradition.

A contrast to this could be provided with the example of the
collection of verses by Buddhist nuns, the _Therīgāthā_ . [68]

In sum, instead of a substantially better position for nuns in the
Jain tradition, compared to Buddhist nuns, the above survey suggests that ancient Indian patriarchal attitudes towards women in
general and nuns in particular had their impact on both traditions.


**The Order of Nuns Founded after the Buddha's Death?**

Von Hinüber (2008: 27) introduces his conclusions by stating
that,


taking all the evidence preserved in the texts together … it
is not easy to avoid the conclusion that the introduction of the
order of nuns was indeed an event at the end of the period of
early Buddhism, not too long after the death of the Buddha. [122]


Due to restricting himself to the four Pāli _Nikāya_ s and confining his evidence to instances where the Buddha speaks to individual nuns, von Hinüber's conclusions unfortunately do not "take all
the evidence preserved in the texts together" into account. Once a
text like the _Mahāparinibbāna-sutta_ is treated as a reliable source
of historical information (about the absence of nuns on the occasion of the Buddha's decease), the same status would have to be
accorded to the range of other discourses and _Vinaya_ passages
that document the existence of the order of nuns during the Buddha's lifetime. [69]


――――――
68 [82] The _Therīgāthā_ is not the only such instance in the history of Buddhism;

another similar case would be the records of eminent nuns in China during the
fourth to sixth century, T 2063, translated in Tsai 1994.
69 [83] Several such instances from the Pāli _Nikāya_ s have been referred to by von

Hinüber 2008: 20 note 53 and 22–24 himself. Due to focusing only on those
instances where the Buddha directly addresses nuns, however, he does not
seem to consider these instances as conflicting with his hypothesis.


194  _Vinaya_ Studies


In reply to my criticism of his hypothesis, von Hinüber (2015b:
198) argues that "concentration on the Theravāda tradition is … a
methodological necessity. Only the oldest levels of the Buddhist
tradition we can reach might occasionally tell something about
the very early history of Buddhism." Certainly the oldest levels of
the Buddhist tradition need to be examined, but there is no _a priori_
reason why these oldest levels should be found only in Pāli texts. [70]

In sum, the methodological shortcoming surveyed above suffice to dismiss the proposed theory as lacking sufficient grounding in the relevant evidence.

In what follows I nevertheless continue to examine the implications of von Hinüber's proposal, which confirm its implausibility. On the assumption that the Buddha did not found an order of
nuns, it is difficult to conceive of anyone who could have started
such an order once the Buddha had passed away, just as it is hard
to imagine how anyone could successfully have carried out such a
revolutionary action as founding an order of nuns on his or her
own.

Regarding the how of such an innovation, since tradition attributes the origin of all _Vinaya-_ related actions to the Buddha, an
innovation of such a type, without having a precedent in a permission or legislation by the Buddha, would have faced insurmountable obstacles as long as the early generations of disciples, especially his faithful attendant Ānanda, were still alive. Their regard
for their deceased teacher would have been too strong to allow
them to embark on something they knew the Buddha had (supposedly) never sanctioned.

The accounts of the first _saṅgīti_, to be discussed in the next
chapter, clearly reflect a move towards traditionalism, expressed
in the narration that the rules, whose abolishing the Buddha had


――――――
70 Cf. in more detail Anālayo 2016e.


Gotamī (CV X.1) Part 2  195


sanctioned, were not abandoned. [71] This makes an innovation of
such magnitude a highly improbable, if not impossible, event.

Even to put such a move into operation in later times would
have been exceedingly difficult, and the greater the time distance
from the Buddha's lifetime becomes, the more difficult it would
be to canonize such an act in the orally transmitted texts of different Buddhist schools. Von Hinüber (2008: 25) assumes that


the Buddhists … had to give in to some sort of social
pressure from outside … and were forced … to establish an
order of nuns. [123]


He gives no reference for this suggestion; in fact it would be
difficult to provide support for the notion of social pressure in
ancient India in favour of establishing an order of nuns.

Given that the _Vinaya_ s portray the Buddha as someone willing
to lend an ear to general opinion, had such social pressure been in
existence during his lifetime, it would run counter to his character
portrayal in the canonical sources to assume that he did not lend
an ear to it. If, however, we suppose that such social pressure came
into being only afterwards, then the foundation of the order of
nuns would have to be placed at a considerable temporal distance
from the Buddha's lifetime in order for such social pressure to
come into existence and build up to a level sufficiently strong to
exert its influence.

Besides, the assumption of a social pressure in favour of starting an order of nuns after the Buddha's lifetime does not fit too
well with the little we know about the ancient Indian situation.
Although several texts point to some degree of freedom for
women during Vedic and early Upaniṣadic times, their position
seems to suffer a gradual decline until it reaches a low with the

196  _Vinaya_ Studies


_Manusmṛti_ . [72] The further we advance in time, the less one would
expect public opinion to be in favour of establishing an order of
nuns. This, too, makes it highly improbable that any faction in the
Buddhist community would have been motivated to undertake
such an innovation, let alone have been able to carry it through.

Regarding the who of such an innovation, tradition unanimously presents Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī as the foster mother of the
Buddha. This implies that she would have been considerably
older than him, in fact several texts report that she passed away
before the Buddha. [73] Had she still been alive, then by the time of
the Buddha's passing away she would have been a centenarian at
least, making her an improbable candidate for starting an order of
nuns at a still later time. Yet, this seems to be what von Hinüber
(2008: 20) has in mind. After noting that when Mahāpajāpatī
Gotamī approaches the Buddha at Vesālī,


Gotamī and all the Sākiyānīs look like a group of female
ascetics with their leader … the particular vocabulary in the
rules for nuns can be explained easily as remnants of the peculiar linguistic usage of these female ascetics in their own rules
at the time before they converted to Buddhism.


Von Hinüber (2008: 21) continues by referring to this "group
of female ascetics joining Buddhism", concluding that "the _saṃgha_
of nuns is created by accepting the whole group of ascetics accompanying Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī." Thus here Mahāpajāpatī
Gotamī and her followers are turned into actual female ascetics
who have gone forth under a non-Buddhist teacher, even though
there is no real evidence that they ever did so. [124]

Gotamī (CV X.1) Part 2  197


The reference to a "peculiar linguistic usage" in the quote
above relates to the observation by von Hinüber (2008: 17) that,
instead of the term _upasampādeti_, the _Bhikkhunī-vibhaṅga_ uses
_vuṭṭhāpeti_ to designate the ordination of nuns. The same text also
employs the term _pavattinī_ to refer to a nun's teacher, instead of
_upajjhāya_ . To explain this departure from the terminology used
for monks, von Hinüber (2008: 19) reasons that "the vocabulary
of the ordination of nuns must have come from outside Buddhism."
The same would hold for many other technical terms employed in
the _Vinaya_, which similarly would stem from the terminology in
use among ancient Indian recluses and wanderers.

Now, had the Buddhist order of nuns come into existence only
after the Buddha's demise, it can safely be expected that terms for
ordination would just have been copied from the _Bhikkhu-vibhaṅga_ .
Employment of the same terminology as found in the _Bhikkhu-_
_vibhaṅga_ would also be more probable in view of the natural tendency of oral transmission towards levelling and uniformity, evidenced in the circumstance that, as noted by von Hinüber (2008:
17), " _vuṭṭhāpeti_ found in the Pātimokkha for nuns disappears in
the Cullavagga." As von Hinüber (2008: 19) explains, in this way


the term _vuṭṭhāpana_ was replaced by _upasampadā_ in the
Khandhaka … following the model of the terminology used in
the rules for monks.


Thus the shift of terminology in this respect makes it probable
that the _Bhikkhunī-vibhaṅga_ reflects an ancient tradition, rather
than a later invention in order to pretend that nuns were already in
existence at the Buddha's time.

Whatever may be the final word on the occurrence of specific
terminology like _vuṭṭhāpeti_ and _pavattinī_ in the _Bhikkhunī-vi_ _bhaṅga_, it certainly does not just turn Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī and
her followers into female ascetics who have gone forth under [[AN198]]  _Vinaya_ Studies


non-Buddhist teacher. To draw out the implication of this assumption: after her initial request to be allowed to become a
Buddhist nun has met with the Buddha's refusal, Mahāpajāpatī
Gotamī (who as a stream-enterer would according to the traditional understanding have been unable to follow a non-Buddhist
teacher) [74] goes forth as a nun under a non-Buddhist ascetic, together with her following. Once the Buddha has passed away,
Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī manages to transform herself and her
following of female ascetics into Buddhist nuns, which earlier
was not possible because of the Buddha's refusal. Nobody is able
to stop them from doing something that everyone knew had not
been sanctioned by the Buddha. Those sympathetic with her
action devise a canonical account of the foundation of the nuns'
order that attributes this innovation to the Buddha himself and
gives some room to those against this innovation by reporting the
Buddha's initial refusal, an account that is then successfully inserted in the _Vinaya_ s and other canonical scriptures of the different Buddhist schools. [125]

This scenario conflicts with about "all the evidence preserved
in the texts together". The textual evidence at our disposal rather
implies that Buddhist nuns were in existence at the Buddha's time
and that their order came into being when he was still alive.


**Conclusion**

The hypothesis that the order of nuns only came into being
after the Buddha's demise fares similarly to the suggestion that
the account of the foundation of the nuns' order was devised only
after the division between the Sthavira and the Mahāsāṅghika

schools, the assumption that an alternative account can be found
in the _Maitrisimit_, and the conjecture that nuns may already have
been in existence before Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī went forth. None
of these theories has been able to develop a convincing perspective on how the Buddhist order of nuns came into existence.

The arising of these explanatory attempts, although failing to
provide a satisfactory solution, highlights the problematic nature
of the canonical accounts of the foundation of the order of nuns,
which are difficult to reconcile with the way other canonical texts
portray the Buddha and his attitudes.

Not taking into account some relevant source(s) seems to be a
central factor undermining the conclusions arrived at in the case
of each of the four theories reviewed above. Just to summarize
the situation in this respect:

The hypothesis (1) that the account of the foundation of the
nuns' order was devised only within the Sthavira tradition(s) does
not take into account the Lokottara-Mahāsāṅghika _Vinaya_ preserved in Sanskrit.

The assumption (2) that an alternative account can be found in
the _Maitrisimit_ does not take the _Dakkhiṇāvibhaṅga-sutta_ and its
Chinese parallels into consideration and falls short of appreciating
the canonical records of lay disciples who have reached various
levels of awakening.

The conjecture (3) that nuns may already have been in existence before Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī went forth stands in contrast to
one of the Chinese parallels to the _Dakkhiṇāvibhaṅga-sutta_ and to
the canonical sources that depict her role as an eminent disciple,
her activities as a spokeswoman for the nuns in relation to various
_Vinaya_ regulations, and her position as the woman instrumental in
getting the Buddha's permission to start an order of nuns.

The suggestion (4) that the order of nuns was founded only after
the Buddha's demise does not give adequate consideration to ca

200  _Vinaya_ Studies


nonical passages that imply the co-existence of the Buddha and
the nuns and leaves out of the account relevant canonical texts
found outside of the four Pāli _Nikāya_ s.

Examining these hypotheses shows that any attempt at solving
this enigma needs to be based on a comprehensive survey of the
relevant textual material. [75]

**Introduction**

In this chapter I explore the significance of the account of the
first _saṅgīti_ in the different _Vinaya_ s and their report that the assembled monks decided not to abolish the minor rules. In the final
part of my study I turn in particular to the impact of this decision
on the formation of the sense of monastic identity in the Theravāda tradition.


**The Convocation of the** _**Saṅgīti**_ **and the Minor Rules**

According to the _Mahāparinibbāna-sutta_ and its parallels, at
the time of the Buddha's decease Mahākassapa was travelling together with a group of monks. On hearing the news that the Buddha had just passed away, a monk in this company reportedly expressed his satisfaction to be now free to do as he likes. According to the _Dīrgha-āgama_ parallel to the _Mahāparinibbāna-sutta_
his statement was as follows:

_Saṅgīti_ (CV XI)  203


  - the Theravāda _Vinaya_ extant in Pāli. [10]
According to these canonical accounts, Mahākassapa conceived of the need to convene a _saṅgīti_ in response to this episode. [11] In other words, the event of the first _saṅgīti_ is presented in
the canonical sources as being from the outset related to the perceived need to ensure adherence to _Vinaya_ rules and regulations. [12]

The topic of adherence to _Vinaya_ rules then takes centre stage
in the account of the actual proceedings in relation to a permission given by the Buddha (reported also in the _Mahāparinibbāna-_
_sutta_ and its _Dīrgha-āgama_ parallel) that the minor rules can be
abolished after his passing away. [13] [3]

According to the Mahāsāṅghika _Vinaya_, the Buddha had even
asked Ānanda to remind him of the need to abolish the minor rules
himself before passing away. At the first _saṅgīti_ Ānanda then has
to face criticism for not having reminded the Buddha to do this. [14]

204  _Vinaya_ Studies


The other _Vinaya_ s, however, agree with the _Mahāparinibbāna-_
_sutta_ and its _Dīrgha-āgama_ parallel that the Buddha had only
given permission to abolish these rules, without suggesting that
he had intended to do so himself.

The Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ reports Mahākassapa censuring
Ānanda for not having ascertained which of the different rules fall
into the category of those that can be abolished, [15] which results in
leaving room for different opinions about the categories of rules
to which this permission can be applied. In the Mahīśāsaka and
Sarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ s Mahākassapa depicts different opinions
monks might have on what the category "minor rules" refers to. [16]
In the Dharmaguptaka _Vinaya_, the (Haimavata?) * _Vinayamātṛkā_,
and the Theravāda _Vinaya_, once Ānanda has mentioned the
Buddha's permission to abolish the minor rules, [17] this leads to an

Franke 1908: 13 notes that [[DN16]] at DN II 154,24 continues by reporting that
the Buddha, about to pass away, asked the assembled monks if they had any
doubt or uncertainty about the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Saṅgha, or the path,
encouraging them to have it clarified now while he was still alive. Franke
notes that this would presumably have been an occasion for Ānanda to have
the scope of the expression "minor rules" clarified. A similar invitation to get
any doubts clarified can be found in the Sanskrit fragment parallel, Waldschmidt 1951: 390,21 (§42.2), as well as in [[DA2]] at T I 26b1, T 5 at T I 172c7
(here the doubts are only about the scriptures), T 6 at T I 188b4, and T 7 at T I
204c7 (which just mentions doubt in general, without further specifications).
Another point worth noting is that in the Theravāda _Vinaya_ Ānanda's mentioning of this permission by the Buddha occurs after his recitation of the discourses where, had he recited [[DN16]] in full, the monks would already have
been informed of the Buddha's injunction; a narrative inconsistency already

actual discussion among the assembled monks who propose
different interpretations of the scope of the expression "minor
rules". [18]

The Mahāsāṅghika _Vinaya_ reports such a discussion regarding
the scope of the minor rules to be abolished taking place after the
completion of the first _saṅgīti_ . This discussion involves a group
of a thousand monks who had not participated in the gathering.
After recording a range of different opinions regarding which
rules should be abolished, comparable to the differences reported
in the other _Vinaya_ s, the Mahāsāṅghika _Vinaya_ continues with a
radical suggestion voiced by the infamous group of six monks.
This group of six monks is a recurrent trope in _Vinaya_ literature,
responsible for all kinds of mischief. According to the Mahāsāṅghika _Vinaya_, the group of six made the following suggestion:

noted by de La Vallée Poussin 1976: 14. This problem does not hold for the
Dharmaguptaka _Vinaya_, as in its account Ānanda's recitation of the discourses
takes place only afterwards. The * _Vinayamātṛkā_ has the same temporal sequence as the Theravāda _Vinaya_, in that here the recitation of the discourses
takes place before Ānanda mentions the Buddha's permission to abolish the
minor rules. This does not result in the same degree of inner inconsistency as
in the Theravāda _Vinaya_, however, since in the * _Vinayamātṛkā_ the recitation
of the discourses is not done by Ānanda, but rather involves the whole assembly of monks and Ānanda's role is only to be interrogated in case something
has been forgotten; cf. T 1463 at T XXIV 818a12. Since his mentioning of the
Buddha's permission occurs right after the recitation of the texts has been
completed, it falls naturally within the role assigned to him in the account of
the first _saṅgīti_ in the * _Vinayamātṛkā_ to mention what has not been recalled
by the other assembled monks.
18 Different views on the scope of the minor rules can also be found in later texts of

the Pāli tradition: Mil 144,4 takes the expression to refer just to the _dukkaṭa_ type
of offence, whereas Mp II 348,14 considers all rules except for the four _pārā_  _jika_ s to be minor rules. Vism 11,34 correlates the minor rules with the rules of
behaviour, _ābhisamācārika sīla_, and then indicates that the rules of behaviour
correspond to regulations found in the _Khandhaka_ s of the _Vinaya_ .

Elders, if the Blessed One were alive he would abolish all

[rules] completely. [19]


The group of six comes up in the Mahāsāṅghika _Vinaya_ again
in relation to the minor rules. During the lifetime of the Buddha,
they reportedly objected to the inclusion of the minor rules in the
recitation of the monastic code of rules. [20] A similar objection by
the group of six against the recitation of the minor rules is reported in a range of other _Vinaya_ s. [21] Perhaps this episode led to
an association of the group of six with the motif of the minor
rules in the first _saṅgīti_ account as found in the Mahāsāṅghika
_Vinaya_ .

Even leaving aside this blatant suggestion found in the Mahāsāṅghika _Vinaya_ only, a lack of agreement among the monks concerning the scope of the minor rules to be abolished is not a light
matter. It involves different conceptions of the scope of the code
of monastic rules, _pātimokkha_ / _prātimokṣa_, that is to serve as the
foundation for the monastic community.

had found a place in the code of the Pātimokkha".

recital, he replied that he preferred to remember the Dharma and
_Vinaya_ in the way he had heard them himself. [22] [4]

The Dharmaguptaka _Vinaya_, the (Haimavata?) * _Vinayamātṛ_  _kā_, and the Mahīśāsaka _Vinaya_ report that Purāṇa was not aware

the rules that are to be followed after the Buddha's demise,
thereby endangering the harmonious continuity of the Buddhist
monastic tradition. [24]


_**Saṅgīti**_ **and Communal Harmony**

According to different _Vinaya_ s, at the suggestion of Mahākassapa the decision was taken by the assembled participants of the
first _saṅgīti_ that no rule should be abolished and no new rule be
promulgated. When evaluated in its narrative context, this decision is only natural. A central concern behind the performance of

to one way of behaviour (the Vinaya)." As noted by Ñāṇatusita 2014: xxxviii,
"the most important purpose of the fortnightly Pātimokkha recitation is assuring the unity of the Saṅgha."

a _saṅgīti_ is to affirm communal harmony. [25] The same concern
finds explicit expression in the concluding section of the different
codes of the monastic rules, which enjoins that all of the assembled monastics should train in concord in these rules, without dispute. [26] Thus a disagreement about the scope of the code of the
monastic rules, to be recited every observance day ( _uposatha_ ) by
the members of a monastic community in affirmation of their
agreement to train in these rules, needs to be avoided at all costs.
How could monastics be expected to recite in harmony if they did
not first of all agree on the scope of what was to be recited? Discord in this respect carries with it the potential of _saṅghabheda_, a
schism in the monastic community. This is the exact opposite of
what the first _saṅgīti_ set out to achieve.

The _Sāmagāma-sutta_ and its _Madhyama-āgama_ parallel report
that, after the leader of the Jains had passed away, his monks began to quarrel among each other. The loss of communal harmony
then caused the lay followers to become dissatisfied. The relevant

one's allegiance to the organisation which was represented by the Dhamma
and the Vinaya." Collins 1998: 447 summarizes the general spirit of early
Buddhist monastic administration and law in the following way: "a community organizing its affairs by uncoerced vote rather than authoritarian _fiat_, and
achieving (in aspiration, at least) a state of unanimous harmony".

Not long after his death the disciples of the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta had broken up into factions and there was no communal

these [monastic] disciples of the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta. [27]


Quarrel among the monastic community leading to dissatisfaction among the lay followers is a dire prospect for Jain as well as
Buddhist monastics. Their mendicant lifestyle makes both monastic traditions rather sensitive to dissatisfaction among their respective lay followers and the potential loss of their support. [28]

very society he had opted out of." The ability of the laity to assert their influence results in particular, in the words of Findly 2002: 13, from "the renunciant being normally prohibited from using the cooking fire and from storing
edibles, and being thus dependent on a daily round of door-to-door petitioning
to procure his serving of cooked food". Findly 2002: 18 adds that "this dependence on resources by the Buddhist renunciant is, in this way, curious: in spite
of the fact that they are enjoined to live as islands unto themselves, as refuges
unto themselves … they do indeed need others; they need donors to give them,
on a continual basis, the material means" they require, resulting in "the need
for the petitioner to consider and maintain the goodwill of the donor"; cf. also,

In order to prevent communal disharmony and its dire repercussions, the assembled participants of the first _saṅgīti_ would have
found themselves forced to find a solution enabling them to establish communal concord on the basis of common adherence to the
same set of rules. In fact the decision not to abolish any existing
rule and not to allow for new rules to be promulgated just follows
a precedent set according to the _Mahāparinibbāna-sutta_ by the
Buddha himself. The passage in question reports that one of several principles preventing decline set forth by him was precisely
that existing rules should not be abolished and new rules should
not be established. [29] [5]

The Sarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ account of the first _saṅgīti_ explicitly
draws attention to this parallelism. According to its report, when
Mahākassapa proposed that it would be best not to abolish any of
the rules and not to promulgate new rules, he explicitly referred to
the Buddha's teaching of such a way of proceeding as one of seven
principles to prevent the decline of the monastic community. [30]

relling Jains; they also present a contrast to this decision. This contrast emerges with the Buddha's reaction to the report of the quarrel
among the Jains. This reaction emphasizes the _bodhipakkhiyā dham_ _mā_ as the core of the teaching, concord regarding which will prevent the arising of quarrel in the Buddhist community. [31] These are:

  - the four establishments of mindfulness ( _satipaṭṭhāna_ ),

  - the four right efforts ( _sammappadhāna_ ),

  - the four bases for supernormal ability ( _iddhipāda_ ),

  - the five faculties ( _indriya_ ),

  - the five powers ( _bala_ ),

  - the seven factors of awakening ( _bojjhaṅga_ ),

  - the noble eightfold path ( _ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo_ ).
The _Pāsādika-sutta_ and its Chinese _Dīrgha-āgama_ parallel
recommend concord regarding this set of qualities and practices
conducive to awakening as what will prevent a loss of communal
harmony after the Buddha’s demise. [32] The same concern to maintain communal harmony in contrast to the quarrelling Jains informs
the _Saṅgīti-sutta_ and its parallels. [33] The exposition given in this discourse is predominantly about aspects of the teaching, the Dharma; matters of monastic rule and conduct only play a minor role.

In this way the _Sāmagāma-sutta_, the _Pāsādika-sutta_, and the
_Saṅgīti-sutta_, together with their parallels, present a broader vision
of the foundation for concord, which covers various practices that
purify the mind. Although these of course require establishing a

basis in morality, they are not concerned with adherence to moral
conduct alone. [34]

A discourse in the _Aṅguttara-nikāya_ and its _Saṃyukta-āgama_
parallel report that a monk in front of the Buddha declared his inability to train in the whole set of regulations covered in the monastic code of rules. [35] According to the Buddha's reply, the monk
should just dedicate himself to the three trainings in higher virtue,
the higher mind, and higher wisdom.

This pragmatic reply is significant for appreciating the importance given to the rules in early Buddhist thought. The importance
of virtue, _sīla_, has its proper place as the first of the three trainings, building a foundation for the higher mind and higher wisdom. Nevertheless, observance of the rules is clearly seen as subordinate to the overarching aim of cultivating the higher mind and
higher wisdom, that is, tranquillity and insight. [36] [6]

34 Dhirasekera 1982/2007: 227 highlights "the relatively secondary importance

which the Buddha attached to discipline in its mere outward form in contrast
to the more fundamental teachings of the doctrine and their practice in the
religious life"; cf. also Guruge 1970: 11.
35 Whereas [[AN5.70]] at AN I 230,17 speaks of over hundred and fifty rules, per
haps reflecting an early count of the Theravāda _pātimokkha_ still in evolution,
its parallel [[SA829]] at T II 212c11 instead mentions two hundred and fifty rules;
cf. also, e.g., Dutt 1924/1996: 75f, Law 1933: 21, Bhagvat 1939: 64, Pachow
1955: 8f, Misra 1972: 33, and Dhirasekera 1982/2007: 145. A reference to a
version of this discourse preserved in a Sanskrit fragment _uddāna_ can be found
in Pischel 1904: 1139 (IIIa.1).
36 In this context it may also be worthwhile to note a recurrent pattern emerging

from a comparative study of the _Majjhima-nikāya_ in the light of its parallels,
where the Pāli discourses have an apparent predilection for commending the
seeing of fear in even the slightest fault when training in the precepts, _aṇumattesu_
_vajjesu bhayadassāvī, samādāya sikkhassu sikkhāpadesu_, whereas their _Madhya_  _ma-āgama_ parallels rather place emphasis on bodily, verbal, and mental purity;
cf. Anālayo 2011b: 718. This seems to reflect slightly different positions regarding the question of whether the rules are means to an end or the end in itself.


_Saṅgīti_ (CV XI)  213


A set of three discourses in the _Aṅguttara-nikāya_ and their
respective parallels in the _Saṃyukta-āgama_ even go so far as to
indicate that someone who has fulfilled the higher training in
virtue could still commit breaches of the minor rules; in fact the
same holds even for someone who has fulfilled the training in the
higher mind. [37]

The danger of mistaking the means of moral conduct for the
goal comes up for explicit comment in the _Mahāsāropama-sutta_
and its _Ekottarika-āgama_ parallel. According to both versions, to
mistake accomplishment in virtue, _sīla_, as the goal would be comparable to a person who mistakes the bark or else the leaves of a
tree for its heartwood. [38] Having taken only the bark or the leaves
from the tree, this person will be unable to carry out the task to be
accomplished with the help of heartwood.

Needless to say, the main task to be accomplished from the normative viewpoint of early Buddhism is awakening. For progress to
awakening a discourse in the _Udāna_ then recommends avoiding the
two extremes of either taking rules and observances to be the essence of the holy life or else seeing no fault in sensuality. [39] Reach

[[AN5.73]] at AN I 233,38, and [[AN3.87]] at AN I 234,19 go a step further, since
according to them a breach of the minor rules would be possible even for someone who has fulfilled the training in the higher virtue, the higher mind, and
higher wisdom, i.e., for an arahant.
38 [[MN29]] at MN I 193,21 compares this to the bark of the tree; the parallel [[EA43.4]]

ing the first level of awakening in turn entails precisely overcoming
the fetter of dogmatic adherence to rules and observances. [40]


**Mahākassapa and Ānanda at the First** _**Saṅgīti**_

Whereas the emphasis in the above discourses is on concord
regarding the liberating teachings as a whole, with the first _saṅgīti_
an increasing emphasis on firm adherence to the rules sets in. This
exemplifies a theme that runs through the entire _saṅgīti_ account,
particularly evident in the contrast set between Mahākassapa and
Ānanda. In the early discourses the former brahmin Mahākassapa
stands out as a devoted adherent to ascetic conduct and therefore
naturally functions as an emblem of an attitude that gives particular importance to aspects of moral conduct. [41]

A discourse in the _Samyutta-nikāya_ and its parallels showcase
Mahākassapa as being so devoted to his ascetic conduct that he is
unwilling to give it up even on being explicitly invited by the Buddha to do so. [42] This stands in a telling contrast to the _Mahāsakulu_ _dāyi-sutta_ and its parallel, which report the Buddha making the
explicit point that he was considerably less ascetic in his conduct
than some of his disciples. [43]

he embodies take precedence over Ānanda who, in spite of being

the Buddha's personal attendant who had memorized the teachings,
finds himself being demoted and criticized in various ways. The _Vi_ _naya_ accounts of the first _saṅgīti_ report that Mahākassapa at first
did not even include Ānanda in the gathering. According to a parallel to the _Mahāparinibbāna-sutta_, Mahākassapa explained:


Ānanda is [like] a lay person. I am afraid that, being with
covetousness in his mind, he will not recite the discourses
completely. [44]


By comparing Ānanda to a lay person, he is implicitly presented as not living up to the ideal of a real monk as conceived by
the participants of the first _saṅgīti_, and this in turn puts into question his potential contribution to the first _saṅgīti_ by reciting the
discourses. [7] According to the Mahāsāṅghika _Vinaya_, in reply to
the suggestion by other monks to let Ānanda be part of the assembly, Mahākassapa refused:


No! A person in training like him entering among the community of those powerful and virtuous ones who are beyond
training is like letting a jackal enter among a pride of lions. [45]


Although not necessarily in such stark terms, the different
_Vinaya_ accounts of the first _saṅgīti_ agree in drawing a pronounced
contrast between these two disciples. This contrast could reflect
an actual conflict between two contending factions in the monastic community after the Buddha's decease, with the more ascetically inclined faction emerging as the winning party in the accounts of the first _saṅgīti_ . [46]

The shift in attitude that emerges out of this contrast concords
with the agenda of the first _saṅgīti_, reportedly convened by Mahākassapa to ensure adherence to _Vinaya_ rules and regulations. This
in turn forms part of an attempt to shore up institutional authority
and achieve maximum acceptability in the eyes of public opinion,
in order to safeguard the continuity of support for the monastic
community.


**The Legacy of the** _**Saṅgīti**_ **and Theravāda Monasticism**

The decision to curtail the possibility of any adaptation of the
rules not only reflects a shift of perspective by foregrounding monastic discipline over other aspects of the Buddha's teaching, it
also involves to some degree a shift of perspective in relation to
these very rules. According to a basic pattern evident in the different _Vinaya_ s, the Buddha is on record for promulgating rules only
in reply to a particular problem that has arisen. [47] Often enough
rules given in order to address a particular issue then turn out to
be insufficient to settle the matter at hand, whereupon the Buddha
is shown to amend them by changing their formulation or making
additional stipulations. In short, the _Vinaya_ narratives on the promulgation of rules present these as _ad hoc_ regulations laid down in
response to specific situations, always open to amendments if the
situation should require this.

The in itself natural decision taken at the first _saṅgīti_ to consider these _ad hoc_ regulations to be unalterable law that no longer

and T 1425 at T XXII 227c2 (cf. also T 2121 at T LIII 70a11). In the words of
von Hinüber 1995: 7, "rules are prescribed only after an offence has been committed. Thus rules are derived from experience and based on the practical need
to avoid certain forms of behavior in future. This means at the same time that
the cause for a rule is always due to the wrong behavior of a certain person,
and consequently there is no [pre-]existent system of Buddhist law."


_Saṅgīti_ (CV XI)  217


admits of any change moves Buddhist law closer to ancient
Indian brahminical attitudes towards law as something invested
with a timeless status. [48] In this way the first _saṅgīti_ marks the
onset of an attitude that has its basis in ritualistic tendencies
prevalent in the ancient Indian setting, whereby rules originally
meant to support the monastic life acquire such importance that
they become the timeless essence of the monastic life.

The decision reportedly taken at the first _saṅgīti_ has had considerable impact on the implementation of _Vinaya_ rules and their
observance in the Theravāda tradition in particular, where strict
adherence to the rules in the way these are found in the Pāli _Vinaya_
has become a core element of normative monastic identity. [49]

49 Tilakaratne 2005: 245 sees the first _saṅgīti_ 's decision to disallow any change

of the rules as expressing attitudes that "seem to have had tremendous influence in determining the subsequent history", representing "the formal beginning of the tradition that subsequently came to be known as" Theravāda. Tilakaratne 2005: 252f notes that for the Theravāda monastic tradition "strict adherence to Vinaya has been seen as its hallmark … [the] decision not to abolish any of the rules prescribed by the Buddha and not to formulate any new
rules crystallizes this attitude." Tilakaratne 2005: 254 concludes that "the end
result of this emphasis was a monastic organization which lay more emphasis
on the letter than on the spirit of the Vinaya."

The _Dīpavaṃsa_ (4.6) defines the expression _theravāda_ as a referent to the sayings that were collected by the elders at the first
_saṅgīti_ :


The collection of the teaching and the discipline [was made]
by the five hundred elders, this collection made by the elders
is called _theravāda_ . [50] [8]

A similar definition can be found in the _Mahāvaṃsa_ (3.40). [51]
In other words, for Theravāda monastics the Pāli _Vinaya_, held to
have been recited in this form at the first _saṅgīti_, forms the core
of their monastic identity, and this often to such an extent that it
can overshadow the other component of the definition of _thera_ _vāda_ in the _Dīpavaṃsa_, which is the Dhamma. Unsurprisingly
this sense of monastic identity that foregrounds the _Vinaya_ comes
in close association with the decision enshrined in the first _saṅ_ _gīti_ 's account to keep the rules unaltered and not permit any
change or amendment. [52] The resultant attitude in traditional Theravāda monastic circles finds a succinct summarisation in a statement reportedly made by the venerable Ajāhn Buddhadāsa at the
sixth _saṅgīti_ in Burma in 1956. He explains that Theravāda monastics are

even in its least form … we have no warrant of addition in
such a manner that would make Buddhism develop according

this very cowardice, Theravada is still remaining in its pristine
form of the original doctrine. May we be in cowardice in this
way forever. [53]


**Conclusion**

The convening of the first _saṅgīti_ is presented as being motivated by the perceived need to ensure strict adherence to the rules
promulgated by the Buddha. Faced by the permission to abrogate
the minor rules, the monks assembled at the first _saṅgīti_ reportedly
find themselves unable to determine which rules this permission
refers to. In view of the central purpose of the first _saṅgīti_ to ensure communal harmony and avoid discord in the monastic community, it seems almost inevitable that the decision taken in such
a situation should be to avoid any change and pledge adherence to
the code of rules as received without allowing any alteration
whatsoever.

Although in itself a natural development, this decision involves a change of attitude towards what at the outset were regulations amenable to adjustment and modification should this be
required. The resultant legal conservatism particularly evident in
traditional monastic Theravāda circles needs to be understood in
the light of its historical roots as the final result of what originally
appears to have been predominantly an attempt to maintain
communal harmony after the demise of the Buddha.

## **Bhikkhunī Ordination**

**Introduction**

In this chapter I examine the legal dimensions of the contemporary revival of _bhikkhunī_ ordination. [1] My main focus is on the state
of affairs in the Theravāda tradition, although at times I also refer to
the situation in the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition for comparison.

I begin with the Theravāda sense of identity and the perceived
threat of the Mahāyāna tradition(s). Then I turn to the transmission
of _bhikkhunī_ ordination to Sri Lanka and China, as a backdrop for
evaluating the option of "dual ordination", where female candidates
receive ordination from Theravāda monks in collaboration with
Dharmaguptaka nuns. Then I study the alternative option of "single
ordination" by receiving ordination from Theravāda monks only. In
the final part of the chapter I turn to the present-day situation of
female monastics in Theravāda countries.

Before getting into the actual topic, I need to comment on the
methodological background for my discussion, in particular on
different ways in which _Vinaya_ can be read. Here two modes of
reading _Vinaya_ are of particular relevance. One is what I would call
a "legal" reading, the other is a "historical-critical" reading. A legal
reading attempts to understand legal implications from the viewpoint of tradition; a historical-critical reading attempts to reconstruct historical developments through comparative study. Both
ways of reading have their place and value, depending on the circumstances and particular aim of one's reading of a _Vinaya_ text.

For someone ordained within the Theravāda tradition, the Pāli
_Vinaya_ is the central law book on which the observance of the

monastic rules is based. [2] The rules in the way they are set forth in
the Theravāda _Vinaya_ are binding on anyone taking ordination in
the Theravāda tradition; the rules in other _Vinaya_ traditions are
not. For legal purposes, the appropriate reading is therefore a
legal reading of the descriptions given and the rules pronounced
in the Theravāda _Vinaya_, together with their understanding by
later Theravāda tradition. Other _Vinaya_ s are not of direct relevance, as they do not have legal implications for a monastic of the
Theravāda tradition.

The situation is different, however, when one aims at reconstructing an early, perhaps the earliest possible, account of what
happened on the ground. This requires a historical-critical mode
of reading, where the relevant portion of the Theravāda _Vinaya_
needs to be studied in comparison with other _Vinaya_ traditions.

In the present chapter I will be for the most part examining the
legal question, consequently my discussion will be based on the
description given in the Theravāda _Vinaya_, irrespective of the
historical likelihood or otherwise of its indications. Any suggestion I make about how the Buddha acted or what he intended is
therefore not part of an attempted historical reconstruction, but
rather part of the construction of a coherent narrative based on the
indications found in the Theravāda _Vinaya_, serving as a background for a legal reading of this particular monastic code and its
bearing on the living Theravāda tradition(s).

For legal purposes affecting present-day Theravāda monastics,
the Pāli _Vinaya_ in the form it has been handed down is the central
frame of reference, not whatever one believes really happened in
ancient India two and a half millennia ago.

An example to illustrate this point is the suggestion by Schlingloff (1963) that at times, instead of the rule being formulated in

response to a certain event, the narrative event appears to have
been formulated in response to the rule. That is, a particular expression in the rule, on being no longer fully understood, seems to
have provided the starting point for the creation of the narrative
plot that now introduces the rule in the Pāli _Vinaya_ .

This finding does not affect the legal relevance of the narrative
within which the rule is embedded. The putting into practice of
this rule by a Theravāda monastic will still have to be guided by
the narrative context within which the rule is now found in the
Theravāda _Vinaya_ .


**The Theravāda Sense of Identity**

By way of setting a background for my discussion of the legal
aspects of the revival of the _bhikkhunī_ order, in what follows I
begin with the attitude towards _Vinaya_ rules that is characteristic
of traditional Theravāda monastics. [3] I believe this is a necessary
basis for properly understanding the problems involved.

As mentioned in the previous chapter, in the Sri Lankan chronicle _Dīpavaṃsa_ (4.6) the term _theravāda_ designates the texts that
according to the traditional account were collected by the elders at
the first communal recitation ( _saṅgīti_ ) at Rājagaha. [4] As also discussed in the last chapter, the story of the convening of the first
_saṅgīti_ as motivated by the perceived need to ensure strict adherence to the rules has resulted in an attitude of pronounced legal
conservatism in traditional Theravāda monastic circles.

The same term Theravāda in the _Dīpavaṃsa_ and in the commentary on the _Kathāvatthu_ then refers to the Sri Lankan school
that has preserved the Pāli version of these sayings collected at

Theravāda tradition or that all monastics ordained in this tradition subscribe to
them.

the first communal recitation, which both works set in opposition
to other Buddhist schools in India. [5]

This reflects central aspects of the Theravāda sense of identity,
namely the Pāli canon as its sacred literature and Pāli as its ceremonial language. [6] The rules and regulations given in the _Vinaya_ part
of the Pāli canon are thus naturally seen by monastic members of
the Theravāda tradition as being of crucial importance. The commentary on the _Vinaya_ declares that one's own opinion or even
indications given in the commentarial tradition itself should never
override the canonical presentation in the _Vinaya_ . [7] In short, the Pāli
_Vinaya_ is the central reference point for Theravāda monasticism.

The degree to which adherence to the regulations in the Pāli
_Vinaya_ are perceived as crucial can be illustrated with the example of the ruling that a _bhikkhu_ is permitted to have only three
robes. [8] These are the two relatively long outer robes ( _uttarāsaṅga_
and _saṅghāti_ ), one of which is of double-layer cloth and thus considerably warmer than the other, and the shorter inner garment
( _antaravāsaka_ ). Due to the differences in size between these three
robes, [9] it becomes inconvenient when one robe has just been

Buddhism are the use of Pali as its main sacred language and dependence on

Skilling 2009: 64 explains that "the preservation, transmission, and study of
the Pali canon and the use of Pāli as a liturgical language – by monastics and
laity – is one distinctive and unifying feature of the Theravādin lineages."

much shorter; cf. also Schlingloff 1963: 544f.

washed and is still wet. The situation would be much easier if one
were not restricted to these three robes and could have extra robes
that can be worn while one of the three is left somewhere to dry.

The Theravāda approach in such a situation is not to amend
the rule itself. Instead, a way of solving the situation is found
within the parameters of keeping to the letter of the rule. This is
done by giving another name altogether to an additional robe,
calling it a "requisite cloth" ( _parikkhāracoḷa_ ) when formally taking possession of it. For requisite cloths no number limitations
apply, [10] hence in this way one can have more than the traditionally allowed three robes without breaking the rule. This way of
finding a solution is characteristic of the way traditional Theravādin monastics attempt to deal with legal matters.

Another example illustrating the tension between legal strictness and present-day exigencies would be the restriction that a
_bhikkhu_ should not accept gold and silver. [11] This is followed by
another two rules that regulate against monetary exchange and
engaging in barter. [12] In the original setting in ancient India such
restrictions would have been a natural way of demarcating a life
of renunciation. In modern times, however, rules that prohibit the
use or possession of money, as well as engaging in any type of
financial transaction, are not easily observed. Perhaps precisely
because of the challenges involved, abstention from the use of
money has become a marker of strict Theravāda monasticism.

12 According to Vin III 239,28 and 241,27, confession and forfeiture similarly ob
tain in the case of engaging in various kinds of monetary exchange or when
buying and selling.


226  _Vinaya_ Studies


Maintaining this type of conduct is further complicated by the
commentarial exegesis, which considers it problematic even when
a monastic just makes use of monastery items that have been procured in violation of these rules by other _bhikkhu_ s. [13] This becomes a problem for strict Theravāda _bhikkhu_ s who travel, since
staying in other monasteries one runs the risk of partaking of monastic items that have been procured in an improper manner. For
the visiting _bhikkhu_ it is hardly possible to ascertain this beforehand. The alternative of staying with lay supporters is also not
ideal, since in such a case the _bhikkhu_ risks infringement of other
regulations. [14]

The solution to this problem among strict Theravāda _bhikkhu_ s
in modern times is to stay, whenever possible, in Mahāyāna monasteries. Monks in Mahāyāna monasteries are ordained in different _Vinaya_ traditions. In the case of Chinese, Korean, or Vietnamese monastics this is the Dharmaguptaka tradition. In the case of
Tibetan monastics this is the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition. From a
strictly legal perspective, these individuals do not count as monastics within a Theravāda _Vinaya_ framework. Thus if they should
have handled money when acquiring monastery items, this would
not pose a problem for the visiting Theravāda _bhikkhu_ .

This solution not only exemplifies the legalist attitude in some
traditional Theravāda monastic circles, [15] but also provides the important indication that being part of a particular _Vinaya_ tradition

14 Vin IV 16,31 and 19,31 prevent a _bhikkhu_ from lying down in the company of

those who have not received higher ordination for more than three nights in a
dwelling place (not necessarily only in the same room), and from lying down
even once in the company of a woman. Vin IV 96,14 and 97,23 regulate against
a _bhikkhu_ just sitting down in the sole company of a woman.

_Bhikkhunī_ Ordination  227


makes one's acts legally valid within that tradition, but not necessarily in relation to those ordained in a different _Vinaya_ tradition.

For the question of reviving the _bhikkhunī_ order in the Theravāda tradition this attitude adopted by traditional Theravāda
monastics has important ramifications. It should be clear that to
propose that the _Vinaya_ rules be better amended so as to allow a
revival of _bhikkhunī_ ordination is unacceptable from a traditional
viewpoint. Such a suggestion misses out on a central aspect of
Theravāda identity, namely the strict adherence to the Pāli canon
and in particular to the regulations in the way these have been
preserved in the Pāli _Vinaya_ . The Pāli commentaries report that at
the first communal recitation at Rājagaha the _bhikkhu_ s decided to
recite the _Vinaya_ first, since they felt that the _Vinaya_ is what gives
life force to the Buddha's dispensation, whose endurance is
ensured as long as the _Vinaya_ endures. [16]

The proposal to adjust the rules not only misses out on a central component of the Theravāda sense of identity, it also suggests
something that, within the traditional framework, is not possible.
As discussed in the previous chapter, the _Mahāparinibbāna-sutta_
reports the Buddha highlighting a set of conditions that will ensure the prosperity of his disciples. According to one of these
conditions, the _bhikkhu_ s should not authorize what has not been
authorized and should not abrogate what has been authorized. [17]
As mentioned above, this attitude finds full endorsement in the
narrative of the first _saṅgīti_ and the decision not to abolish the
minor rules. This implies that the community of _bhikkhu_ s does
not have the right

to change the _vinaya_, but has to confine itself to practise
according to it. It can be compared to policemen who have the
duty to follow the law but not the right to change it. [18]


Thus it is not particularly meaningful to argue for membership
in the Theravāda tradition and at the same time request changes
that members of this tradition will view as directly opposed to the


――――――
18 Watchara Ngamcitcaroen, quoted in Seeger 2010b: 90. According to Sobisch

2010: 243, however, in legal matters like giving higher ordination "the fact
that the saṅgha has autonomy and the authority to decide the matter is probably unchallenged." As far as I can see he bases himself on two points: 1) The
suggestion by Huxley 1996: 157 that the motion reported at Vin II 288,23 not
to implement the Buddha's permission to abrogate the minor rules implies in
principle "that the _saṅgha_ has the power to change the rules, though they are
not in fact exercising it. Thus it shifts the grundnorm from the Buddha to the
First Council." As discussed in the previous chapter, the point of the tale is
rather that the monks were unable to come to an agreement about what rules
this permission should be applied to and that Mahākassapa voiced apprehension about the reaction of the laity on hearing of a change of the rules. This
then led to the decision not to implement the explicit permission given by the
Buddha. The episode as a whole does not involve a basic shift that invests the
_saṅgha_ with the legal authority earlier held by the Buddha. Much rather it
emphasizes the need to adhere closely to the ruling believed to have been given
by the Buddha, so much so that uncertainty about its precise implications makes
it preferable to avoid taking any action. 2) The second point seems to be the assumption by Sobisch 2010: 239 and 241 that, given that "it is nowhere mentioned that earlier full ordinations of monks were invalidated through the introduction of new, additional rules regarding the process of ordination … the
new contents of the procedure are not essential for the materialization of the
vow [i.e., of the higher ordination], because if that were the case, the earlier
procedures could not have materialized a valid vow." It seems to me that this
line of reasoning does not fully take into account a basic legal principle in the
_Vinaya_, according to which a new regulation applies only to cases that arise
after its promulgation, not to what happened before the rule in question came
into being. The earlier ordinations remained valid simply because they were
carried out according to the rules that had been legally binding at that time.


_Bhikkhunī_ Ordination  229


very way the Theravāda traditions ensure their continuity. Such a
suggestion not only fails to understand basic principles of the Theravāda tradition, it even actively foments apprehensions, since in
the eyes of traditional Theravādins this easily appears to be an
attempt to erode the very principle that traditionalists consider as
vital for the survival of the tradition _qua_ the _sāsana_ . [19]

Here it also needs to be kept in mind that the issue in question
is not simply one of gender equality. Considerations of human
rights and an awareness of the detrimental effects of discrimination are of course important values in the modern day, [20] but from
the viewpoint of tradition these are not decisive criteria in relation
to the question of membership in the Theravāda monastic traditions. That is, the problem is not just that male chauvinists want
to keep women in an inferior position. [21] Much of the problem is
rather the apprehension that the legal principles, which form the
basis for the sense of identity of the Theravāda monastic traditions, are perceived as being jeopardized.

By way of illustration, I would like to turn briefly to the comparable case of the Tibetan Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition, where in

the problem of discrimination in particular Goodwin 2012.
21 Cf., e.g, Sobisch 2010: 242, who comments on opposition to the revival of

_bhikkhunī_ ordination that the "arguments and sentiments reveal the actual motivation of the denial, namely to locate fitting female activities in social work
(instead of asceticism and renunciation), family life, and providing of alms for
the monks. Instead, women dare to become an economic threat to the monks
as eligible receivers of alms!" If this were indeed the main motivation, one
would expect those who oppose the revival of _bhikkhunī_ ordination to be at
the same time also opposed to the existence of _thila shin_ s, _dasasil mātā_ s, and
Thai _mae chi_ s, which is not the case.


230  _Vinaya_ Studies


recent times women have also received higher ordination from
Chinese _bhikṣuṇī_ s, yet acceptance from their own tradition has
remained controversial. At the conclusion of a conference held in
2007 at Hamburg University on this issue, the Dalai Lama gave
permission to these _bhikṣuṇī_ s to perform the monastic rituals based
on the Dharmaguptaka code of rules, translated into Tibetan. [22]

Although on the surface this permission appears to accommodate the aspirations of these women, in terms of monastic reality
it actually sets them apart from the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition of
which they wish to be part. [23] In fact to my knowledge this permission has so far not been put into practice. The point I intend to
make is that the issue at stake is not just the bare fact that a
woman follower of the Tibetan tradition wishes to take higher
ordination. The problem rather lies with her integration into the
Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition.

Applied to the present case, I doubt that Theravāda traditionalists would object to a woman who wants to become a _bhikṣuṇī_ by
taking the Chinese Dharmaguptaka ordination and subsequently
wears their style of robes and participates in their monastic rituals.
Traditionalists would just not recognize her as a Theravāda _bhik_ _khunī_ .

In other words, the problem is not merely that a Theravāda
woman wants to receive higher ordination. The question is rather

Tibetan-speaking community, but on the other hand draws a clear line between
the (Tibetan) Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition and the Dharmaguptaka tradition. It
does not allow women to enter the Mūlasarvāstivāda monastic organization,
but sets them apart. It can therefore be doubted whether this proposal is
acceptable to the Buddhist women who plead for an institutionally equal
position within the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition."


_Bhikkhunī_ Ordination  231


whether, on being ordained in the Dharmaguptaka tradition, she can
be recognized as a member of the Theravāda monastic community.

This is a matter that needs to be resolved within the parameters
of the Theravāda tradition, in particular from the viewpoint of the
Pāli _Vinaya_ . Although calls for gender equality can have an influence in the case of legal ambiguity, they are in themselves not
decisive, since acceptance in the Theravāda tradition has to be
based on the legal principles recognized in this tradition.

Therefore, if the rules in the Theravāda _Vinaya_ render a revival of the _bhikkhunī_ order legally impossible, then such a revival stands little chance of meeting with approval by the traditionalists. At the same time, however, as the example of the
three robes has shown, if a revival can be brought about without
direct infringement of the rules, then members of the tradition
also have less of a basis for refusing to accept that the _bhikkhunī_
order has been resurrected.


**The Mahāyāna Threat**

A revival of the Theravāda _bhikkhunī_ order through the standard modus of dual ordination would require the cooperation of
_bhikṣuṇī_ s from the Dharmaguptaka tradition. The fact that such
_bhikṣuṇī_ s are followers of the Mahāyāna is one of the objections
raised against accepting the validity of this ordination lineage.

Apprehensions towards the Mahāyāna can be illustrated with
the example of the sense of identity of the Theravāda tradition in
Sri Lanka in particular as having defended itself against Mahāyāna intrusions throughout much of its early history.

For an appreciation of such apprehensions, in what follows I
present some extracts from the _Nikāya-saṅgraha_ . [24] This work,

compiled in the fourteenth century by the head of the monastic
community, the _saṅgharāja_ of Sri Lanka, provides a history of the
development of Buddhism from its origin in India to Sri Lanka.
The _saṅgharāja_ explains that he composed "this religious history
… for the purpose of showing how religion prospers". [25]

The _Nikāya-saṅgraha_ records that repeatedly "the Vaitulya
doctrines [i.e., the Mahāyāna teachings] were brought to Laṇká
(sic) … and were burnt to ashes by sincere Buddhist kings", [26] reporting that at one point a Sri Lankan king even went so far as to
be "placing guards round the coast to prevent the arrival of false
priests" in Sri Lanka who might spread such doctrines, [27] but
nevertheless these doctrines "were clandestinely observed as a
secret cult … [and] kept up by the foolish and the ignorant". A
work called _Nīlapaṭadarśana_ was also kept in circulation. It is the
_saṅgharāja_ 's account of how this _Nīlapaṭadarśana_ came into
being during the first half of the sixth century that is of particular
interest for my present purpose. The story reads as follows: [28]


At that time a wicked priest of the Sammittiya Nikáya,
clever but impious, went to the house of a harlot at night, covering himself with a blue garment, and having slept there, returned at daybreak to the vihára. His pupils, noticing his attire,
asked him if that was a proper garment. Then, as many had
seen the garment he had on, he lauded it and explained its propriety. The priests who were his devoted followers gave up
their robes and donned blue garments. Then this man adopting
as the three incomparable gems in the three worlds, vivacious
harlots, enlivening drink, and the god of love, and worshipping

them, despised the other gems as if they were crystal stone,
and composed a work in _Grantha_ called Nílapaṭadarṣana (sic),
i.e., the exposition of the blue robe. Thus says that work:

A favouring damsel is a gem;
A gem is cheering wine.
A gem is Love. These gems I serve.
No crystal gems are mine.
When thus the Nílapaṭadarṣana began to be promulgated,
King Ṣríharsa (sic) sent for it and perused it.

"Fool, why not drink? Dost thou wish to go to hell? Spirit
mixed with a pinch of salt is scarce even in heaven!"

Noticing this incoherent stanza, and realizing that this in
sooth is no doctrine but a breach of religion which, if treated
with indifference by a ruler such as he was, would lead to the
ruin of Buddhism and to the damnation of many men, he determined to protect the religion of Buddha which is to endure
for 5,000 years. Pretending to be convinced, he sent for the
blue-robed brethren and their books, and having got them with
the books into a house, he made a fire-offering of house and
all. A few who escaped on that occasion, like a disease not
entirely stamped out, still continued to don the same garments.


When evaluating the above description, it needs to be kept in
mind that this story was recorded as a historical event by the chief
_bhikkhu_ of the Sri Lankan monastic community, the _saṅgharāja_ .
Thus it can safely be assumed that it would have been taken as an
accurate description of actual historical events by members of the
same tradition.

For a pious Theravāda Buddhist, this story is rather shocking.
The formal act of becoming a lay Buddhist involves taking refuge
in the three gems and committing oneself to the observance of the
five precepts, the last of which requires abstaining from intoxicat

ing drinks. This formal act of taking refuge and the five precepts
is repeated periodically on days of religious observance, usually
being administered by a Theravāda _bhikkhu_ to the lay followers.

The above passage involves an outrageous reinterpretation of
the three gems that are the object of taking refuge, which are the
Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṅgha. It presents indulgence in
liquor as being promoted by a monk from a non-Theravāda school,
who thus does the precise opposite of what a Theravāda _bhikkhu_
in the traditional setting is expected to do. This non-Theravāda
monk also differs from Theravāda _bhikkhu_ s by wearing robes entirely of a blue colour, [29] an expedient to cover up the fact that he
is not a true monk at all, as he frequents prostitutes. The narrative
context in which the story of his behaviour appears then gives the
impression that in some way he is associated with the Mahāyāna.

Although it can safely be assumed that modern-day Theravādins in Sri Lanka for the most part would not envision the Mahāyāna tradition in such a degenerate form, the fact that the tale from
the _Nikāya-saṅgraha_ is part of the 'historical' tradition would make
it unsurprising if an ordination carried out by _bhikṣuṇī_ s who are
followers of the Mahāyāna and wear grey-coloured robes is perceived with apprehensions.

Here it also needs to be kept in mind that Theravādins are not
necessarily aware of the fact that the Chinese monastic tradition
differs considerably from Buddhist clergy in Japan, where nowadays Mahāyāna priests can marry and do not necessarily abstain
from the consumption of alcohol. [30] From the viewpoint of Thera

vāda traditionalists, the revival of _bhikkhunī_ ordination is easily
seen as yet another Mahāyāna intrusion in line with what are believed to be historical antecedents, an intrusion that needs to be
repulsed at all costs for the sake of preserving the 'purity' of the
Theravāda tradition(s).

Now taking full ordination in the Mahāyāna traditions is usually followed by the formal taking of the bodhisattva vow, just as
ceremonies for going forth in the Theravāda traditions incorporate
an instruction on contemplation of the anatomical parts of the
body. [31] This does not mean, however, that the path of the bodhisattva or the developing of insight into the unattractive nature of
the body are invariably being practised by those so ordained, nor
does the actual undertaking of these practices require becoming a
monastic.

Mahāyāna is in fact a religious vocation, not a monastic ordination tradition. The decision to become a follower of the Mahāyāna can be taken by a monastic or a lay person alike. The Mahāyāna is thus not a monastic lineage itself and, contrary to popular
belief, it is also not the result of a schism in the monastic community. [32]

Besides, the formal decision to embark on the path to future
Buddhahood on its own does not make one a follower of the
Mahāyāna. The path of the bodhisattva has for a long time been a
recognized vocation in the Theravāda traditions, [33] and some re

nowned _bhikkhu_ s in Sri Lanka occupying high ecclesiastical positions, like the late Balangoda Ānanda Maitreya or the late Nauyane Ariyadhamma, are well known for having been practitioners
of the bodhisattva path.

In sum, the foregoing shows the background to apprehensions
that the revival of the _bhikkhunī_ ordination in some way results in
an intrusion of the Mahāyāna into the Theravāda traditions, independently of whether such apprehensions are justified. The persistence of such apprehensions seems to me to keep alive a deeper
sense of threat that stands in line with the general association of
the existence of _bhikkhunī_ s with the decline of the Dharma. By
seeing the revival of the _bhikkhunī_ order in line with a series of
Mahāyāna incursions that had to be repelled in order to maintain
the purity of the Theravāda lineage, the underlying sense of an
impending decline continues.

From having examined attitudes and apprehensions related to
the Theravāda sense of monastic identity, I now turn to a brief
history of the transmission of _bhikkhunī_ ordination.


**The Transmission of** _**Bhikkhunī**_ **Ordination to Sri Lanka**

According to the Sri Lankan chronicle _Dīpavaṃsa_, in the third
century BCE _bhikkhu_ Mahinda, the son of King Asoka, came to
Sri Lanka and was instrumental in the spread of Buddhism. The
Ceylonese chronicle _Dīpavaṃsa_ reports that the recently converted
king of Sri Lanka requested that Mahinda, the son of King Asoka,
confer ordination on Queen Anulā and her followers. Mahinda's
reply to this request takes the following form:


Great King, it is not allowable for a _bhikkhu_

_Bhikkhunī_ Ordination  237


to confer the going forth on a woman. [34]


Here the _Dīpavaṃsa_ seems to use the expression "going forth",
_pabbajjā_, as an umbrella term for the whole procedure of _bhikkhunī_
ordination. I will return to this passage in the _Dīpavaṃsa_ in more
detail below.

According to the fully fledged procedure, _bhikkhunī_ ordination
consists of three distinct stages:

  - the going forth properly so called by becoming a _sāmaṇerī_,

  - the training as a probationer, _sikkhamānā_,

  - the full ordination as a _bhikkhunī_ .
When coming to Sri Lanka, Mahinda had not been in the company of _bhikkhunī_ s, so in order to enable the queen and her following to go forth and receive full ordination a quorum of _bhik_ _khunī_ s had to be brought to Sri Lanka. Until their arrival, a separate residence was established for the queen and her following of
five hundred women, who all took the ten precepts. [35]

Thus the above statement by Mahinda is not a blanket statement that a _bhikkhu_ cannot confer the going forth on a woman at
all. Instead it reflects the circumstance that, at the time the king
made this request, a flourishing order of _bhikkhunī_ s was in existence back in India. Therefore the proper way to effect the transmission of _bhikkhunī_ ordination to Sri Lanka was to bring _bhik_

_khuno_ . Although in the Theravāda _Vinaya_ the conferring on a woman of the
going forth to become a novice is done by _bhikkhunī_ s, the same text does not
explicitly rule out that a _bhikkhu_ might do the same. An explicit prohibition
only makes its appearance in the commentary, Sp V 967,21. Perhaps the statement by Mahinda, taken out of its context, led to this commentarial gloss; cf.
in more detail below p. 287f note 124.

_khunī_ s from India who could confer ordination and give training
to the female candidates.

Inscriptional evidence establishes the continuity of the _bhik_  _khunī_ lineage in India up to the eighth century and in Sri Lanka
up to the eleventh century. [36] In the case of India the disappearance of the _bhikkhunī_ order appears to have been at least in part
the result of a general decline in urbanism, which would have
deprived them of their principal material support. [37] In Sri Lanka
the order of _bhikkhunī_ s seems to have come to an end during a
period of political turmoil that had decimated the entire monastic
community.

According to the present state of our knowledge there seems to
be no definite proof that a Theravāda order of _bhikkhunī_ s existed
in Myanmar that could have provided the basis for a reintroduction of the _bhikkhunī_ ordination lineage into Sri Lanka. [38] Similarly, in Thailand an order of _bhikkhunī_ s does not seem to have
been in existence in the pre-modern period.


**The Transmission of** _**Bhikkhunī**_ **Ordination to China**

In the early fifth century CE a group of _bhikkhunī_ s travelled
from Sri Lanka to China. [39] At that time the _bhikkhunī_ ordination
lineage had apparently not yet reached China, and local _bhikṣuṇī_ s
had been receiving ordination from _bhikṣu_ s only. The group of Sri
Lankan _bhikkhunī_ s had been decimated during their journey, leaving those who arrived short of the required number for forming

the full quorum to conduct ordinations. Four years later another
group of _bhikkhunī_ s arrived from Sri Lanka. Together with those
who had arrived earlier and had learned Chinese in the meantime,
the Sri Lankan _bhikkhunī_ s gave ordination to a great number of
Chinese candidates.

By the eighth century the Dharmaguptaka _Vinaya_ was apparently imposed on all monastics in China by imperial decree, [40] so
that from then onwards this _Vinaya_ was followed when giving
ordination and carrying out other legal acts.

For evaluating the transmission of the _bhikkhunī_ lineage from
a legal perspective, it is significant that Guṇavarman, a _Vinaya_
expert from India, affirmed the legality of the ordinations carried
out in China earlier, even though, due to the non-existence of both
communities, ordination of female candidates had been conferred
by the community of _bhikṣu_ s only. The relevant passage reports:


Guṇavarman said: "The country did not have both communities, therefore the ordination was [to be] received from the
great community [of _bhikṣu_ s]. [41]


Another passage records Guṇavarman's approval of an explanation given by the Chinese _bhikṣuṇī_ s that, in taking ordination
from _bhikṣu_ s only, they had followed the precedent set by Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī. [42] This is probably best understood as pointing

42 T 2063 at T L 939c17 reports that, in reply to enquiries by the Sri Lankan

_bhikkhunī_ s, the Chinese _bhikṣuṇī_ s explained that they had taken ordination
just from the community of _bhikṣu_ s "because this is just as Mahāprajāpatī

[through] the eight _gurudharma_ s obtained her precepts, and in relation to the
five hundred Śākyan women [Mahā]prajāpatī was most senior. This is our
lofty precedent." According to T 2063 at T L 939c19, Guṇavarman agreed
with this understanding. Whereas the first part of this statement points to the
_gurudharma_ s, the remainder seems to imply that Mahāprajāpatī, even though


240  _Vinaya_ Studies


to the _gurudharma_ s themselves as the legal basis, in particular to
the Dharmaguptaka version of the _gurudharma_ according to which
a female candidate should receive higher ordination from the community of _bhikṣu_ s, a topic to which I return later in more detail.

Alternatively the same approval can be taken to imply that the
precedent for ordination in China was rather the act of acceptance
of all eight _gurudharma_ s by Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī, which according to the _Vinaya_ accounts formed her ordination. Yet, one
would not expect a _Vinaya_ master like Guṇavarman to agree to
such a proposition, as ordination by way of accepting the _guru_ _dharma_ s could only be administered by the Buddha himself and
was no longer a legal option after his passing away. Therefore it
seems more probable that the _gurudharma_ s themselves, in particular the stipulation that _bhikṣuṇī_ s should be ordained by _bhik_ _ṣu_ s, should be considered as forming the legal basis for ordinations carried out in China before the arrival of the Sri Lankan
_bhikkhunī_ s.

Guṇavarman is on record for translating a Dharmaguptaka
_Vinaya_ text for _bhikṣuṇī_ s into Chinese. [43] This makes it probable
that he was ordained in the Dharmaguptaka tradition himself, in
which case he would have been speaking from the perspective of
its legal parameters. Another _Vinaya_ expert, Dàoxuān (道宣), in a
commentary on the Dharmaguptaka _Vinaya_ also concludes that
for the first Chinese _bhikṣuṇī_ s to receive ordination from the community of _bhikṣu_ s only had been a valid procedure. [44]

Even though Guṇavarman considered the ordinations carried
out previously as valid, he approved of the Chinese _bhikṣuṇī_ s

taking ordination again from the Sri Lankan _bhikkhunī_ s. [45] This
seems to have had a function similar to a procedure known in the
Theravāda commentarial tradition as _daḷhīkamma_, literally "an act
of strengthening". [46] In the present case, the ordination by the Sri
Lankan _bhikkhunī_ s strengthened the appeal to legal validity of the
Chinese _bhikṣuṇī_ s. [47]

Regarding the ordination conferred by the Sri Lankan _bhikkhu_  _nī_ s, no further information is available about the actual procedure
adopted at that time. It has been assumed that the Sri Lankan _bhik_ _khunī_ s based themselves on the Dharmaguptaka _Vinaya_ for the
ordination procedure. [48] An evaluation of this suggestion requires
a closer look at these Sri Lankan _bhikkhunī_ s.

The arrival of the first group of Sri Lankan _bhikkhunī_ s in China
might well have been inspired by the wish to transmit the _bhik_ _khunī_ lineage. Just a few years earlier the Chinese pilgrim Fǎxiǎn
( `法顯` ) had visited Sri Lanka. [49] This visit was part of a longer
journey whose main purpose had been to procure _Vinaya_ texts,
which in turn implies his keen interest in _Vinaya_ matters. [50] During Fǎxiǎn’s stay in Sri Lanka, information about the situation in

47 Heirman 2010: 65 states that the conducting by the Sri Lankan _bhikkhunī_ s of

an "ordination ceremony for Chinese nuns seems to have put an end to widespread discussion on the validity of the Chinese nuns' ordination"; although
according to Adamek 2009: 9, "controversy as to whether or not the Chinese
nuns' Saṅgha is legitimate still reverberates to this day."
48 Lévi and Chavannes 1916: 46 hold that "à quelque école que ces nonnes de

Ceylan eussent appartenu d'origine, il est évident qu'elles durent se conformer
aux rites de l'ordination fixés par l'école Dharmagupta." Similarly Heirman
2001: 297 considers that "it is highly improbable that the Pāli _Vinaya_ was the
basic text" for the ordination.

China for female monastics would have spread, making it quite
probable that the wish to transmit the _bhikkhunī_ ordination lineage motivated the first group of Sri Lankan _bhikkhunī_ s to set out
on what in those days was a long and dangerous journey. [51] The
same was certainly the case for the second group, whose arrival
served to complete the required quorum for ordinations to be
given in China.

In view of this it seems improbable that, after undertaking
such a risky journey to transmit the lineage of _bhikkhunī_ ordination, the Sri Lankan _bhikkhunī_ s would confer ordination in a way
that openly conflicted with Theravāda monastic law. The early fifth
century is the time of Buddhaghosa's redaction of the Theravāda
commentaries. The basic ideas about the validity of an ordination,
in the form in which these are recorded in the Pāli commentary on
the _Vinaya_, must have come into existence earlier than that.

According to the Theravāda _Vinaya_ commentary, a mispronunciation of the Pāli formula to be used for ordination invalidates the legal act, [52] let alone using a language different from
Pāli. In view of such a requirement it is difficult to conceive that
the Sri Lankan _bhikkhunī_ s would have conducted an ordination in
Chinese based on a different _Vinaya_ .

Yet, even teaching the Chinese candidates how to perform the
ordination ritual in Pāli would not have resulted in a full transmission of the Theravāda ordination lineage, because for that the cooperation of Theravāda _bhikkhu_ s would have been required. Thus
the ordination conferred by the Sri Lankan _bhikkhunī_ s at that time
could anyway not have fulfilled Theravāda legal requirements.


――――――
51 Guang Xing 2013: 116 notes that Guṇavarman "came to China with the first

group of nuns" from Sri Lanka. This would make it even more probable that
the motivation for their voyage was to transmit the _bhikkhunī_ ordination lineage to China.
52 Sp VII 1399,3; cf. in detail von Hinüber 1987/1994.


_Bhikkhunī_ Ordination  243

**Dual Ordination**

As the previous discussion would have shown, the circumstances of the coming into being of the Chinese order of _bhikṣuṇī_ s
make it doubtful whether it would satisfy traditional Theravāda
notions of a valid transmission of an ordination lineage. Another
and related problem is the uncertainty whether the ordination lineage has been passed on without interruption in China. In view of
the suppression of monasticism during the communist period,
forcing nuns to wear lay clothes and let their hair grow, apprehensions in this respect are perhaps understandable at least for the
case of mainland China. [53]

However, the same basic uncertainty applies also to the _bhik_  _khu_ lineages in South and Southeast Asia, since it is in principle
impossible to provide positive proof that the transmission has
always been passed on in an unbroken manner. [54]

Another problem is related to the establishing of the ritual
boundary for ordination, the _sīmā_ . The Dharmaguptaka _Vinaya_ lists


――――――
53 Cf., e.g., Bianchi 2017: 292.
54 As Kieffer-Pülz 2010: 219 notes, from the viewpoint of tradition the legiti
macy of higher ordination "depends on an uninterrupted ordination lineage
going back to the time of the Buddha and on the acceptance of the legal procedures used to perform these ordinations. It is difficult, if not impossible, for
any of the existing traditions to authenticate both points. Within a tradition,
this is generally not a problem, since a tradition normally accepts its own lineage as pure, even if it cannot produce an uninterrupted list of names. As soon
as one tradition views another tradition's lineage and seeks to evaluate it, however, problems can arise." Hartmann 2010: 26 comments that since "some
kind of positive proof … is _a priori_ unobtainable for a historical process that
spans 2,500 years", when "Vinaya masters assert the unbroken continuity of
their own ordination lineage while casting doubt on the integrity of the Chinese tradition, they … employ rationality and belief at the same time, but for
different ends – rationality for doubting the other tradition and belief for accepting their own."


244  _Vinaya_ Studies


more markers for the establishing of a _sīmā_ than the Theravāda
_Vinaya_ . [55] This leaves open the possibility that such a _sīmā_ marker
has at some time been used in the past, which from the legal viewpoint based on the Theravāda _Vinaya_ and its commentaries would
render the ordinations carried out in such a _sīmā_ invalid. [56]

Similarly to the question of whether the ordination lineage had an
unbroken transmission, the use of markers for the _sīmā_ s during past
ordinations in China can at present no longer be ascertained. Between Theravāda countries there are also differences in this respect,
as in Thailand an additional ninth marker is recognized, [57] which is
without support in the Theravāda _Vinaya_ and commentaries.

The formulations used for the ceremonial acts required for establishing the _sīmā_ also differ between the Dharmaguptaka and the
Theravāda traditions. Unlike the issue of the markers, where it is
uncertain whether 'wrong' markers have been employed, a difference
in formulation must have affected ordinations carried out in China.

Some minor differences can also be found between the formulations related to the _sīmā_ used within the Theravāda traditions
themselves. [58] The Pāli formulas used in the Theravāda traditions

56 Regarding the concern in some Theravāda monastic circles about ensuring

that the _sīmā_ is not invalidated in any way, which would in turn invalidate the
legal act carried out in the ritual space established through the _sīmā_, the eminent Thai monk Vajirañāṇavarorasa 1973/2009b: 50 note 10 dryly comments:
"It has been heard that in Burma the electricity wires are disconnected if a
sanghakamma will be performed. This leads one to think of the air which
flows into the sīmā. Should it too be disconnected?"
57 Kieffer-Pülz 1992: 188 explains that this mark, called _indakhīla_, is buried in

the earth.

to ensure the correctness of legal transactions in general are in
fact all the outcome of some degree of development, since the
Buddha and his monastic disciples did not speak the language we
now refer to as Pāli. [59]

Regarding the canonical attitude towards language, according
to a passage in the _Vinaya_ the Buddha encouraged the use of
_sakāya niruttiyā_, "own language", for memorizing his instructions. [60] Although the commentarial explanation understands this
to refer to the Buddha's own language, [61] it seems more probable
that this refers to "one's own language" and thus encourages the
use of local languages for the memorization and teaching of the
Dharma.

Such an understanding of this passage would be in line with an
injunction in the _Araṇavibhaṅga-sutta_ and its parallel against insisting on a particular local language. [62]

The commentarial tradition, however, as already mentioned
above, considers correct pronunciation of Pāli as essential. A canonical starting point for such emphasis on accurate pronunciation during legal proceedings is found in the _Parivāra_ . This work,
generally considered to be the latest part of the canonical _Vinaya_,
indicates that a legal act becomes invalid if there is a "garbling of
the recitation", _sāvanaṃ hāpeti_ . [63] The commentary on this stipu

lation then lists a series of possible mispronunciations that would
invalidate the proclamation of the legal act, the _kammavācā_ . [64] Regarding the emphasis in the commentary on correct pronunciation, von Hinüber 1987/1994: 228 comments that


it is a long way from the simple _ehi-bhikkhu-upasampadā_
ascribed to the Buddha himself (Vin I 12,13 foll.) to a _kamma_  _vācā_, the wording and pronunciation of which have been laid
down to the last _akṣara_ [letter]. Here it is perhaps not too farfetched to assume the influence of the recitation of Vedic
texts … for, in the same way as the magical effect of the Vedic
_mantras_ is guaranteed only if not even the slightest mistake
has been made in pronouncing them, likewise the validity of
the _kammavācās_ is established in Buddhist law by exactly the
same accuracy in pronunciation.


Such an insistence on accuracy in pronunciation can in fact
become self-defeating. An example, directly related to the ordination procedure, [65] would be the practice of replacing the actual
proper name of the candidate and the preceptor (which during
higher ordination need to be announced) with the names Nāga
and Tissa respectively. [66] This was apparently done to avoid mispronunciation when their real proper names have to be declined in
accordance with Pāli grammar. [67] This custom is reflected in the

_Vimativinodanī-ṭīkā_, a work probably of the twelfth to thirteenth
century, and still in use today in the Theravāda traditions.

This usage is not entirely unproblematic. According to the
_Parivāra_, two out of five reasons that render an ordination invalid
are if the motion does not mention the candidate or the preceptor
by name. [68] Thus the attempt to ensure correct pronunciation during the legal act of ordination has resulted in a procedure that in
itself to some degree undermines that very legality. [69] Of course,
ordinations done in this way are valid inasmuch as using the surrogate names had earlier been agreed on by the participating monastics. Once everyone who took part in the ordination knew that
for the duration of the legal act the candidate was going to be referred to by the name Nāga and the preceptor by the name Tissa,
the ordination is valid.

However, the principle that establishes such validity is to give
importance to the meaning over the letter. This in turn makes it

accord with Pāli grammar was difficult. Later Ācariyas thus set down a method

upajjhāya's name may have been, the convention was established at that time

explains that _vatthuṃ na parāmasati_, the "matter is not touched on", takes
place when the candidate's name is not pronounced, _tassa nāmaṃ na gaṇhāti_ .
Similarly, _puggalaṃ na parāmasati_, the "person is not touched on", happens
when the preceptor's name is not pronounced, _yo upasampadāpekkhasa upaj_  _jhāyo, taṃ na parāmasati, tassa nāmaṃ na gaṇhati_ ; on the significance of
_gaṇhati_ in such contexts cf. Horner 1951/1982: 119 note 1.

248  _Vinaya_ Studies


difficult for those who are ordained in this way to reject another
ordination because it is not carried out in Pāli, as such a rejection
depends on giving importance to the letter over the meaning.

In fact the original intent of the ordination procedure is for the
act to be understood, as evident in particular in the various questions that the candidate is asked to ensure his or her suitability.
Present-day practice for male Theravāda candidates, who often do
not know Pāli, requires remembering how many questions need to
be replied to in Pāli with a negation, _n' atthi bhante_, and at what
point one needs to switch to the affirmative mode, _āma bhante_ .
Although this fulfils the ritual requirements of the Theravāda
tradition, it no longer accomplishes the original function of ascertaining the candidate's qualifications for higher ordination.

Yet the Theravāda monastic lineages are seen by their members
as having ensured their longstanding continuity precisely through
strictly adhering to such accurate ritual performance of legal acts.
As mentioned above, one of these is the correct establishing of the
ritual space for ordination through the _sīmā_ . As a result of such
attitudes, the proper establishing of the _sīmā_ has become a matter
of recurrent controversy among Theravāda _bhikkhu_ communities
that can easily lead to the creation of different ordination lineages
that no longer recognize each other's ordinations as valid.

The use of correctly pronounced Pāli as the ritual language is a
matter of similar concern, to the degree that in some monastic traditions the act of taking refuge at the time of going forth has to be
done twice by varying the pronunciation of the last letter, the _nig_ _gahīta_, in the case of those terms that stand in the accusative. These
are the object of refuge ( _buddhaṃ_ / _dhammaṃ_ / _saṅghaṃ_ ) and the
term "refuge" itself ( _saraṇaṃ_ ). [70] Thus taking refuge in the Buddha, for example, needs to be pronounced once in the form _bud_

70 Bizot 1988: 49 and Kieffer-Pülz 2013:1715–1718.


_Bhikkhunī_ Ordination  249


_dham saraṇam gacchāmi_, and during another recitation of the
refuge formula instead in the alternative form _buddhaŋ saraṇaŋ_
_gacchāmi_ . In the eyes of tradition, incorrect pronunciation of the
formula for taking refuge would jeopardize the legal validity of
the going forth.

The above surveyed legal problems regarding the _sīmā_ as
well as the proper language and pronunciation of the formulas
for legal acts in a way converge on the issue of whether the officiating female preceptors are _nānāsaṃvāsaka_, of a "different
community", vis-à-vis Theravāda monastics. Being of a "different community" would make it impossible for them to carry out
legal acts that will be recognized as valid by traditional members of the Theravāda.

In the canonical _Vinaya_, the notion of _nānāsaṃvāsa_ refers to
the case of a fully ordained monastic who refuses to accept the
view held in the community where he lives regarding whether a
particular act constitutes an offence. The resultant discord on the
implication of the _Vinaya_ rules results either in this monastic,
together with his fully ordained followers, carrying out legal
acts independently from the community, or else the community
banning him or them from participating in their legal acts by an
act of suspension. [71]

The status of being one who is _nānāsaṃvāsaka_ thus comes
into existence because of a dispute about the interpretation of the
rules, wherefore it can be resolved by settling the dispute. Once
there is agreement on the interpretation of the _Vinaya_ rules, those
who were _nānāsaṃvāsaka_ become again _samānasaṃvāsaka_, part
of the same community. This is different from the case when a
fully ordained monastic is no longer in communion, _asaṃvāsa_,
discussed in the first chapter of this book.

250  _Vinaya_ Studies


To my knowledge there is no evidence that there has been a
dispute on _Vinaya_ rules between the Theravāda and the Dharmaguptaka monastic traditions. In fact these two monastic traditions
appear to be simply the product of geographical separation.

However, the rules for _bhikkhunī_ s in the two traditions differ.
Besides differences in formulation, the Dharmaguptaka _Vinaya_
has more rules for nuns than the Theravāda _Vinaya_ . [72] From a
legal viewpoint the two traditions no longer have the same rules to
adhere to.

This condition is unlike the situation between _bhikkhu_ s in
South and Southeast Asia who, despite differences in their vernaculars, the colour of their robes, etc., all rely on what is essentially the same _Vinaya_ text. This has enabled monastics of Burma,
Sri Lanka, and Thailand to import _bhikkhu_ ordination lineages
from each other since, in spite of local variations, these different
lineages were considered to belong to the same overall monastic
tradition. The present case of importing _bhikkhunī_ ordination involves not only more drastic differences in vernaculars and style
of robes, but also a different set of _pātimokkha_ rules.

Such a situation does not have a proper canonical precedent,
since the original formation of the rules took place before the
coming into being of the different Buddhist schools. A related
precedent would be the situation of having become _nānāsaṃ_ _vāsaka_, although this comes about due to a disagreement about
the interpretation of the rules. The present situation, however, involves a difference in the rules an ordination procedures. This
makes it improbable that an attempt to resolve this in a way comparable to the procedures that lead from being _nānāsaṃvāsaka_ to

and 1998, minor differences in formulation and in the sequence of listing already manifest with the _pārājika_ rules, and in the case of the _pācittiya_ rules
the overall number of rules differs; cf. also the survey in Waldschmidt 1926: 5.


_Bhikkhunī_ Ordination  251


becoming again _samānasaṃvāsaka_ will meet with the needed
recognition by leading _bhikkhu_ s of the Theravāda tradition. [73]

In sum, on examining the legal framework, the canonical situation is clearly complex. Keeping in mind that traditional circles
will of course not rely only on the _Vinaya_ itself, but also on its
interpretations in the commentaries, I think it is obvious that such
acceptance is difficult and reservations in this respect are not
surprising.

The principal problem of legal acts undertaken by monastics
of one _Vinaya_ tradition on behalf of members of another _Vinaya_
tradition could be illustrated by turning to secular law. For a legal
act in a particular country to be recognized as valid, it needs to be
based on the law of that country and to be executed by those who
have been invested with legal authority in that country. A public
prosecutor can only take action when cases fall within the sphere
of his or her jurisdiction, not when they fall outside of it. This
does not mean that from the viewpoint of those who live outside
of this jurisdiction the public prosecutor is not considered to be an
attorney or not well versed in law. In other words, this is not a
question of passing a value judgement, but a question of legal applicability. The same holds true for monastic law.

Since the Dharmaguptaka and Theravāda _Vinaya_ s are different
legal codes and the procedure for determining the boundary for
ordination differs, as does the language to be used for conferring
ordination, from a strictly legalist point of view members of one


――――――
73 Vin I 340,34 explains that there are two ways of becoming _samānasaṃvāsaka_ .

The first is when "on one's own one makes oneself to be of the same community", _attanā vā attānaṃ samānasaṃvāsakaṃ_ (B [e] : _samānasaṃvāsaṃ_ ) _karoti_,
i.e., one becomes part of the community through one's own decision, namely
by adopting the view held by the rest of the community regarding the rules.
The second takes place on being reinstituted by the community after one had
been suspended for not seeing an offence, not atoning for it, not giving it up.

of these two _Vinaya_ traditions are not really able to conduct legal
actions, such as the conferral of ordination, that are valid for the
other. Given the importance with which correct legal performance
is endowed in traditional Theravāda monastic circles, [74] the issue
of legal validity in relation to _bhikkhunī_ ordination comes to be
invested with a degree of significance that can hardly be overestimated.

In sum, the various factors surveyed so far taken together
make it quite understandable that it is difficult for traditionalists
to accept the validity of the ordinations given by _bhikṣuṇī_ s from
other monastic lineages who follow a different _Vinaya_ and thus a
different set of rules.

Nowadays the growing feeling of camaraderie among Buddhist women around the globe has led to a sense of international
identity that can be quite different from the _Vinaya_ -based sense of
identity in traditional Theravāda circles. It is little wonder that
supporters of _bhikkhunī_ ordination, wanting to rectify gender discrimination, have fervently argued for the acceptability of introducing the Dharmaguptaka ordination lineage into the Theravāda
tradition. After all, this lineage originates from Sri Lanka. Why
not just bring it back?

At times proponents of this position also draw attention to what
they see as the implicit or explicit patriarchal attitude of senior
_bhikkhu_ s who are believed to fear economic competition from
female monastics and unreasonably reject Chinese monastics. Although such factors may indeed be influencing the situation, focusing excessively on them makes it difficult to appreciate the

legal problems that the acceptance of the validity of Dharmaguptaka ordination poses for members of the Theravāda tradition.
From a strictly legal point of view it is far from straightforward
for members of the Dharmaguptaka or the Theravāda _Vinaya_ traditions to conduct legal actions that are valid for each other.

Rather than a pretence, this is a genuine legal problem. Lacking a central authority for deciding legal matters, the only way for
Theravāda _bhikkhu_ s to resolve such an issue would be through a
unanimous decision. Failing to achieve this rather improbable
solution, if it can even be called such, individual groups of _bhik_ _khu_ s promoting _bhikkhunī_ ordination face the possibility of disruption and separation from the remainder of the monastic Theravāda community; in other words: schism. This is not a light matter and deserves to be recognized for what it is. Instead of being
regarded as a series of empty excuses by patriarchs intent on maintaining their hold on power, opposition in this area needs to be
understood as intimately linked to concerns about fracturing the
Theravāda tradition.

The issue of the validity of higher ordination is also a contentious issue among _bhikkhu_ s in the Theravāda traditions, even
though they rely on the same _Vinaya_ and code of rules. In Thailand, for example, members of the Dhammayuttikanikāya do not
accept the validity of the monastic lineages referred to as the
Mahānikāya. This is not a major problem, however, because the
_bhikkhu_ s of the respective _nikāya_ s simply carry out ordinations
separately, and thus they do not need the other's recognition.

In light of the above surveyed problems that make it difficult for
traditionalists to accept the validity of the Dharmaguptaka ordination lineage, it needs to be ascertained whether such cooperation is
indeed an indispensable requirement for reviving the Theravāda
_bhikkhunī_ order. This is the question to which I turn next, namely
the option of single ordination of _bhikkhunī_ s by _bhikkhu_ s alone.

I begin by translating the narrative found in the _Cullavagga_ of
the Theravāda _Vinaya_ on how Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī became a
_bhikkhunī_ by accepting eight _garudhamma_ s. [75] Here and subsequently, my presentation alternates between translations of the
relevant passages and attempts to draw out their implications
based on a legal reading of the respective narratives.

be good if women could receive the going forth from home to
homelessness in the teaching and discipline made known by
the Tathāgata." [CV X 1.4]

higher ordination:

hundred years ago should pay homage to, rise up for, put the
palms of her hands together, and behave appropriately towards

principle to be revered, respected, honoured, venerated, and
not to be transgressed for the whole of one's life.

4) "After the completion of the rainy season a _bhikkhunī_

This is a principle to be revered, respected, honoured, venerated, and not to be transgressed for the whole of one's life.

5) "A _bhikkhunī_ who has offended against a serious rule is
to undergo penance for a fortnight before both communities.
This is a principle to be revered, respected, honoured, venerated, and not to be transgressed for the whole of one's life.

"Ānanda, if Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī accepts these eight principles to be respected, then that will be her higher ordination." [CV X 1.5]

Then the venerable Ānanda, having learned from the Blessed
One these eight principles to be respected, approached Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī. Having approached her, he said this to Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī:

"Gotamī, if you accept eight principles to be respected,
then that will be your higher ordination:

This is a principle to be revered, respected, honoured, venerated, and not to be transgressed for the whole of one's life.

"Gotamī, if you accept these eight principles to be respected,
then that will be your higher ordination."

[Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī said]: "Venerable Ānanda, it is just
as if there were a young woman or man, youthful and fond of
adornment who, having washed the head, on obtaining a garland of lotuses, of jasmine, or of roses, [256] would accept it
with both hands and place it on the head. Venerable Ānanda,
in the same way I accept these eight principles to be respected,
not to be transgressed for the whole of one's life." [CVX 1.6]

Then the venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One.
Having approached and paid homage to the Blessed One, he
sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the venerable Ānanda
said this to the Blessed One:

"Venerable sir, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī has accepted the
eight principles to be respected; the Blessed One's maternal
aunt has received the higher ordination."


According to the above account, in reply to Ānanda's request
that women be allowed to go forth the Buddha promulgates eight
_garudhamma_ s, stating that their acceptance will count as Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī's higher ordination.

The term _garudhamma_ itself carries distinct meanings in the
Pāli _Vinaya_ . It occurs within the body of the description of _garu_ _dhamma_ 5, according to which a _bhikkhunī_ who has committed a
grave offence ( _garudhamma_ ) needs to undergo penance ( _mānatta_ )
for half a month in both communities. [77] Clearly here the term refers
to a _saṅghādisesa_ offence, the second gravest offence recognized


――――――
77 Vin II 255,17.


_Bhikkhunī_ Ordination  257


in the _Vinaya_, which requires the undergoing of penance. Subsequent to that, the offending monastic has to go through an act of
rehabilitation called _abbhāna_ in front of a community consisting
of at least twenty fully ordained members. In other words, a _saṅ_ _ghādisesa_ offence is a rather serious offence, a breach of the rules
that merits temporary suspension of the offender.

This is, however, not the sense the term _garudhamma_ carries
when referring to the eight principles to be respected themselves. [78]
This becomes evident right away with _garudhamma_ 1, according
to which a senior _bhikkhunī_ should behave respectfully towards a
junior _bhikkhu_ . Transgressing against such behavioural etiquette
is not grave enough to merit temporary suspension. The _Vinaya_ in
fact records several cases where some _bhikkhu_ s behave in an inappropriate manner towards the _bhikkhunī_ s, whereupon the Buddha explicitly enjoins that the _bhikkhunī_ s should no longer pay
respect to them. [79]

The same would hold for _garudhamma_ 8, which stipulates that
_bhikkhunī_ s are not permitted to criticize _bhikkhu_ s. The _Vinaya_ reports that when _bhikkhunī_ s complain about the inappropriate be

muddy water on a _bhikkhunī_ (or _bhikkhunī_ s), exposes his body, or tries to flirt
with a _bhikkhunī_, etc. The expression used here is _avandiyo kātabbo_, "should
be made one to whom no homage is paid". The regulation for the first _garu_  _dhamma_ at Vin II 255,7 is more detailed, as it speaks of _abhivādanaṃ paccuṭ_  _ṭhānaṃ añjalikammaṃ sāmīcikammaṃ kātabbaṃ_, that is, the _bhikkhunī_ "should
pay homage to, rise up [from her seat], hold her hands folded [in homage] and
behave respectfully towards" the junior _bhikkhu_ . Once a _bhikkhu_ is _avandiyo_,
however, I take it that none of these actions will be required from a _bhikkhunī_ .

to bhikkhus provided they make themselves respectable."

haviour of _bhikkhu_ s, [80] the Buddha promulgates a rule to prevent
such misbehaviour by _bhikkhu_ s, without any censure of the _bhik_ _khunī_ s' criticism. Elsewhere the _Vinaya_ states that a _bhikkhunī_
who reproves a _bhikkhu_ commits a _dukkaṭa_ . [81] This makes it fairly
safe to conclude that when a _bhikkhunī_ criticizes a _bhikkhu_ (the
_garudhamma_ prohibits criticism in general, not only unjustified
criticism), this should also not be considered a grave offence of
the _saṅghādisesa_ type.

In the case of _garudhamma_ 5, which concerns the observation
of penance, I suppose that the main issue would be that a _bhikkhu_ _nī_ who is observing penance should notify the _bhikkhu_ s of this. [82]
Again, an infringement of this does not appear to amount to being
a grave offence in itself.

The same is unmistakably clear for the remainder of the _garu_  _dhamma_ s, as these recur as case rules elsewhere in the _Vinaya_,


――――――
80 Cf., e.g., Vin II 263,19, Vin III 209,1, and Vin IV 56,3. These passages de
scribe the complaints in terms of _ujjhāyanti khīyanti_ (B [e] : _khiyyanti_ ) _vipācenti_,
the _bhikkhunī_ s "took offence, complained about it, and found fault with it".
The regulation of the eighth _garudhamma_ at Vin II 255,23 reads _ovaṭo … va_  _canapatho_, literally: "the path of speaking is obstructed", which I take to have
the sense "not being permitted to criticize". The terminology is thus different
and it also seems to me that the _garudhamma_ is about directly criticizing or
admonishing a _bhikkhu_ face to face, whereas the instances described in the
passages quoted above give more the impression that the _bhikkhunī_ s make it
known in general that something improper has happened. Nevertheless, the
similarity in the basic act of voicing disapproval or criticism seems sufficient
to conclude that a breach of this _garudhamma_ would not have been considered
a _saṅghādisesa_ offence. In fact, if the issue at stake is directly confronting a
_bhikkhu_, _pācittiya_ 95 at Vin IV 344,13 would be relevant. According to this
rule, a _bhikkhunī_ should not ask a _bhikkhu_ questions without having been given
leave to do so, which I assume intends to prevent that a _bhikkhu_ be asked face
to face intricate questions which he might be unable to answer.
81 Vin II 276,16: _codentiyā āpatti dukkaṭassa_ .
82 In addition, of course, to the duties she has to fulfil towards the _bhikkhunī_ s.

where they are all found in the _pācittiya_ class. [83] A _pācittiya_ is an
offence of a lighter class that requires disclosure to a fellow monastic and, if possessions are involved, their formal forfeiture.

Thus _garudhamma_ 2, according to which a _bhikkhunī_ should
not spend the rainy-season retreat in a place where there is no
_bhikkhu_, is identical to _pācittiya_ 56 for _bhikkhunī_ s. [84] The third
_garudhamma_ stipulates that a _bhikkhunī_ should enquire every
fortnight about the date of the observance day ( _uposatha_ ) from
the community of _bhikkhu_ s and ask for exhortation ( _ovāda_ ),
which corresponds to _pācittiya_ 59. [85] According to _garudhamma_ 4,
a _bhikkhunī_ should carry out the invitation ( _pavāraṇā_ ) for any of
her shortcomings to be pointed out in both communities, which
has its counterpart in _pācittiya_ 57. [86] The sixth _garudhamma_ concerns ordination by both communities, to which I will return below. According to _garudhamma_ 7, a _bhikkhunī_ should not revile
or abuse a _bhikkhu_, which corresponds to _pācittiya_ 52. [87]

In sum, the principles to be respected do not belong to the category of grave offences, even though for both the same term _garu_ _dhamma_ can be used.

The _Vinaya_ reports that the promulgation of the _pācittiya_ rules
just surveyed takes place in reply to some event that involves _bhik_ _khunī_ s. Adopting the viewpoint of the _Vinaya_, these events are to
be understood as something that happened after the promulgation
of the _garudhamma_ s, which marks the coming into existence of
the order of _bhikkhunī_ s. Notably, each of the _pācittiya_ rules that
parallel a _garudhamma_ makes the standard remark that is com

mon for _Vinaya_ rules, according to which the first perpetrator
( _ādikammika_ ) is not guilty, _anāpatti_ . In other words, the first to
transgress against the _pācittiya_ rules corresponding to _garudham_ _ma_ [[SN2]] 3, 4 and 7 does not commit an offence. Only after the corresponding _pācittiya_ rule has come into existence are transgressors considered guilty.

This implies that, from the viewpoint of the canonical _Vinaya_,
the eight _garudhamma_ s are not rules in themselves. Otherwise it
would be impossible to transgress them, once they have been
promulgated, and still not be considered to have incurred an offence. In fact, the eight _garudhamma_ s themselves do not make
any stipulation about what happens if one violates them. Nor are
the _garudhamma_ s formally part of the _bhikkhunī pātimokkha_, unlike those of the _pācittiya_ s that correspond to them.

In sum, the eight principles to be respected are not rules per se;
instead, they are recommendations. [88] As the formula describing
each of these eight indicates, they are something to be respected,
hence their name _garudhamma_, "principle to be respected".

With this basic assessment of the legal nature of the _garudham_  _ma_ s in mind, leaving aside the issue of their historical development
as not directly relevant to the present legal discussion, it is now time
to turn to the sixth _garudhamma_ . This stipulates that a woman
wishing to receive _bhikkhunī_ ordination should have undergone a
two-year training period as a _sikkhamānā_, after which she should
request higher ordination from both communities, that is, from the
_bhikkhu_ s and the _bhikkhunī_ s. The need for a two-year training period as a _sikkhamānā_ has a counterpart in _pācittiya_ 63. [89]


――――――
88 Kawanami 2007: 237 quotes a Burmese _bhikkhu_ to the effect that the eight

" _garudhamma_ rules were only 'instructions' given by the Buddha … representative of monastic protocol observed at the time of the Buddha to safeguard
harmonious relationships in the community."

_Bhikkhunī_ Ordination  261


As argued convincingly by Bodhi (2009: 45), a _bhikkhunī_
ordination does not become invalid if the female candidate has
not received or not completed the training as a _sikkhamānā_ . [90]
Thus failing to fulfil this requirement does not invalidate the
higher ordination. Since the _sikkhamānā_ training is part of the
sixth _garudhamma_, it follows, as pointed out by Bodhi (2009:
47), "that the _Vinaya_ did not regard as invalid an _upasampadā_
ordination that failed to fully conform to the procedures laid
down in the eight _garudhammas_ ."

Returning to the _Vinaya_ passage translated above, since it
reports the Buddha presenting the eight _garudhamma_ s in reply to
a general request that women be allowed to go forth, from the
viewpoint of the Theravāda _Vinaya_ narrative it seems that he has
now decided to start an order of _bhikkhunī_ s; he is not merely
making a special allowance only for his foster mother. In other
words, although the procedure of receiving ordination through the
acceptance of the _garudhamma_ s is valid for Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī


――――――
90 After indicating that giving full ordination to a female candidate who has not

trained for two years as a _sikkhamānā_ results in a _pācittiya_ offence for the ordaining _bhikkhunī_ s, the _Bhikkhunī-vibhaṅga_ continues by discussing three possible cases when this could happen but the ordination itself is legal, Vin IV
320,5. These discussions clearly imply that the ordination itself is not invalidated
by the fact that the candidate has not fulfilled the _sikkhamānā_ training. Bodhi
2009: 48 also points out that the precepts required for the preliminary training to
be fulfilled as a _sikkhamānā_ could also be administered by a _bhikkhu_, which
suggests itself from Vin I 147,13, according to which a _bhikkhu_ is permitted to
leave his rains residence for up to seven days in order to administer the training
(i.e., the _sikkhamānā_ precepts) to a _sāmaṇerī_ . Regarding the preceding step of
going forth, Bodhi 2009: 49 notes that "there is no stipulation in the Vinaya
explicitly prohibiting a bhikkhu from giving _pabbajjā_ to a woman"; cf. also
above p. 237 note 34. However, according to Sp V 967,22 a woman can only
receive _pabbajjā_ from a _bhikkhunī_ ; on which cf. below p. 287f note 124. For a
discussion of the situation in the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ cf. Clarke 2010: 229.


262  _Vinaya_ Studies


alone, nevertheless her higher ordination needs to be considered a
first step in a development that is aiming at "allowing women to
go forth from home to homelessness in the teaching and discipline made known by the Tathāgata". The same is evident from
the formulation of the _garudhamma_ s themselves, as several of
these deal with situations that arise once an order of _bhikkhunī_ s
has come into existence, not with a situation where Mahāpajāpatī
Gotamī is the only existing _bhikkhunī_ .

Now in the _Cullavagga_ narrative translated earlier, the Buddha
is on record for promulgating _garudhamma_ 6, together with the
other principles to be respected, in reply to Ānanda's request to
create an opportunity for women to go forth in the Buddha's dispensation. In this way the Theravāda _Vinaya_ presents the Buddha
as asking Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī to accept a stipulation that she
will not be able to carry out. Even though by accepting the whole
set of eight _garudhamma_ s she could become a _bhikkhunī_, she
would not be able to form the quorum required for carrying out
the preparation for and conferring of the higher ordination of her
following of Sakyan women who also wanted higher ordination.
From the outset it was clear that she would be unable to act according to _garudhamma_ 6 in the way this is now found in the
Theravāda _Vinaya_ . [91]
――――――
91 From a historical perspective it seems fairly clear that the reference to the pro
bationary training in _garudhamma_ 6 is a later addition; cf. Tsedroen and Anālayo 2013: 748–750. However, this is not of relevance to my present discussion, since for anyone ordained in the Theravāda tradition the legal basis
for ordination is the Theravāda _Vinaya_ in the way it has been preserved in
Pāli, not any historical reconstruction. For a legal reading of the Theravāda
_Vinaya_ the text as it is has to be taken into account. Although Sujato 2009:
184f holds that the present formulation "does not say that all _bhikkhunī_ candidates need to do _sikkhamānā_ training", this appears to be precisely what this
_garudhamma_ implies. Thus for a female candidate for higher ordination in the
Theravāda tradition, the probationary training is a legal requirement.


_Bhikkhunī_ Ordination  263


Taking into account the way the Buddha is presented elsewhere in the canonical texts, it seems hardly plausible to assume
that the _Vinaya_ is presenting him as having overlooked the fact
that he was promulgating a ruling that right away was impossible
to keep. In fact I am not aware of any case in the _Vinaya_ where
the Buddha is shown to be giving a ruling that, as soon as it is
promulgated, is impossible to put into practice. The _Vinaya_ does
record numerous instances where the Buddha finds a need to
amend rules, but these arise because of problems that manifested
subsequently, not because straight away the rule could not be followed at all.

Therefore a more convincing interpretation of the narrative
rationale of the present episode would be to assume that it presents
the Buddha as acting on purpose in this way. This impression is
supported by the fact that he could have been shown to take alternative courses of action. A simple alternative would have been
for the Buddha to formulate _garudhamma_ 6 in a different way. He
could have simply stipulated the need for female candidates to
receive ordination from _bhikkhu_ s, without mentioning any cooperation by _bhikkhunī_ s (and without bringing in the need for
probationary training). [92] Such a formulation would have been
entirely unproblematic. Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī's followers could
have been directly ordained by the _bhikkhu_ s, without any need for
Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī to come back and enquire about how to
proceed. Yet this is not what the Theravāda _Vinaya_ reports.

The way the Theravāda _Vinaya_ presents the situation inevitably results in creating a situation where Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī has
to come back to the Buddha for further instructions. This inevi――――――
92 This is in fact the way this _garudhamma_ is formulated in the Mūlasarvāsti

1435 at T XXIII 345c10, and T 1461 at T XXIV 670c6, and in more detail

table result of the narrative progression in turn sets the stage for
the Buddha to legislate on how to proceed in such a situation,
which is precisely what happens next in the Pāli _Vinaya_ . [93] [CV X 2.1]


Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī approached the Blessed One.
Having approached and paid homage to the Blessed One, she
stood to one side. Standing to one side, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī
said this to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, how should I proceed in relation to those Sakyan women?" [257]

Then the Blessed One instructed, encouraged, inspired, and
gladdened Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī with a discourse on the Dharma. Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī, having been instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened by the Blessed One with a
discourse on the Dharma and having paid homage to the
Blessed One, left keeping her right side towards him.

Then the Blessed One, having given a discourse on the
Dharma in relation to this matter, addressed the _bhikkhu_ s:
" _Bhikkhu_ s, I authorize the giving of the higher ordination to
_bhikkhunī_ s by _bhikkhu_ s." [CV X 2.2]

Then those _bhikkhunī_ s said this to Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī:
"The lady is not higher ordained, we are higher ordained. [94] It
has been prescribed by the Blessed One: ' _Bhikkhunī_ s should be
higher ordained by _bhikkhu_ s.'"

Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī approached the venerable
Ānanda. Having approached and paid homage to the venerable
Ānanda, she stood to one side. Standing to one side, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī said this to the venerable Ānanda: "Venerable

Ānanda, these _bhikkhunī_ s said this to me: 'The lady is not
higher ordained, we are higher ordained. For the Blessed One
has prescribed this: " _Bhikkhunī_ s should be higher ordained by
_bhikkhu_ s."'"

Then the venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One.
Having approached and paid homage to the Blessed One, he
sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the venerable Ānanda
said this to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, Mahāpajāpatī
Gotamī says this: 'Venerable Ānanda, these _bhikkhunī_ s said
this to me: "The lady is not higher ordained, we are higher
ordained. For the Blessed One has prescribed this: ' _Bhikkhunī_ s
should be higher ordained by _bhikkhu_ s.'"'"

[The Buddha said]: "Ānanda, when Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī
accepted the eight principles to be respected, then that was her
higher ordination."


According to the excerpt translated above, the Buddha authorized _bhikkhu_ s to ordain female candidates on their own in a situation where no community of _bhikkhunī_ s had yet come into existence. Two aspects of this description require further comment:
the permission for _bhikkhu_ s to ordain _bhikkhunī_ s on their own and
the legal status of Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī as well as of her followers.

As would have become evident from the previous section of
this chapter, the most reasonable interpretation for the Buddha's
promulgation of _garudhamma_ 6, from the viewpoint of the narrative in the Theravāda _Vinaya_, would be to create an opportunity
for further legislation. This is precisely what happens in the passage translated above, when predictably Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī
approaches the Buddha to ask how she should proceed. She had
accepted _garudhamma_ 6, but was unable to act according to it.

Now in this narrative setting, to settle the situation of Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī's followers, the Buddha could have easily ordained


266  _Vinaya_ Studies


them himself. A simple act of ordination on his part would have
sufficed and been a straightforward solution, similar to the way he
elsewhere ordains _bhikkhu_ s himself. [95] An even easier solution
would have been to make the acceptance of the eight _garudham_ _ma_ s serve as the higher ordination for Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī's followers as well. [96] Such a use of the _garudhamma_ ordination procedure would have been straightforward and no further action would
have been required. The _bhikkhunī_ community created in this way
would have been able to cooperate with _bhikkhu_ s in future ordinations, in accordance with _garudhamma_ 6. But this is not how the
Theravāda _Vinaya_ narration proceeds.

Instead, the Buddha is on record for delegating the task of ordination to the _bhikkhu_ s. In this way the Theravāda _Vinaya_ narrative reads as if the Buddha first creates the conditions for further
legislation and then uses this to promulgate a rule that _bhikkhu_ s
should ordain _bhikkhunī_ s on their own in a situation where no
――――――
95 This could even have been done with the simple _ehi_ type of ordination attested

in Thī 109: _ehi bhadde 'ti avaca, sā me ās' ūpasampadā_, which _pace_ the position taken in Thī-[[AN104.23]] (= Thī-[[AN107]] in the 1893 edition of Thī-a) seems to
refer to ordination granted by the Buddha himself. Contrary to what I assumed
in Anālayo 2010g: 84, such testimony to the _ehi_ type of ordination does not
stand in contrast to _garudhamma_ 6 as recorded in the _Cullavagga_, since the
Buddha as the legislator was not subject to his own rules and thus free to grant
the "come nun" type of ordination any time he wished to do so. In the case of
Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī's followers, the Buddha could have freely chosen to
ordain them in whatever way he preferred, without being himself bound in
this by _garudhamma_ 6; cf. also above p. 177 note 25 regarding this option.
The suggestion by Alsdorf 1967: 317f that the _ehi_ type of ordination is a later
invention is not convincing.
96 This is in fact reported in the Dharmaguptaka _Vinaya_ s and the (Haimavata?)

 - _Vinayamātṛkā_ ; cf. T 1428 at T XXII 923c8 and T 1463 at T XXIV 803b24.
In these two _Vinaya_ texts, the _gurudharma_ s from the outset serve the function of granting higher ordination to Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī and to her followers.


_Bhikkhunī_ Ordination  267


_bhikkhunī_ community able to cooperate with them is in existence.
On this reading, the circumstances and details described in the
_Vinaya_ narration fall into place in a meaningful manner.

If one instead were to presume that the authorization for _bhik_  _khu_ s was meant to settle the situation at that one time in the past
only, one would have to consider the Theravāda _Vinaya_ as showing the Buddha to be acting inconsistently or even overlooking
the consequences of what he is doing. [97] For him to promulgate
_garudhamma_ 6 in the form now found in the Pāli _Vinaya_ only
really makes sense if one assumes that the _Vinaya_ narrative shows
him to be creating an opportunity to provide additional legislation
alongside the basic indication that the ordination of women
should be carried out by both communities. To create such an
opportunity in turn only really makes sense if it is meant to lead to
a general rule, instead of a makeshift solution for one single occasion only.

Such additional legislation then is relevant not only for the
present occasion, but also for future occasions whenever the conditions that led to its promulgation recur. That is, it is relevant
whenever a _bhikkhunī_ order is not in existence. This interpretation
is nothing new, as it has already been suggested by the Jetavan
Sayādaw, the venerable U Narada Mahāthera, in a commentary
――――――
97 Ṭhānissaro 2015: 12 argues that "to assert that the Buddha did not want

Cv.X.17.2 (the rule for double ordination) to rescind Cv.X.2.1 (the rule for
unilateral ordination), but forgot to limit the conditions under which Cv.X.
17.2 would apply, is to assert that he was thoughtless and careless." One could
similarly argue that for the Buddha not to make more explicit his presumed
wish that the rule on single ordination be abolished is thoughtless. In the present case, however, the issue it not an absence of additional specifications that
one might like to see and thus not merely an argument from silence, but rather
an explicit ruling that is found in the _Vinaya_ . If this ruling is interpreted according to the position taken by Ajahn Ṭhānissaro, it would indeed result in
attributing to the Buddha the role of being quite thoughtless.

on the _Milindapañha_ composed in Pāli and published in 1949, to
which I will come back below. [98]

The other aspect of the narrative in _Cullavagga_ X 2.2 to be
discussed is the allegation of Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī's followers
that she had not been properly ordained. Here the Buddha's reply
makes it unmistakably clear that Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī had indeed
received the higher ordination.

The _bhikkhunī_ status of Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī can also be seen,
for example, from _bhikkhu pācittiya_ 23. This rule prevents a _bhik_ _khu_ from going to the dwelling place of _bhikkhunī_ s to give them
exhortation. The relevant _Vinaya_ narrative reports that the Buddha made a special amendment to this rule in relation to Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī. On one occasion she had been sick. Some _bhik_ _khu_ s paying her a visit to enquire about her condition did not give
her an exhortation, in order to keep this rule. When the Buddha
came himself to visit her, she told him that she missed the inspiration she had earlier received from _bhikkhu_ s giving her an exhortation. This motivated the Buddha to give her a discourse on the
Dharma himself, and to amend the rule to the effect that a _bhikkhu_
can give an exhortation to a _bhikkhunī_ in her dwelling place if she
is sick. [99] This regulation is caused by an episode involving Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī as a _bhikkhunī_ and is meant to enable her, as well
as other _bhikkhunī_ s, to receive a visit and an exhortation from
_bhikkhu_ s when they are sick.

Her status as a _bhikkhunī_ also emerges from the listing of outstanding _bhikkhunī_ disciples in the _Aṅguttara-nikāya_, which accords to Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī the rank of being foremost among
the _bhikkhunī_ s for being of long standing. [100] In sum, there can be

_Bhikkhunī_ Ordination  269


no doubt that Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī was reckoned a _bhikkhunī_ in
Pāli canonical texts.

That the same holds for her followers is implicit in the fact
that the Buddha is not shown to object to their claim to have received higher ordination. Instead, on being informed by Ānanda
of what they had said, the Buddha is only shown to object to their
assumption that Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī had not received the higher
ordination, clarifying that this was a misunderstanding. In short,
Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī and her followers were _bhikkhunī_ s.

Now the various rules for _bhikkhunī_ s in the _Vinaya_ come together with a definition of what it means to be a _bhikkhunī_ . This
definition, found right away in the word explanation ( _padabhāja_ _nīya_ ) of the first _pārājika_ rule for _bhikkhunī_ s, reads as follows: [101]


A ' _bhikkhunī_ ' [means]: [being called] a _bhikkhunī_ [because]
'she begs', a _bhikkhunī_ [because] 'she has consented to the conduct of begging', a _bhikkhunī_ [because] 'she wears a patchwork
robe', a _bhikkhunī_ [because] of being called such [by others], a
_bhikkhunī_ [because] 'she acknowledges to be one', a _bhikkhunī_

[because of having been ordained by the address] 'come _bhik_  _khunī_ ', a _bhikkhunī_ [because] of having received higher ordination by way of going for the three refuges, a _bhikkhunī_ [because she is a source of] auspiciousness, a _bhikkhunī_ [because
she is like that] in substance, a _bhikkhunī_ [because] she is in
training, a _bhikkhunī_ [because] she has gone beyond training,
and a _bhikkhunī_ [because] she has been higher ordained in a
way that is unchallengeable and fit to stand by both complete
communities through a formal transaction with one motion
and three proclamations.

Herein a _bhikkhunī_ who has been higher ordained in a way
that is unchallengeable and fit to stand by both complete com

munities through a formal transaction with one motion and
three proclamations, this is what is meant by the designation of
' _bhikkhunī_ '.


The main point made by this definition of the term _bhikkhunī_
is to clarify that the _Vinaya_ rules only apply to those who are properly ordained; they do not apply to someone just called _bhik_ _khunī_ for any other reason. A similar definition exists for _bhik_ _khu_ s, found in the word explanation for the first _pārājika_ for _bhik_ _khu_ s. This definition also contrasts a _bhikkhu_ ordained by a formal transaction with one motion and three proclamations to
someone who is just called a _bhikkhu_ because he begs, etc. [102]

Care needs to be taken when handling this definition as applicable to instances of the term _bhikkhu_ in the remainder of the
_Vinaya_ . Here room has to be made for the fact that, according to
the Pāli _Vinaya_ account, Mahākassapa presided over the recitation
of the discourses and the _Vinaya_ at the first _saṅgīti_ . [103] Obviously
this implies that he was still alive and also still a _bhikkhu_ .


――――――
102 Vin III 24,3. When considered from a historical perspective, the part of the _Vi-_

_naya_ that gives such word explanations appears to have originated as a commentary that later became part of the text on which it commented; cf., e.g., Norman 1983a: 19, von Hinüber 1996/1997: 14, and Kieffer-Pülz 2015: 430. The
definition of what makes a _bhikkhu_ could in fact only have come into being once
all _bhikkhu_ s ordained by the Buddha personally had passed away. At that time,
the only _bhikkhu_ s to be taken into account were just those ordained by a formal
transaction with one motion and three proclamations. In other words, from a historical perspective this passage could only have come into being considerably
later than the first _saṅgīti_, when according to Vin II 286,26 various other details
related to the first _pārājika_ were already discussed. During the course of oral
transmission of the _Vinaya_, the former commentary eventually would have become part of the canonical text itself. For my present legal reading, however,
such considerations are not of direct relevance, since this definition is now part
of the Theravāda _Vinaya_ itself and thus carries full canonical validity.
103 Vin II 286,16.


_Bhikkhunī_ Ordination  271


Now the report of Mahākassapa's first meeting with the Buddha in the _Saṃyutta-nikāya_ records three instructions given to
him by the Buddha, and according to the commentary these three
instructions formed his higher ordination. [104] The commentary on
the definition of a _bhikkhu_ in fact refers to the case of Mahākassapa's ordination as a distinct form of ordination by "accepting an
instruction", _ovādapaṭiggahaṇūpasampadā_ . [105] This type of ordination is not explicitly mentioned in the _Vinaya_ definition of a
_bhikkhu_ .

This example shows why care is required in the way the definition of the term _bhikkhu_ is interpreted. It seems best to take it as
referring to ordination by a formal transaction with one motion
and three proclamations as an example of an ordination that is
"unchallengeable and fit to stand", not as the only possible option
for an ordination that is "unchallengeable and fit to stand".

If one were to insist that only those ordained by a formal transaction with one motion and three proclamations can be reckoned
as legally valid _bhikkhu_ s, and nobody else, then strictly speaking
Mahākassapa would also not count as a _bhikkhu_ . One would then
be forced to conclude that the Theravāda _Vinaya_ does not recognize the convenor of the first _saṅgīti_ as a _bhikkhu_ . Such a conclusion would not only be absurd, it would actually be self-defeating,
as it would result in the codification of monastic law at the first
_saṅgīti_ being the result of a recital undertaken at the request and
under the leadership of a non- _bhikkhu_ .

Instead of depriving the main protagonist in the codification of
the _Vinaya_ of his legal authority, it seems preferable to adopt an
open interpretation that leaves room for the validity of forms of

higher ordination in addition to the one by a formal transaction
with one motion and three proclamations mentioned in the _Vinaya_
definition of a _bhikkhu_, as long as these forms of ordination are
similarly "unchallengeable and fit to stand". This is clearly the
case for Mahākassapa.

In the same vein, when interpreting the definition of a _bhik_  _khunī_ one would have to make allowances for Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī's higher ordination by accepting the eight _garudhamma_ s as
well as for her followers being ordained by _bhikkhu_ s only. Neither
type of ordination is explicitly mentioned in the definition of a
_bhikkhunī_, translated above, similarly to the case of Mahākassapa's ordination not being mentioned in the definition of a _bhik_ _khu_ . Yet, as discussed above, the _Vinaya_ narrative leaves no doubt
that they should be reckoned _bhikkhunī_ s.

In sum, then, in relation to the _Vinaya_ definitions of a _bhikkhu_
as well as of a _bhikkhunī_, higher ordination by one or both complete communities respectively is best considered as a typical
example of an ordination that is "unchallengeable and fit to stand",
instead of being an exhaustive account of valid ordinations.

Whereas the form of higher ordinations received by Mahākassapa and Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī were administered by the Buddha
himself and are not forms of ordination that can be given by others,
the higher ordination given to Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī's followers
differs, as such an ordination can be given by _bhikkhu_ s. Keeping
in mind the above suggested conclusions, the definition of what
makes one a _bhikkhunī_ would leave open the possibility of _bhik_ _khunī_ s being ordained by _bhikkhu_ s on their own, if this takes place
in a situation where such a form of higher ordination is legally
valid. In other words, it would leave open the possibility of such
an ordination taking place when no _bhikkhunī_ order capable of cooperating in such an ordination is in existence. In such a situation,
higher ordination by a community of _bhikkhu_ s alone would be "un

challengeable and fit to stand", and those ordained in this way
would have to be considered as falling within the scope of the
legal definition of a _bhikkhunī_ .

The Theravāda _Vinaya_ reports further developments in matters
of _bhikkhunī_ ordination as follows: [106] [CV X 17.1]


At that time there were seen among the higher ordained those
who had no [sexual] organs, incomplete [sexual] organs, who
did not menstruate [regularly], who menstruated continuously,
who continuously had to use a sanitary cloth, who were incontinent, who had uterine prolapse, who were female _paṇḍaka_ s, [107]
who were androgynes, whose [urethra and anus] were conjoined,
who were hermaphrodites. They told this to the Blessed One,

[who said]:

" _Bhikkhu_ s, I authorize who is giving higher ordination to a
female candidate to question her about twenty-four stumbling
blocks. _Bhikkhu_ s, she should be questioned in this way:

Are your robes and bowl complete (24)? What is your name?
What is the name of your preceptor ( _pavattinī_ )?'" [108] [CV X 17.2]

At that time the _bhikkhu_ s asked the _bhikkhunī_ s about the
stumbling blocks. [109] Those who wanted to be higher ordained
were abashed; they were embarrassed and unable to reply.
They told this to the Blessed One, [who said]:

" _Bhikkhu_ s, I authorize the higher ordination in the community of _bhikkhu_ s for one who has been higher ordained on one
side and has cleared herself in the community of _bhikkhunī_ s."

At that time the _bhikkhunī_ s questioned about the stumbling
blocks those who wanted to be higher ordained and who had
not been instructed [about this type of questioning]. Those
who wanted to be higher ordained were abashed, [272] they
were embarrassed and unable to reply. They told this to the

" _Bhikkhu_ s, I authorize that she should first be instructed

They instructed them just there in the midst of the community.
Those who wanted to be higher ordained were still abashed,

108 As noted by J.-H. Shih 2000: 391 note 97, the _Cullavagga_ uses the terms

_pavattinī_ and _upajjhā_ interchangeably.
109 The formulation seems to point to an involvement of the _bhikkhunī_ s in the or
dination procedure at this stage, presumably being asked by the _bhikkhu_ s to
question the candidates on their behalf; cf. in more detail Anālayo 2017e.

midst of the community. _Bhikkhu_ s, she should be instructed in
this way: First she should be made to take a [female] preceptor
( _upajjhā_ ). [Once] she has taken a preceptor, bowl and robes
should be pointed out [to her]: 'This is your bowl, this is the outer
cloak, this is the upper robe, this is the lower robe, this is the
vest, [110] and this is the bathing cloth. Go and stand in that place.'"


The above regulation has as its narrative background the need
to avoid the embarrassment of female candidates. The _Vinaya_
does not offer explicit indications regarding what happened in the
interim period, after the ordination of Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī and
her following of Sakyan women. Given that the formulation of
_garudhamma_ 6, in the way this is found in the Theravāda _Vinaya_,
implies that the Buddha had made it clear that in principle he
wanted female candidates to go through a probationary period and
then receive the higher ordination from both communities, this
procedure would presumably have come into use once an order of
_bhikkhunī_ s had come into existence. In fact an alternative interpretation, according to which dual ordination only came into being
in response to the embarrassment of the _bhikkhunī_ s, fails to take
into account that the principle of dual ordination has already been
promulgated with _garudhamma_ 6. [111]


――――――
110 On the vest cf. von Hinüber and Anālayo 2016.
111 Some form of dual ordination in existence already before the embarrassment

episode seems to be implicit in the formulation mentioned above in note 109. A
use of the term _bhikkhunī_ to refer to the candidates for ordination would only
work if the procedure indeed results in them becoming _bhikkhunī_ s. Due to not
replying to the questions about stumbling blocks, the ordination procedure described in the present episode could not have been carried through, wherefore it
would not work to refer to its candidates as _bhikkhunī_ s. In fact the remainder of
this section of the _Vinaya_ consistently uses the expression _upasampadāpekkhā_ to
refer to the candidates. This gives the impression that the reference mentioned
above is indeed to _bhikkhunī_ s who participate in the granting of ordination.


276  _Vinaya_ Studies


Whatever happened in the interim period, the _Vinaya_ narration
translated above proceeds beyond the basic procedure described
in _garudhamma_ 6. Instead of just a reference to _bhikkhu_ s and _bhik_ _khunī_ s giving higher ordination together, the procedure to be adopted now is that the _bhikkhunī_ order should give ordination first, then
ordination should be given by _bhikkhu_ s. A further episode then
leads to additional ruling on ordination by messenger. [112] [CV X 22.1]


At that time the [former] courtesan Aḍḍhakāsī had gone
forth among the _bhikkhunī_ s. She wanted to go to Sāvatthī,

[thinking]: 'I will be higher ordained in the presence of the
Blessed One.' Rogues had heard that: "It seems that the [former] courtesan Aḍḍhakāsī wants to go to Sāvatthī" and they
took control of the road. The [former] courtesan Aḍḍhakāsī
heard that: "It seems that rogues have taken control of the road."
She sent a messenger to the Blessed One's presence, [saying]:
"I indeed wish to be higher ordained, how should I proceed?"

Then the Blessed One, having given a discourse on the Dharma in relation to this matter, addressed the _bhikkhu_ s: " _Bhik_  _khu_ s, I also authorize the giving of the higher ordination by
messenger." [CV X 22.2]

They gave higher ordination through a _bhikkhu_ as messenger. They told this to the Blessed One, [who said]: " _Bhikkhu_ s,
higher ordination should not be given through a _bhikkhu_ as
messenger. For those who give higher ordination [in this way]
there is an offence of wrongdoing." They gave higher ordination through a probationer as messenger … they gave higher
ordination through a male novice as messenger … they gave
higher ordination through a female novice as messenger …
they gave higher ordination through a messenger who was
foolish and inexperienced. [They told this to the Blessed One

who said]: " _Bhikkhu_ s, higher ordination should not be given …
through a messenger who is foolish and inexperienced. For
those who give higher ordination [in this way] there is an offence of wrongdoing. _Bhikkhu_ s, I authorize the giving of the
higher ordination through an experienced and competent _bhik_  _khunī_ as messenger."


The above ruling has as its rationale the wish to protect a _bhik_  _khunī_ candidate from the danger of being raped by rogues. In order to prevent such a thing from happening, the Buddha is on record for making a special allowance that the candidate does not
have to approach the community of _bhikkhu_ s personally. Instead,
another _bhikkhunī_ who is experienced and competent can act as a
messenger on behalf of the candidate.

Judging from other passages in the _Vinaya_, the danger of rape
did not affect only those who had formerly been courtesans, but
was a problem for _bhikkhunī_ s in general. [113] Single _bhikkhunī_ s
crossing a river were raped and a _bhikkhunī_ who in order to relieve herself had stayed behind a group of _bhikkhunī_ s with whom
she was travelling was also raped. [114] Whole groups of _bhikkhunī_ s
were raped when travelling or when crossing a river. [115] Having
been informed of this, the Buddha is on record for promulgating
amended versions of _bhikkhu pācittiya_ [[SN27]] and 28, according to
which _bhikkhu_ s are to act as travel companions for _bhikkhunī_ s if
their journey appears risky or if they have to cross a river.

The danger of being raped was apparently not confined to
being on a journey. Even being in one's hut seems not to have
been safe. According to the narrative portion that comes after the


――――――

first _pārājika_ for _bhikkhu_ s, the arahant _bhikkhunī_ Uppalavaṇṇā
was raped by a man who had hidden in her hut and assaulted her
when she came back from begging for alms. [116]

In view of this situation, it would indeed be a meaningful consideration to take into account the vulnerability of _bhikkhunī_ s in
this respect and adjust the ordination procedure in such a way that
any endangering of the female candidate can be avoided.

Now the rulings given by the Buddha on _bhikkhunī_ ordination
in the Theravāda _Vinaya_ result in altogether four promulgations:


  - A probationer who has trained for two years in six principles

should seek higher ordination from both communities.

  - I authorize the giving of the higher ordination to _bhikkhunī_ s

by _bhikkhu_ s.

  - I authorize the giving of the higher ordination in the commu
nity of _bhikkhu_ s for one who has been higher ordained on
one side and has cleared herself in the community of _bhik_   _khunī_ s.

  - I authorize the giving of the higher ordination through an

experienced and competent _bhikkhunī_ as messenger.


According to the presentation in the Theravāda _Vinaya_, the
first and foundational indication of how the Buddha wanted the
higher ordination of female candidates to be carried out is the
sixth _garudhamma_ . This is no longer relevant, as it has been replaced by subsequent amendments.

In relation to these three subsequent amendments, it is clearly
not the case that only the last one mentioned is valid. Even though
the authorization to ordain through a messenger is the last of the
promulgations by the Buddha on the issue of _bhikkhunī_ ordination
recorded in the Theravāda _Vinaya_, its legal significance needs to

_Bhikkhunī_ Ordination  279


be ascertained by examining the narrative context that precedes it.
This brings to light that the first form of the ruling on ordination
by messenger reads "I _also_ authorize the giving of the higher ordination by messenger." The use of the term "also", _pi_, makes it
clear that this ruling is not meant to invalidate the rule on ordination by both communities.

Such an explicit indication is required, since both rules deal
with the same basic situation where an order of _bhikkhunī_ s is in
existence. In this respect these two rules differ from ordination by
_bhikkhu_ s only, which is valid because it concerns a basically different situation. In the present case of two rules that are based on
the same situation where an order of _bhikkhunī_ s is in existence,
the addition of "also" clarifies that the promulgation of ordination
by messenger does not invalidate ordination by both communities, that it is not the case that from this point onwards only higher
ordination by messenger is possible.

Thus all three types of procedure are equally valid and do not
conflict with each other, as together they address the following
possible situations:

  - a _bhikkhunī_ order is not in existence: ordination by _bhikkhu_ s

alone is the proper way to proceed;

  - a _bhikkhunī_ order is in existence and the candidate can safely

approach the _bhikkhu_ s: ordination by both communities is
required;

  - a _bhikkhunī_ order is in existence, but the candidate cannot

safely approach the _bhikkhu_ s: ordination by the _bhikkhunī_
community is to be followed by receiving ordination from
the _bhikkhu_ s through a messenger.
In this way, one rule regulates how to proceed at a time when
no _bhikkhunī_ order is in existence. Another rule regulates how the
higher ordination of female candidates should be undertaken when
a _bhikkhunī_ order is in existence and the female candidate can ap

280  _Vinaya_ Studies


proach the order of _bhikkhu_ s without putting herself in danger.
Yet another rule regulates how the higher ordination of female
candidates should be undertaken when a _bhikkhunī_ order is in
existence and the female candidate would put herself in danger
when attempting to approach the order of _bhikkhu_ s for higher
ordination.

However, according to Ajahn Ṭhānissaro (2001/2013: 449f),
the suggestion that the permission for _bhikkhu_ s to confer higher
ordination is not acceptable, as


this argument ignores the fact that the Buddha followed
two different patterns in changing Community transactions,
depending on the type of changes made. Only when totally
withdrawing permission for something he had earlier allowed … did he follow the pattern of explicitly rescinding the
earlier allowance …

When keeping an earlier allowance while placing new
restrictions on it, he followed a second pattern, in which he
merely stated the new restrictions for the allowance and gave
directions for how the new form of the relevant transaction
should be conducted in line with the added restrictions …

Because Cv.X.17.2, the passage allowing bhikkhus to give
full Acceptance to a candidate who has been given Acceptance
by the Bhikkhunī Saṅgha, simply adds a new restriction to the
earlier allowance given in Cv.X.2.1, it follows this second
pattern. This automatically rescinds the earlier allowance.


He concludes that "in the event that the original Bhikkhunī
Saṅgha died out, Cv.X.17.2 prevents bhikkhus from granting
Acceptance to women." Thus, according to his understanding,
with the disappearance of an order of _bhikkhunī_ s it becomes
impossible for _bhikkhu_ s to give the higher ordination to female
candidates. The reason is that the first rule that allows them to do


_Bhikkhunī_ Ordination  281


so has been implicitly rescinded by the promulgation of the subsequent rule on dual ordination. Such argument follows a basic
principle in law in general and in the _Vinaya_ in particular, where
the latest rule on a particular matter is the one that is valid and
which has to be followed. In a similar vein, Phra Payutto (2013:
58f and 71) argues that


when the Buddha prescribes a specific rule and then later
makes revisions to it … the most recent version of the rule is
binding. It is not necessary to say that previous versions have
been annulled. This is a general standard in the Vinaya … if
one were to assume that the original allowance for bhikkhus to
ordain bhikkhunis by themselves has been valid all along …
then later on in the Buddha's lifetime there would have also
been ordinations conducted solely by the bhikkhus … but this
didn't happen. Why? Because once the Buddha laid down the
second regulation the bhikkhus practiced accordingly and
abandoned the first allowance.


In short, the earlier ruling has been automatically rescinded by
the later ruling. The circumstance that this interpretation follows
an inner coherence and logic and is in line with a basic _Vinaya_
principle according to which the latest rule on a specific issue is
the valid one explains why the conclusion arrived at by these two
eminent _bhikkhu_ s has often been taken as the final word on the issue.

However, closer inspection shows that this is not just a case of
an early rule and its subsequent adaptation. Instead we have two
rules on related but distinct issues. This explains why after an
order of _bhikkhunī_ s had come into existence during the lifetime of
the Buddha there were no ordinations by _bhikkhunī_ s conducted
solely by _bhikkhu_ s. There can be only one situation at a time:
either a community of _bhikkhunī_ s is in existence, in which case
dual ordination is to be followed, or else a community of _bhik_ 

282  _Vinaya_ Studies


_khunī_ s is not in existence, in which case the allowance for _bhik_ _khu_ s to confer ordination on their own is to be followed. [117]

Since the belief in the impossibility of reviving an order of
_bhikkhunī_ s has such a long history in Theravāda circles, perhaps
an example may help to clarify the point at issue. Suppose a person regularly commutes from home to work via a highway that
connects two towns, and the municipal authorities have set a
speed limit of 100 km/h for this highway. Later on, this person
hears that the municipal authorities set another speed limit of 50
km/h. Even though the earlier limit of 100 km/h has not been
explicitly abolished, when caught by the police for driving at 80
km/h this person will not be able to argue that he or she had on
that day decided to follow the earlier speed-limit regulation. It is
not possible to assume that both limits are valid simultaneously
and one can freely choose which one to follow. The last speed
limit is the one that counts.
――――――
117 It seems Phra Payutto 2013: 60 has overlooked this aspect of the situation in

his discussion, when he raises the question "does this mean that both procedures are valid?", to which he then replies that "if one interprets that the first
procedure wasn't repealed … it is thus possible to choose between the two
procedures", which he rightly points out would be problematic. However, the
ordination by _bhikkhu_ s alone is only possible when a community of _bhikkhu_  _nī_ s is not in existence. As soon as such a community has come into existence
this is no longer possible, as then the second regulation applies. Another oversight by Phra Payutto 2013: 59 appears to be his suggestion that "the reason
why the Buddha didn't rescind the allowance for bhikkhus to ordain bhikkhunis is straightforward: the bhikkhus were still required to complete the
bhikkhuni ordinations." Yet, even if the earlier ruling had been rescinded, the
fact that the _bhikkhu_ s were allowed, or to be precise were expected, to participate in _bhikkhunī_ ordinations is explicitly stated with the reference to "the
community of _bhikkhu_ s" in the ruling at CV X 17.2: "I authorize the higher
ordination [of female candidates] in the community of _bhikkhu_ s for one who
has been higher ordained on one side and has cleared herself in the community of _bhikkhunī_ s."


_Bhikkhunī_ Ordination  283


The situation changes considerably, however, once closer investigation reveals that the second speed limit set by the municipal authorities was put up not by the highway, but in town. It refers to traffic in the town in which this person works; it does not
refer to the highway that leads up to this town. In that case, both
speed limits are valid at the same time. While driving on the highway, the speed limit is still 100 km/h, but when leaving the highway and driving into town to reach the workplace, the speed limit
of 50 km/h needs to be observed.

In the same way, the rules on single and dual ordination are
both valid. The second of these two does not imply a rescinding
of the first, just as the town speed limit does not imply a rescinding of the speed limit for the highway. Both rules are valid, as
they refer to two distinctly different situations.

In sum, the traditional belief that the Theravāda _Vinaya_ does
not enable a reviving of an extinct _bhikkhunī_ order seems to be
based on a reading of the relevant rules without full consideration of their narrative background. If studied in their narrative
context, it becomes clear that an extinct order of _bhikkhunī_ s can
indeed be revived by the _bhikkhu_ s, as long as these are not extinct as well. [118] As already stated by the Jetavan Sayādaw in
1949:


the Exalted One's statement: "Bhikkhus, I allow bhikkhus
to ordain bhikkhunīs" concerned … a period in the past when


――――――
118 Dhammananda 2010: 155 points out that the belief that the _bhikkhunī_ lineage

cannot be revived "disregards the allowance of the Buddha … in the _Culla_  _vagga_ of the Vinaya Piṭaka that monks can give ordination to women. It is
true that later the Buddha also allowed dual ordination … but the previous
allowance for a single saṅgha was never lifted." Bodhi 2009: 32 adds that
"the procedures for bhikkhunī ordination laid down in the Vinaya Piṭaka were
never intended to preclude the possibility of reviving a defunct Bhikkhunī
Sangha."


284  _Vinaya_ Studies


the Bhikkhunī Sangha did not exist; in the future, too, it will
be restricted to a period when the Bhikkhunī Sangha will not
exist; and at present it is restricted to a period when the Bhikkhunī Sangha does not exist …

when the Bhikkhunī Sangha is non-existent the occasion
arises for an allowance [given to] the Bhikkhu Sangha [to be
used], the Buddha laid down … that women can be ordained
by the Bhikkhu Sangha, that is: "Bhikkhus, I allow bhikkhus
to ordain bhikkhunīs." [119]


The interpretation proposed by the Jetavan Sayādaw offers a
more accurate reflection of the Pāli _Vinaya_ narrative than the positions taken by Phra Payutto and Ajahn Ṭhānissaro. The conclusion that emerges, after giving sufficient consideration to the narrative context of the two rules in question, is that it is possible to
revive an extinct order of _bhikkhunī_ s through ordination given by
_bhikkhu_ s alone.

This now raises the question of why, given that close inspection of the _Vinaya_ shows ordination by _bhikkhu_ s only to be a
valid form of restoring an extinct _bhikkhunī_ order, this option has
not been more widely recognized in the past. In order to appreciate this, in what follows I turn to the account in the _Dīpavaṃsa_ of
the beginnings of the _bhikkhunī_ order in Sri Lanka. As already
mentioned briefly above, according to the _Dīpavaṃsa_ the recently
converted king of Sri Lanka had requested _bhikkhu_ Mahinda to
confer ordination on Queen Anulā and her followers. The passage
in question proceeds as follows: [120] [Dīp 15.74–80]


The woman from a noble clan ( _khattiyā_ ) named Anulā
had firm faith in the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha,

she was of straight view
and had lost interest in becoming.


Having heard the words of the queen

[expressing her wish to go forth]
the king said this to the elder [Mahinda]:


"She has firm faith in the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha,
she is of straight view
and she has lost interest in becoming;
confer on Anulā the going forth!"


[Mahinda replied]:
"Great King, it is not allowable for a _bhikkhu_
to confer the going forth on a woman.


"My sister Saṅghamittā
will come here, o king;
having conferred the going forth on Anulā,
she will make her find release from all bondage.


"Saṅghamittā of great wisdom [will come],

[together with] Uttarā the discerning one,
Hemā and Māsagallā,
Aggimittā of measured speech,
Tappā and Pabbatachinnā,
Mallā and Dhammadāsiyā.


"These _bhikkhunī_ s
are concentrated and have shaken off lust,
their mental thoughts are pure
and they delight in the true Dharma and Vinaya.


"They have destroyed the influxes and attained [self-]control,

[they are endowed with] the three knowledges and skilled in
supernormal feats.


286  _Vinaya_ Studies


Being established in the highest,
they will also come here.


The _Dīpavaṃsa_ continues by reporting that Queen Anulā and
her followers did indeed receive ordination from Saṅghamittā and
her group of eminent _bhikkhunī_ s. [121] From the perspective of the
Theravāda _Vinaya_, this was indeed the proper procedure. Mahinda
and his _bhikkhu_ s could not just confer the higher ordination on the
queen and her followers, since in India an order of _bhikkhunī_ s was
in existence. This is why the queen and her followers had to wait
until Mahinda's sister Saṅgamittā and her group of _bhikkhunī_ s had
come.

As mentioned earlier, the order of Sri Lankan _bhikkhunī_ s that
had come into existence in this way appears to have become
extinct at some point in the early eleventh century during a period
of warfare and political turmoil in Sri Lanka. At that time even
the Sri Lankan _bhikkhu_ s were so hard-pressed that they had to
flee abroad.

Once peace had been restored and the _bhikkhu_ s returned from
being abroad, they would of course have realized that the order of
_bhikkhunī_ s had come to an end. When confronted with this situation, it would have been natural for them to turn to the account of
how the Sri Lankan order of _bhikkhunī_ s had come into being in
the first place.

Whereas the _Mahāvaṃsa_ is fairly short on this matter, [122] detailed information can be found in the _Dīpavaṃsa_ passage translated above. The _Dīpavaṃsa_ 's description, with its highlight on
the accomplished _bhikkhunī_ s who came to confer ordination, would
have made it appear highly desirable to find _bhikkhunī_ s to start
the order in Sri Lanka again. Since as far as we know at that time

_Bhikkhunī_ Ordination  287


no Theravāda _bhikkhunī_ order appears to have been in existence
outside of Sri Lanka, [123] this would not have been possible.

Given the statement by Mahinda that "it is not allowable for a
_bhikkhu_ to confer the going forth on a woman", it would not be
surprising if in such a situation the Sri Lankan _bhikkhu_ s were
under the influence of this wording when examining the relevant
portions of the _Vinaya_ on _bhikkhunī_ ordination. [124] The words of
the renowned arahant who according to tradition brought Buddhism to Sri Lanka would naturally have carried great weight.

Being influenced by Mahinda's authoritative statement could
easily lead to consulting the _Vinaya_ rules without fully taking into
account the significance of their narrative context. This would
then lead to the conclusion that the rule allowing _bhikkhu_ s to confer the higher ordination on _bhikkhunī_ s had been rendered invalid
by later rulings. Once such a perception had arisen and had been
passed on to subsequent generations, the weight of established
tradition and respect for one's teachers would have prevented


――――――
123 Cf. the detailed discussion in Skilling 1993: 36–38. Collins and McDaniel

2010: 1383 conclude that "there is no certain evidence for ordained _bhikkhu_  _nī_ -s anywhere in Southeast Asia at any time." Tsomo 2014: 345 sums up that
"there is no conclusive evidence that the lineage of full ordination for women
was established in Burma, Cambodia, Laos, Mongolia, Thailand, or Tibet."
124 In fact it might well be the same influence of Mahinda's statement that led to

the commentarial idea that a woman can only receive the going forth as a
_sāmaṇerī_ from a _bhikkhunī_, just as a man can only receive the going forth
from a _bhikkhu_ ; cf. Sp V 967,21: _purisaṃ hi bhikkhuto añño pabbājetuṃ na_
_labhati, tathā mātugāmaṃ bhikkhunito añño_ . This statement is without support in the _Vinaya_ itself, making it quite possible that it has its origin in the
reply by Mahinda to the king, reported in Dīp 15.76, Oldenberg 1879: 84,19:
_akappiyā, mahārāja, itthipabbajjā bhikkhuno_, even though this is not a generally valid statement, but much rather reflects the specific situation in Sri
Lanka at that time, where it was possible to bring _bhikkhunī_ s from India to
grant the going forth and the higher ordination to the queen and her followers.


288  _Vinaya_ Studies


closer enquiry. In this way it could be easily understood how the
firmly embedded belief arose among traditional Theravāda monastics that it is impossible to revive a _bhikkhunī_ order, once this
has become extinct, a belief that continues to be affirmed up to
the present day. [125]

In sum, given the historical circumstances of the transmission
and disappearance of the order of _bhikkhunī_ s in Sri Lanka, it is
not surprising if the _bhikkhu_ s should not have realized that they
could have started such an order anew on their own. Yet a close
study of the _Vinaya_ on its own terms, without allowing views and
opinions that have long been established in the tradition to exert
their influence, shows this possibility to be a legally valid option.

From a close study of the narrative on _bhikkhunī_ ordination as
reported in the Pāli _Vinaya_ it becomes clear that a revival of a defunct Theravāda _bhikkhunī_ order is possible. As far as I am able
to see, the interpretation that best makes sense of the various details
and circumstances reported in the Theravāda _Vinaya_ narrative
would be that the Buddha created an occasion for promulgating a
rule that enables the revival of a _bhikkhunī_ order that has become
extinct. [126]


――――――
125 A recent reiteration of this position can be found in Nandamālābhivaṃsa 2015:

28f, who states that "the impossibility for new bhikkhunī ordination is due to

[the] disappearance and non-existence of the _Bhikkhunī-saṅgha_ … as there is
no more _Bhikkhunī-saṅgha_ anymore, bhikkhunī ordination is impossible …
from the viewpoint of _Theravāda_, a revival of the _Bhikkhunī-sāsana_ could not
be possible anymore."
126 Needless to say, with this conclusion I do not intend to take a position on the

actual intentions of a historical person who lived in India some two and a half
millennia ago. Instead, the intentions I discuss are those of a person in Theravāda _Vinaya_ narrative, who in this text functions as the source of canonical
law. The intentions of the Buddha as depicted in the Pāli _Vinaya_ are crucial
for determining the legal consequences and implications of regulations concerning Theravāda monastic discipline and procedure.


_Bhikkhunī_ Ordination  289


This is in a way an advantage resulting from the fact that ordination of _bhikkhunī_ s is made dependent on _bhikkhu_ s. In contrast,
since the ordination of _bhikkhu_ s does not depend on _bhikkhunī_ s in
any way, an extinct order of _bhikkhu_ s can in turn not be revived
in a comparable manner.

Turning to the Tibetan tradition by way of comparison, from a
legal perspective ordination given by _bhikṣu_ s only, when an order
of _bhikṣuṇī_ s is not in existence, similarly can claim validity. In the
case of the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ this principle is enshrined in
its version of the _gurudharma_ on _bhikṣuṇī_ ordination, which stipulates that "a woman should expect from the _bhikṣus_ the going forth
and the higher ordination, the becoming of a _bhikṣuṇī_ ." [127]

The suggestion that the _gurudharma_ on _bhikṣuṇī_ ordination in
the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ can be relied upon as a legal basis
for reviving an order of _bhikṣuṇī_ s in the Tibetan tradition gathers
additional strength from the circumstance that this _gurudharma_ is
repeated in the Tibetan version of the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ .
This repetition occurs at the end of the description of how _bhik_ _ṣuṇī_ ordination should be carried out. The ordination being completed, the new _bhikṣuṇī_ (s) are to be taught some essential aspects
of moral conduct and etiquette, and it is in the context of these
teachings that the eight _gurudharma_ s should be repeated. [128] From

127 Schmidt 1993: 244,21 (§4b5). The Chinese version T 1451 at T XXIV 351a1

reads: "The _bhikṣuṇīs_ should seek from the _bhikṣus_ the going forth and the
higher ordination, the becoming of a _bhikṣuṇī_ ." This formulation is unexpected, because those who seek ordination from the _bhikṣu_ s could strictly
speaking not yet be called _bhikṣuṇī_ s themselves. The Tibetan version [[DN6]] _da_
102a7 or Q 1035 _ne_ 99b1 in fact speaks of "women", similar in this respect to
the Sanskrit version: "On receiving from the _bhikṣu_ s the going forth and the
higher ordination, women should well understand the condition of being a
_bhikṣuṇī_ ."

a legal perspective, the circumstance that the _gurudharma_ on ordination is found at this juncture makes it part of the latest procedure on ordination, instead of being a regulation that has been rescinded by the promulgation of ordination to be given by both
communities.

This has the intriguing result that the _gurudharma_ regulations,
often seen as emblematic of gender discrimination, turn out to
provide the much needed legal sanctioning of the full ordination
for female candidates in all of the three _Vinaya_ traditions still
extant today. The _gurudharma_ on ordination in the Dharmaguptaka _Vinaya_ seems to have provided the legal foundation for the
first ordinations of _bhikṣuṇī_ s in China. [129] The same _gurudharma_
in the Tibetan Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ offers a possibility of reviving the order of _bhikṣuṇī_ s in the Tibetan tradition. In the case
of the revival of the Theravāda _bhikkhunī_ order, again this _garu_ _dhamma_ has an important function, as it leads to a subsequent
ruling, resulting from the way this _garudhamma_ is formulated,
which provides the required legal basis.

In this way the dependence of the _bhikkhunī_ s on the _bhikkhu_ s
in the legal monastic texts, which implies a hierarchically inferior
position of ordained women vis-à-vis ordained men, is at the same
time what empowers a revival of an extinct _bhikṣuṇī_ order.

This complements a recurrent emphasis in academic and popular writings on the discriminating nature of the _gurudharma_ s. [130]
Without intending to deny that the _gurudharma_ s are discriminatory (as are other _Vinaya_ regulations), let alone approving of such
discrimination, I think it worthy of note that the very dependence

129 This holds even on the (in my view less probable) alternative interpretation

suggested above, according to which the acceptance of the eight _gurudharma_ s
would have provided the legal basis for ordination, in which case it is still the
very promulgation of the _gurudharma_ s that serves as the legal precedent.
130 Cf., e.g., Dhammadinnā 2016b.

on male monastics, enshrined in the _gurudharma_ s, offers the legal
basis for _bhikṣuṇī_ lineages in these three monastic traditions.


**Female Monasticism in Theravāda Countries**

In the final part of this chapter I examine the present-day situation of female monastics in Theravāda countries, to set a context
for the discussion on _bhikkhunī_ ordination.

Until recently, the only avenue for a Sri Lankan woman to become a nun was as a _dasasil mātā_ . The _dasasil mātā_ movement
goes back to the beginnings of the twentieth century when a Sri
Lankan nun took the precepts in the Burmese _thila shin_ tradition
(to which I turn below) and brought this tradition to Sri Lanka.

The dress of the _dasasil mātā_ s developed into its present form
of wearing ochre robes that are alike to monastic robes in colour,
but on closer inspection differ inasmuch as they are not made out
of the patchwork-style cloth worn by male novices and _bhikkhu_ s.
The way _dasasil mātā_ s usually take the ten precepts varies from
the way these are taken by the laity, but also from the way these
are taken by novices. [131] This reflects the fact that these nuns are
considered as standing somewhere in between the laity and monastics. [132]

――――――
131 Kusumā 1987/2010: 142f; on the taking of the precepts by _dasasil mātā_ s cf.

also Salgado 2004: 937–943.
132 Salgado 1997: 216 comments that "despite their renunciation of lay life, on

becoming nuns they do not abandon their role as nurturers as they become
_dasa sil mātās_ (ten-precept-mothers) and continue to be preparers of food";
on _dasasil mātā_ s and the ownership of monastic lands cf. also Salgado 2000.
Kusumā 1987/2010: xxi explains that "due to their unordained condition, the
_Dasasil Mātās_ are seen as a marginalized group in Sri Lanka today. They do
not belong to the Ordained Bhikkhunī, Sāmanerī or Sikkhamānā that the Buddha instituted. Neither do they belong to the lay community. Thus they are
torn between cultural norms of two divergent groups with the result that a

The Burmese _thila shin_ s, from which the _dasasil mātā_ tradition originated, similarly stand in an ambivalent position between
the lay and the monastic world. [133] They typically wear robes of a
pinkish colour that even from a distance distinguishes them from
_bhikkhu_ s and _sāmaṇera_ s, [134] and they usually do not officiate at
public ceremonies and seldom preach in public. [135] The _thila shin_ s
only go begging on specific days and receive alsm as uncooked
food, whereas Burmese _bhikkhu_ s can go begging any day and will

female Buddhist recluse is not obtained." On the _dasasil mātā_ s cf. also the
monograph studies by Bartholomeusz 1994 and Salgado 2013.
133 Kawanami 1990: 31 notes that "in general, monks address a _thilá-shin_ as

_tagamá_ (female donor), just as they would any other laywoman." According
to Kawanami 1990: 21, "the daily life of [a] _thilá-shin_ is centered around
merit-making activities that involve menial services to the religious community of the monks." Kawanami 1990: 34 points out that in general, "as for religious words and honorific verbs for eating, there is an interesting mixture of
religious and lay connotations for the nuns." Moreover, according to Kawanami 2013: 51, "becoming a monk is openly celebrated and praised, whereas
becoming a nun is generally disparaged by society." In fact, as noted by Kawanami 2013: 95, "a nun's celibate lifestyle seems to evoke a deep sense of
unease, which is neither celebrated nor seen as a 'heroic' … feat as it would
be for a celibate monk." Kawanami 2000b: 90f notes that " _thila-shin_ are
aware that theoretically they are not full members of the Buddhist Order.
Therefore, they feel that they are not fully entitled 'to receive' like the monks
and novices … the role of recipient [of gifts] for _thila-shin_ constantly reminds them of their ambiguous religious standing."
134 Kawanami 2013: 124 explains that for nuns there is a "decree issued in 1997

by the Supreme Sangha Council forbidding them to wear brown robes".
135 Kawanami 2000a: 166f notes that "certain religious roles and functions have

traditionally been closed to women. Officiating at a public ceremony is one
of them … preaching is another area of religious importance that is exclusively monopolized by monks in contemporary Myanmar … Burmese nuns
do preach and teach people about Buddhist ideas and philosophy, but mostly
in informal and private settings."

receive ready-made dishes. [136] According to Kawanami (1990: 25
and 27),


only a few _thilá-shin_ in Burma are able to follow all ten
precepts [which requires abstaining from the use of money].
To become a ten-precept _thilá-shin_, a woman has to have
either a wealthy family background or a highly successful
academic career … it may sound paradoxical, but to be in a
position of detachment, she must have sufficient resources and
backing to be able to afford it … a nun may save up her whole
donation income for the rest of the year to be able to abide by
the ten precepts during the three months of _Vassa_ .


In this way, compared to the _dasasil mātā_ s the _thila shin_ s appear to be in a less fortunate position. The situation of the _mae_
_chi_ s in Thailand seems to be still less fortunate in comparison, [137]


――――――
136 Carbonnel 2009: 269 adds that "the small amount of offerings nuns receive

… obliges them to increase the number of donors … in comparison, donations from four to five households are enough for monks to insure a sufficient
daily intake." Kawanami 2013: 129 reports that "some informants considered
a nun as unworthy of receiving donations due to her lack of official credentials." Kawanami 2013: 132 adds that "the relationship a nun maintains with
her lay benefactors is fundamentally different from that of a monk because of
the unofficial nature of her religious status." As a result, according to Kawanami 2013: 134 "the act of _dāna_ for a nun is a kind of gift-debt that has to be
eventually paid, and thus often results in her becoming locked into a relationship with her lay donor(s) … she becomes obliged often morally, to serve and
look after her patrons. Such dependence is not a situation that a nun initially
set out to achieve in her monastic life, but the social implications of an 'unreciprocated gift' eventually appear to catch up."
137 Barnes 1996: 268 notes that the " _mae ji_ are a group with serious problems.

However ambiguous the position of Sri Lanka's _dasa sil matavo_, they are …
very different from the _mae ji_ ." Brown 2001: 24 sums up the situation in
Thailand: "Thai women seeking to focus their lives on religion are in an entirely different situation than Thai men seeking to do the same."

even though they were apparently already in existence in the early
seventeenth century. [138]

The _mae chi_ s wear only white robes, [139] thus their appearance
is visually similar to that of the laity, except for the fact that they
have a shaven head. [140] A _mae chi_ usually takes only eight precepts at her ordination, which is considered a secular event. [141]


――――――
138 Skilling 1995; on the situation in Cambodia cf. Jacobsen 2013.
139 Lekshe Tsomo 1999: 14 points out that the _mae chi_ s "wear the white robes of

a layperson, receive little support, and enjoy little prestige". Ito 2006: 168
explains that "many Thai people associate the yellow robes only with male
Buddhist monks and novices, not with females. Thai people find it difficult to
imagine a woman taking the same yellow robes and duties as a monk"; on
how women are perceived in Thai rural society, which seems to make it indeed difficult imagining them in robes, cf. also Keyes 1984. Barnes 1996:
268 notes that "because _mae ji_ are not ordained they have no religious states
and … many monks consider them a nuisance."
140 Jordt 1988: 35 notes as a feature "of _mae-chii_ that the Sangha and the society

at large stress is the categorization of these women as members of the laity."
141 Falk 2000: 37 comments that "Thai nuns generally follow eight precepts", to

which Falk 2000: 48 and 50 adds that the "the ordination of _mae chis_ … is
conceived to be a secular event", it "is regarded as a lay ordination". Cook
2010: 149 depicts the situation of _mae chi_ s in between the lay and the monastic world in the following way: "when donating alms themselves _mae chee_
are more closely associated with the laity … because, like the laity, they donate alms _to_ the sangha." However, when "receiving alms _from_ the laity individually and on behalf of the monastic community as a whole, _mae chee_ are
necessarily associated _with_ the sangha." Falk 2008/2011: 102 sums up that
"they are not part of the prestigious _sangha_, nor do they belong to the lay
world … this gives nuns a marginalized position in society." In addition, Falk
2007: 12 also reports that, "in contrast to monks, the _mae chii_ s keep their lay
names after ordination … a sign of the Thai _mae chii_ s' ambiguous standing."
The contrast she draws in this respect does not seem to be entirely correct,
however, as some _bhikkhu_ s in Thailand also keep their lay names. Thus at
least in this respect the difference is not as pronounced as it might seem at
first sight.


_Bhikkhunī_ Ordination  295


Unlike _bhikkhu_ s, _mae chi_ s do not necessarily receive free
medical treatment, [142] in fact even at temples they are often expected to work for the food and shelter they receive. [143]

Nunneries housing _mae chi_ s usually lack important sacred
structures typical of a temple. [144] The government does not concede them the benefits of free travel, etc., accorded to _bhikkhu_ s,
yet they are also denied the right to vote, in line with the custom
that monastics do not vote. [145]


――――――
142 Brown 2001: 26 points out that "unlike monks, maēchī do not unquestionably

receive medical treatment for free or discounted rates." Seeger 2009: 813 notes
that, because of wearing white robes instead of monastic coloured robes, _mae_
_chis_ are expected to handle money. Thus according to one report "for women
who want to practise the ten precepts … this can be problematic … lay people
might suspect that _maechi_ s 'only' pretend to have no money"; cf. also Battaglia 2015: 36.
143 Ito 2004: 120 notes that "abbots and the laypeople who support the temple

often insist that a _mae chii_ contribute to the temple, because she lives for free
in the temple and eats the food that the community of laypeople intended for
monks … thus, a _mae chii_ in a temple is almost always expected to help cook
for monks and novices."
144 Falk 2007: 103f notes that nunneries "lack some of the significant and sacred

structures that are present at temples" for _bhikkhu_ s. A nunnery's "standing as
a monastic place cannot therefore rely on its buildings, but is dependent on
the order maintained and on the _mae chii_ s' daily activities … [it] could easily
turn into a lay place if religious practices are not upheld." In contrast, according to Nissan 1984: 33 Sri Lankan nunneries are "indistinguishable from any
town temple. The only difference is that they are inhabited by female rather
than male renouncers."
145 Falk 2007: 37 reports that "the authorities, too, treat the _mae chii_ s in ambigu
ous ways. The government supports the monks with free education, free medical care and free or reduced fares for buses and trains. _Mae chii_ s do not receive such support from the government on account of their official status as
laity. However, their ambiguous position becomes obvious when the same
government denies the _mae chii_ s the right to vote in public elections on the
basis of their renunciation of worldly matters"; cf. also Kabilsingh 1991: 38,


296  _Vinaya_ Studies


According to Falk (2007: 40 and 249),


the Thai _mae chii_ s' marginal position in the temples and
society is striking, although they have a long history in Thailand and have lived at the temples for centuries … [yet] the
_mae chii_ s' long history in Thailand has not granted them formal religious legitimacy. Their secondary standing in the religious field is further confirmed by their lack of support from
the Thai government and the Thai _sangha_ . The _mae chii_ s' ambiguous situation in society can be explained by their lack of
legal recognition as ordained persons and this has placed the
_mae chii_ s in a sort of official limbo.


However, the situation of _mae chi_ s has in recent times improved and through spiritual accomplishment or learning an individual _mae chi_ can nowadays rise to a position of considerable
eminence. [146]

The same appears to be the case in Burma. [147] The actual situation is thus complex, and it also needs to be kept in mind that _mae_

that two outstanding female lay meditation teachers in Thailand had no "husbands or families. They eschewed the normal roles of Thai women. They
lived like the women in white, _mæchi_, although they rejected this role because the generally low status of the _mæchi_ would have limited their ability
to lead lay groups." Cf. also, e.g., Barnes 1994: 139f and Mrozik 2009: 364.

_chi_ s or _thila shin_ s do not necessarily perceive themselves to be in
a situation of discrimination. [148]

Regarding the present situation for the recently revived order
of _bhikkhunī_ s in Sri Lanka, according to the report given by de
Silva (2004: 134),


now, with the restoration of the Bhikkhunī Saṅgha, the
nuns [ _bhikkhunī_ s] are becoming accepted … and are being
invited to perform … rituals that were previously performed
only by monks … [some] _bhikkhu_ s have also begun to appreciate the services of the _bhikkhunī_ s and … invite them to
the temple on full moon days to give Dhamma talks and to
lead meditations. [149]


Nevertheless, the option of taking higher ordination as a _bhik_  _khunī_ is not necessarily an attractive one for the _dasasil mātā_ s, or
else the _thila shin_ s and _mae chi_ s. [150] Although some are indeed

tent chanters." Nevertheless, according to Kawanami 2013: 127, "although
monastic education has allowed Myanmar nuns an upward mobile channel to
overcome various obstacles that have previously hindered their progress, the
category of Buddhist nuns remains ambiguous; they are still 'betwixt and between,' between the spiritual world of ordained monks and the secular domain of
the laity." In the words of Bonnet-Acosta 2014: 40 "these nuns are not officially
considered to be 'inside' the religion, but rather only 'related' to it."
148 Kawanami 2013: 7 notes that there is "a wide discrepancy between feminist

rhetoric on 'subordination' and the actual experience of Asian Buddhist nuns."
"Since many of the areas in which Asian Buddhist nuns exert their influence
appear to be in the 'domestic sphere', the outcome of their work has been accordingly undervalued by feminists trained mainly in Western discourses."

keen on changing their situation in this way, a substantial number
prefer to remain in their present setting. A problem here is that
their whole social relationship network with other nuns is based
on the principle of seniority, which on taking _bhikkhunī_ ordination would have to be restructured according to seniority in higher
ordination. [151]

Another and probably more weighty matter is the apprehension that, whatever form of harmonious co-existence they have
negotiated for themselves vis-à-vis the _bhikkhu_ s, this will have to
be re-negotiated. [152] In fact, if the _bhikkhu_ s are opposed to _bhik_ _khunī_ ordination, it may collapse entirely. [153] Needless to say,
_bhikkhu_ s who object to _bhikkhunī_ ordination may in turn influence lay supporters. In short, such a weighty step could adversely
affect the main pillars of the present life situation of these nuns.

tradition, where nuns are also not necessarily keen on higher ordination; cf.,
e.g., Hannah 2010.
151 Salgado 2013: 159 reports that some "junior nuns, however, out of loyalty to

their teachers … were hesitant to train as _bhikkhunis_ … for their potential ordination as _bhikkhunis_ would effectively render them senior to their teachers,
with whom they lived"; cf. also de Silva 2016.
152 Kawanami 2013: 235 reports from her research among _thila shin_ s that "when

made aware of the possibility of becoming _bhikkhunī_, the majority showed
reluctance to opt for a fully ordained status that could jeopardize the position
they already had in society and threaten the interdependent relationship they
had established with monks and lay supporters. On the other hand, there are
clear disadvantages to their present ambiguous standing, which, I have argued,
derive from the incomplete nature of their renunciation."
153 Sasson 2007: 61 comments that "for many of the _silmātās_, challenging mo
nastic authority carried with it the risk of losing the little bit of lay support
they might have managed to procure." Sasson 2010: 80 adds, "if women are
going to take on _upasampadā_ without the formal blessing of their government, the monks, or the laypeople they are surrounded by … they may be
risking their very ability to survive as monastics, for without socio-economic
support, monasticism is effectively impossible."


_Bhikkhunī_ Ordination  299


Moreover, being _bhikkhunī_ s they would become more dependent
on _bhikkhu_ s, something that may not always be desirable. In
addition to these practical problems, there also lurks the everpresent fear of the decline of the _sāsana_ . [154]

Recent developments in Sri Lanka help to reveal yet another
factor contributing to a lack of interest in _bhikkhunī_ ordination
among eight- and ten-precept nuns, especially in a setting where
such ordination is not yet fully available. Whereas earlier in Sri
Lanka the same attitude prevailed, the recent success of the _bhik_ _khunī_ order has attracted the attention of _dasasil mātā_ s, motivating
them to take a step in which they had earlier expressed no interest. [155]

This suggests that for eight- or ten-precept nuns the controversy
around the legality of _bhikkhunī_ s and the lack of public recognition
lead many to view _bhikkhunī_ ordination as not really a viable option. The very survival of a female mendicant in South and Southeast Asian Buddhist countries depends on the support offered by
the laity, which in turn is inexorably linked to the recipient of such
gifts successfully performing her or his role in accordance with
established values and traditional opinions. As long as becoming a

154 Bloss 1987: 19 reports that the _dasasil mātā_ s who are opposed to _bhikkhunī_

ordination reason that "the close relationship between _bhikkhus_ and
_bhikkhuṇīs_ might bring the downfall of a _sangha_ which they view as

[already] in decline." Bloss 1987: 22 also reports that _bhikkhu_ s he
interviewed about the _dasasil mātā_ s highlighted the Buddha's refusal to start
the order of _bhikkhunī_ s and his prediction of decline.
155 According to Salgado 2013: 13, "renunciants who were _sil matas_ in the 1980s

and were later given the _bhikkhuni upasampada_ had little if any interest in
receiving it at the outset"; cf. also above note 151 and Salgado 2013: 140ff;
and on the positive public image of _bhikkhunī_ s in Sri Lanka Mrozik 2014.
Thus it may well be that similarly _thila shin_ s and _mae chi_ s who at present
express their lack of interest will nevertheless take to higher ordination once
this becomes possible as a legally valid and generally recognized option.


300  _Vinaya_ Studies


_bhikkhunī_ is taken to be illegal and disreputable, it is unsurprising
that this step is viewed with considerable diffidence. [156]

In view of the importance of gender-equality discourses today,
it may nevertheless come as a surprise that Asian women do not
necessarily perceive their situation in these terms. In particular,
eight- or ten-precept nuns in Theravāda countries, who should in
theory most easily be able to appreciate the need to break free from
patriarchal oppression, refuse to view their condition in such terms
and at times even openly challenge feminist interpretations of
their situation. In fact a substantial portion of the eight- or tenprecept nuns are opposed to the revival of _bhikkhunī_ ordination
precisely because they see such attempts as motivated by an
agenda that is foreign to their own way of thinking and which
appears to them to stand in continuity with colonial attempts to
undermine their religious tradition. In a tradition which takes
pride in unswerving preservation of inherited customs and procedures, any suggested change is easily perceived as a threat.

Although efforts to promote this revival are often couched in
terms of promoting gender equality, the institution of the _bhik_ _khunī_ order as such is part of the much revered ancient Indian
heritage of Buddhism and thus certainly not something that is in
itself contrary to the Theravāda tradition. Nevertheless, opposition
against _bhikkhunī_ ordination among eight- or ten-precept nuns is
rooted in apprehensions towards agendas experienced as being in
dissonance with traditional Buddhist value systems and virtues.

Kawanami (2007: 238) describes the situation from her field
research in Myanmar in the following terms:


――――――
156 Ito 2014: 57f in fact identifies as two out of the three key factors for the suc
cess of the _bhikkhunī_ revival in Sri Lanka the fact that the first to take _bhik_  _khunī_ ordination were senior and respected _dasasil mātā_ s, making it easy for
the younger ones to follow their example, and the support the revival received
from senior and respected _bhikkhu_ s.


_Bhikkhunī_ Ordination  301


Burmese nun teachers I interviewed did not perceive the
recent revival of the _bhikkhunī_ lineage as something positive
that might bring new openings and affect their future in a
better way. Most saw it more as a challenge to the overall
unity of the Theravāda tradition and many perceived it as
threatening to what they have already achieved in society …
others … did not appreciate the emphasis on equal rights …
seeing such aspiration for status as 'self-serving' and 'selfobsessed'. One nun commented that it was an attack on their
carefully cultivated image of humility and moral purity, and
saw it go against her fundamental values and training.


In the case of Sri Lanka, Salgado (2013: 9, 10, and 29) sees a


_narrative disjunction_, in which a narrative provides frameworks for understanding the lives of nuns to which the nuns
themselves clearly do not subscribe … the dichotomies written
into narratives about nuns continue to make possible … the
repetition of the colonial event … the very notion that Asian
Buddhists need to engage a Buddhist feminism and yet are
incapable of so doing attests to an Orientalist discourse that
continues to pervade the scholarship on contemporary Buddhist nuns.


Cook (2010: 160f and 170) reports on Thailand, regarding the


subjugation of women and cultural backwardness bemoaned by scholars who focus on the domination of women
by men … what is striking and problematic about such approaches is the absolute rejection of such ideas by the _mae_
_chee_ with whom I work … [although one might argue] that
irrespective of the intent of the women involved we may analyse their practices in terms of their effectiveness in reinforcing or undermining structures of male domination. However,


302  _Vinaya_ Studies


such an analysis necessarily remains confined within an opposition of resistance and subordination that is not ethnographically relevant … it is a culturally particular understanding of
how power works, tied to an equally ethnocentric notion of
equality and 'liberation', and is inattentive to motivations and
desires that are not in accord with such theoretical principles
and imported political agendas.


The promotion of _bhikkhunī_ ordination in the name of gender
equality not only fails to hear the voice of a substantial number of
potential female monastics, it also is beset by the problem that
achieving the acceptance of such ordination within the tradition
will not fully accomplish the aim of gender equality. The reason
is that according to the Theravāda _Vinaya_ the status of _bhikkhunī_ s
is not equal to that of _bhikkhu_ s.

The achieving of full gender equality would only be possible
by creating an order of nuns independent of the Theravāda _Vinaya_
and tradition, thereby also inevitably missing out on much of the
support and respect that South and Southeast Asian Buddhists
might offer.

A disparity of status emerges right away with the first of the
_garudhamma_ s already taken up earlier, according to which a
_bhikkhunī_ invariably should pay respect to a _bhikkhu_, no matter
how long each of them has been ordained. [157] Monastic etiquette
prescribes that the paying of respect among _bhikkhu_ s takes place
according to age of ordination, with the junior _bhikkhu_ paying
homage to the elder. [158] The _garudhamma_ in question explicitly

158 Vin II 162,19 introduces the basic principle of rising up and paying homage

according to seniority. Right away the next passage, Vin II 162,26, mentions
women among those to whom such respect should not be accorded by a _bhikkhu_
and then states that respect should be accorded to those ordained earlier.


_Bhikkhunī_ Ordination  303


denies the application of the same principle across the male/female divide, in fact the Theravāda _Vinaya_ reports a reaffirmation
of the same stance by the Buddha in reply to a reported attempt
by Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī to have senior _bhikkhunī_ s receive respect from junior _bhikkhu_ s. [159]

Although this _garudhamma_ features regularly in gendersensitive writings, it needs to be kept in mind that from the
viewpoint of the Theravāda _Vinaya_ this is a less serious matter;
in fact an infringement of this _garudhamma_ carries no punishment, as noted above. A _bhikkhunī_ who decides not to act accordingly and who fails to pay homage to a _bhikkhu_ does not
commit an infringement of her main rules, but merely fails to
fulfil behavioural etiquette.

Before taking higher ordination, female candidates are expected to undergo a two-year probationary training that requires
keeping six out of the ten rules of a _sāmaṇerī_ without a breach. [160]
No such probationary training applies to male candidates for
higher ordination. Moreover, a _bhikkhunī_ is allowed to take the
central role in conferring ordination only for a single candidate
every two years. [161] No such restrictions apply to the ordination of
male candidates. Clearly there is a basic gender disparity built
into the ordination procedure. Even though not following these
――――――
159 Vin II 258,8.
160 According to Vin IV 319,33, a _bhikkhunī_ ordaining a female candidate who

has not completed the probationary training commits an offence requiring
confession.
161 Vin IV 336,18 prevents a _bhikkhunī_ from acting as preceptor in an ordination

every year. Vin IV 337,6 then stops her from ordaining more than one candidate in a year. J.-H. Shih 2000: 399 reasons that this would express a concern
"that the preceptress should be able to take full responsibility in training a
pupil", a comparable restriction for monks being found at Vin I 79,25, although in this case a later amendment allows a particularly qualified monk to
take more than one novice at a time; cf. Vin I 83,25.


304  _Vinaya_ Studies


stipulations does not invalidate the higher ordination of a _bhik_ _khunī_, it does result in an offence.

The rules for a _bhikkhunī_ involve several regulations that are
considerably more demanding than in the case of _bhikkhu_ s (although it needs to be noted that in some respects the rules for
_bhikkhu_ s are more demanding). The second most serious type of
breach of a rule for fully ordained monastics is a _saṅghādisesa_
offence, which results in temporary suspension. A _bhikkhunī_ can
commit such a serious breach through the mere fact of travelling
alone, without a companion. [162]

For _bhikkhu_ s there are four _pārājika_ s, offences that entail loss
of one's monastic status, but there are eight for _bhikkhunī_ s. One of
the additional _pārājika_ offences applicable only to the case of
_bhikkhunī_ s comes about if, being under the influence of lust, she
consents to being touched by a lustful male at any place of her
body between her collarbones and knees. [163] In comparison, for a
_bhikkhu_ to commit a _pārājika_ offence through lustful behaviour
requires that he intentionally engage in sexual intercourse. [164]
Having lustful physical contact with a female is only a _saṅghādi_ _sesa_ offence for a _bhikkhu_ . [165]


――――――
162 According to Vin IV 229,35, a _bhikkhunī_ right away commits an offence in
volving temporary suspension if she goes alone into a village, crosses a river
alone, is alone at night, or remains behind alone when being with a group (during a journey). This rule would have originally evolved out of a concern to
protect _bhikkhunī_ s, given that elsewhere the _Vinaya_ reports that _bhikkhunī_ s
were raped when finding themselves precisely in the type of situation that this
rule intends to avoid. No comparable travel restrictions exist for _bhikkhu_ [[SN163]] Vin IV 213,34 indicates that a _bhikkhunī_ commits an offence involving loss

of her monastic status if, being herself lustful, she consents to being touched,
stroked, grabbed, fondled, or squeezed in the area between her collarbones
and her knees by a lustful man.
164 Vin III 23,33; cf. above p. 7ff and 35ff.
165 Vin III 120,33.


_Bhikkhunī_ Ordination  305


Whereas the irgnoring the _garudhamma_ regarding paying respect would not carry legal consequences and even the proper
procedure to be adopted for _bhikkhunī_ ordination is not always
followed, there seems to be considerably less room to overlook
rules of the _saṅghādisesa_ and _pārājika_ type, as the very act of
ordaining as a _bhikkhu_ or _bhikkhunī_ is an expression of one's
willingness to train according to these rules. In short, achieving
ordination as a Theravāda _bhikkhunī_ will not result in a situation
of equality vis-à-vis _bhikkhu_ s and will not be able to satisfy fully
standards of gender equality. [166]

In fact admission to the monastic community is not based on a
concern with granting equal opportunities to all, as it involves discrimination. According to the stipulations in the Theravāda _Vinaya_,
mentioned above, those afflicted with certain diseases are barred
from entry just as those who do not fulfil certain sexual norms.

In this way, the final goal of creating an order of _bhikkhunī_ s in
accordance with the Theravāda _Vinaya_ will not result in a situation of full equality when compared to their male counterparts.


**Conclusion**

The controversy regarding the revival of _bhikkhunī_ ordination
can at times turn into a clash between two ideological constructs,
which oppose each other in a way that can be compared to a positive and a negative image in photography. The positive image is
the revived _bhikkhunī_ line, representative of gender equality and a
globalized Buddhist sisterhood; the negative image is the absence


――――――
166 However, Ashiwa 2015: 32 goes in my view too far in concluding that "the

restoration of nun discipline will … bring another discrimination against
women within the framework of precepts that will not result in the improvement of the status of Buddhist women." Although full gender equality is not
possible within the _Vinaya_ framework, the restoration of _bhikkhunī_ ordination
still brings about a clear improvement of the status of Buddhist women.


306  _Vinaya_ Studies


of _bhikkhunī_ (s), an emblem of a pure religious tradition successfully safeguarded against Western interference.

One can hardly question the need for women to be granted
equal opportunities. Avoiding the infliction of unnecessary suffering through discrimination not only reflects Western values, but
also speaks to the very heart of Buddhist doctrine. This makes the
quest to improve the situation of women one that should naturally
find support among all those who consider themselves followers
of the Buddha.

At the same time, however, the right of religious traditions to
maintain their customs and observances has to be acknowledged.
The Theravāda tradition has been deeply influenced by the perceived need to protect religion against Western colonial arrogance
and more recently the disintegrating influences of secularism,
similarly seen as originating predominantly in the West. In view
of this historical precedent, reviving a _bhikkhunī_ order in ways
that openly conflict with basic Theravāda legal principles can
easily be interpreted as the shadow of past colonial arrogance and
the continuation of the disintegrating influences of secularization.

Values that in themselves are indubitably positive can become
problematic when they are affirmed as the only relevant factor
that deserves attention to the extent of ignoring the complexity of
the situation. In this way they can turn into self-perpetuating ideological constructs that render their staunch proponents incapable
of entering into dialogue with those who do not adhere to the
same ideology.

The rhetoric of women's empowerment becomes an act of
disempowerment when it ignores the voices of those on whose
behalf it intends to speak. Similarly, the rhetoric of defending
tradition can actually undermine the tradition when it ignores the
spirit of the Buddha's teaching for the sake of the letter, based on


_Bhikkhunī_ Ordination  307


a selective reading of the legal code that turns a blind eye to its
intentions as evidenced by the narrative context.

Full appreciation of the complexity of the situation would require that proponents of the revival of _bhikkhunī_ ordination acknowledge the legal problems. They would also need to take on
board the resistance of eight- or ten-precept nuns to feminist
agendas, as well as the fact that the revival of the Theravāda
_bhikkhunī_ order will not achieve true gender equality. Even the
way to revive the _bhikkhunī_ order through single ordination by
_bhikkhu_ s confirms its dependence on males, instead of standing
out as an affirmation of women's agency. Yet, to promote dual
ordination instead ignores the legal problems that this involves
and the inevitable resistance this must cause among traditionalists. Such promotion can even appear to confirm the suspicions of
a foreign agenda that is being insensitive to the needs and priorities of the tradition of which one wishes to be part.

In the same way, traditionalists affirming the critical importance of adherence to the rules in the Pāli _Vinaya_ as the very heart
of Theravāda monastic life and identity need to keep in mind the
mandate for compassion and avoidance of harm as a central Buddhist value. In addition, they need to revisit the common belief
that the _Vinaya_ does not permit reviving a _bhikkhunī_ order. Contrary to their assumptions, the Theravāda _Vinaya_ indicates that
this is possible.


## **Appendix 1: Paṇḍaka**

**Introduction**

In my translation of CV X 17.1 in the previous chapter, I have
not translated the term _paṇḍaka_ in the compound _itthipaṇḍaka_ .
Since a survey of relevant Pāli passages and the contributions that
to my knowledge have been made by other scholars on the significance of the term would have resulted in too long a footnote, I
have shifted this discussion to the present appendix.


**The Significance of the** _**Itthipaṇḍaka**_

Horner (1952/1975: 375) renders the term _itthipaṇḍaka_ in the
plural as "female eunuchs" and Upasak 1975: 48 in the singular as
"she-eunuch". The Pāli commentary on CV X 17.1 is of no real
help, as it glosses the _itthipaṇḍaka_ as _animittā_ . [1] Yet the _animittā_
has already been mentioned as the first in the list of the twentyfour stumbling blocks for receiving _bhikkhunī_ ordination, from
which the _itthipaṇḍaka_ mentioned as eighth would have to differ
in order to merit being explicitly mentioned. [2]

For the male _paṇḍaka_, several scholars have opted for the
rendering "eunuch", [3] which according to Wezler (1998: 263)
would suit the etymology of the term. Given that according to

cautions that "the word _paṇḍaka_ has a wider meaning than 'eunuch' as usually
understood"), and Kieffer-Pülz 2013: 1777.


310  _Vinaya_ Studies


Perera (1993: 141) "the castrated eunuch … was an alien factor in
ancient Indian sex life", [4] in the ancient Indian context a "eunuch"
could only refer to those who have come to be in this condition
due to a congenital defect or an accident. A _Vinaya_ passage distinguishes in fact between three types of _paṇḍaka_, which could be
human, non-human, and animal. [5] This presentation can safely be
assumed not to refer to celestial or animal "eunuchs".

Another _Vinaya_ passage describes an actual _paṇḍaka_ approaching various males, monastic and lay, [440] asking them to have sex
with him. [6] This passage shows the _paṇḍaka_ as engaging in passive homosexual activity.

Elsewhere in the _Vinaya_ the _paṇḍaka_ occurs in lists. Here the
_paṇḍaka_ features alongside men, women, and hermaphrodites in
an attempt to present an exhaustive account of potential partners
for sex. [7] As pointed out by Kieffer-Pülz (2013: 1778), the fact
that the _paṇḍaka_ here stands in contrast to the hermaphrodite,
who has the sexual characteristics of both men and women,
makes it probable that it refers to someone without the sexual
characteristics of men or women.

Another such list in the _Vinaya_ considers the possibility of
mistaking a woman for a _paṇḍaka_, followed by the possibility of
mistaking a man for a _paṇḍaka_, and then a _paṇḍaka_ for being
either a man or a woman. [8] This would fit an understanding of the
significance of the term, when used in the _Vinaya_, as referring to
someone without the sexual characteristics of both men and
women.

Turning to canonical Abhidharma literature, the _Kathāvatthu_
indicates that a _paṇḍaka_ is unable to ejaculate, [9] based on which
Likhitpreechakul (2012) concludes that a _paṇḍaka_ is someone
impotent due to seminal deficiency.

With later texts the implications of the term broadened. According to Perera (1993: 142), "the term _paṇḍaka_ was extended
from … the congenital eunuch … to embrace all other categories
of sexual weaklings."

Based on the definition given of the term in exegetical literature, Zwilling (1992: 205) argues that the notion of the _paṇḍaka_
includes those who are able to have an erection or ejaculate. [10] [441]
In reply to this suggestion, Kieffer-Pülz (2013: 1779f note 31)
clarifies that in the definition of the _opakkamikapaṇḍaka_ in the
_Samantapāsādikā_ the qualification _bījāni apanītāni_ does not imply the ability to ejaculate, [11] as _bīja_ elsewhere refers to testicle instead of semen, which would rather be _sukka_ or _asuci_ .

The same listing of types of _paṇḍaka_ in the _Samantapāsādikā_
also includes a _pakkapaṇḍaka_, [12] who is only in the condition of
being a _paṇḍaka_ during half of the month. This could hardly be a
eunuch, wherefore Kieffer-Pülz (2013: 1780) introduces this and
two other types of _paṇḍaka_ as sexual deviants who are not necessarily eunuchs. [13]

A listing of _paṇḍaka_ s in the _Nāradasmṛti_ 12.10–13, discussed
in Syed (2003: 82f), also covers several types who are not just im

unfamiliar with this type as we are today."

who are eunuchs as well as persons with peculiar psycho-sexual problems."

potent. Syed concludes that in this text a _paṇḍaka_ is basically a
male who is sexually abnormal, which could be due to psychological or physical reasons. [14]

Gyatso (2003: 108) suggests that the fact that a _paṇḍaka_ is
barred from ordination relates to the difficulty of clearly defining
its nature in contrast to the _Vinaya_ ’s general concern with exact
definition. Yet for a celibate single-sex monastic community it
seems obvious to prevent entrance into its order of members who
are suspected to be prone to same-sex activities (as evident in the
_Vinaya_ passage mentioned earlier where a _paṇḍaka_ asks monks to
have sex with him) [15] or who are in some way crippled or abnormal.

[442] [ In addition to the problem of affecting public image, duly ]
noted by Gyatso (2003: 109), [16] the whole set of rules and modes
of conduct, prescribed in the _Vinaya_ to prevent privacy with the
other sex in order to forestall possible breaches of celibacy, shows
the importance given to physical segregation. The exclusion of
the _paṇḍaka_ from ordination would only be a logical extension of
such concerns, without any need to be motivated by the problem
of clearly defining the _paṇḍaka_ .

Turning to the case of female _paṇḍaka_ s, Zwilling (1992: 208)
suggests that the _itthipaṇḍaka_ would be a lesbian. [17] Harvey 2000/
2005: 415 argues that "just to equate the female _paṇḍaka_ with a
lesbian is problematic" because the _itthipaṇḍaka_ is "clearly seen
as having some organic abnormality of the uterus", in support of

which he then refers to the passage found at CV X 17.1. [18] This
appears to be a misunderstanding, as the reference to uterine
prolapse (seventh stumbling block) in CV X 17.1 does not qualify
the _itthipaṇḍaka_ (eighth stumbling block), but rather refers to a
different type of female that is also barred from higher ordination.

Likhitpreechakul (2012: 118 note 121) considers the female
_paṇḍaka_ to be "a biological female who lacks the female equivalent of semen (the female hormones estrogens/progesterone in
modern terms)". According to Kieffer-Pülz (2013: 1778 note 26),
an _itthipaṇḍaka_ could be the result of an underdevelopment of the
ovary.

In view of the ambivalence of the term, I have decided to retain the original term _paṇḍaka_ in the translation in the previous
chapter. [19]

## **Appendix 2: Fǎxiǎn**

**Introduction**

The complexity of the situation surrounding the early stages of
the order of nuns in China can best be appreciated in the light of
the dearth of _Vinaya_ texts during the beginnings of the Chinese
monastic order. In order to provide additional information on the
dynamics influencing this situation, the present appendix presents
a spotlight on one of the chief protagonists in the transmission of
_Vinaya_ texts to China, the pilgrim Fǎxiǎn (法顯).

The network of paths and routes connecting Northwest India,
Central Asia, and China during the first millennium of the present
era, known as the "Silk Road", played a central role in the spread
of Buddhism to China and in the transmission of Buddhist scriptures. [1] The early stages of this transmission of Buddhism via the
Silk Road took place mainly through the medium of Indians and
Central Asians who travelled to China, but soon enough the Chinese responded with a series of pilgrimages to the Central Asian
and Indian territories. [2] The first among the Chinese pilgrims that
undertook the strenuous and hazardous journey via Central Asia
to reach the homeland of Buddhism, [58] and whose travel records
have been preserved, was Fǎxiǎn. [3]

**Fǎxiǎn's Pilgrimage**

According to the records of his journey, [4] at a time corresponding to the year 399 of the present era Fǎxiǎn set out from Cháng'ān
(長安) with a group of companions. [5] His pilgrimage took him via
Dūnhuáng to Khotan. [6] Proceeding over difficult mountain paths,
he reached Takṣaśīla, [7] and eventually Mathurā. [8] By the time he
arrived in the Indian 'Middle Country', the Madhyadeśa, [9] Fǎxiǎn
had already spent several years on the road. He had crossed deserts and mountains, some of his companions had turned back and
two had died along the way. [59]

Fǎxiǎn visited the main locations related to the Buddha's life
and teaching, such as Sāvatthī, which he found to be only sparsely
populated, [10] and Kapilavatthu, which at the time of his arrival was

"India found itself occupying a unique place in the Chinese world order: a foreign kingdom that was culturally and spiritually revered as equal to the Chinese civilization."
10 According to T 2085 at T LI 860b9, at the time of Fǎxiǎn's visit, Sāvatthī was

inhabited by only about two hundred families.

after an excursion to Rājagaha and Gayā, [12] he stayed for a period
of three years in order to study the Indian language and script so
as to be able to copy and eventually translate Buddhist scriptures. [13]

According to his own account, Fǎxiǎn had undertaken the long
and hazardous journey to India in order to search for _Vinaya_ texts. [14]
While still in China, he had been acutely aware of the incomplete
state of the _Vinaya_ material that had so far been translated into
Chinese, [60] and it was in order to improve this situation that he
had decided to set out on his journey. [15]

Although his chief motivation was to "search for _Vinaya_ ", the
records of his journey make it clear that Fǎxiǎn was at the same

"there was, at the time, a large number of voices bewailing the incompleteness
of canonical codes, so much so that any member of the foreign saṅgha who
was proficient in the Vinaya would, upon arrival in China, become the object
of veneration and expectation simultaneously. Tao-an's efforts, before this
time, to secure a canonical code … [and] Hui-yüan's dispatch of Chih Fa-ling
and others to Central Asia was … motivated by the same considerations."
Char 1991: 39 sums up that in general "the lack of Indian texts to translate
into Chinese … induced the Chinese monks to travel to India in search of the
original texts", thus in the case of Fǎxiǎn, as noted by Lévy 1995: 61, "le but
principal qu'il avait assigné à son voyage était de rapporter des textes plus
complets sur la discipline monastique"; cf. also Li 2016: 40. The 高僧傳, T

quest in terms of seeking both _sūtra_ s and the rules of discipline, 經律. Shih

the circumstance that the material brought back by Fǎxiǎn included several

Buddha and the chief events in the Buddha's life. In fact his search
for _Vinaya_ cannot be neatly separated from such interests, as from
the perspective of Fǎxiǎn and his contemporaries both would have
been experienced as related facets of the same undertaking. For
Fǎxiǎn, a search for _Vinaya_ would have meant a combination of
first-hand experience of _Vinaya_ practice and religious customs in
India with a quest for written materials that could be taken back
to China for translation. [16] [61]

The importance of his primary motivation to serve the progress
of Buddhism in his home country came to the fore when the last of
his original travel companions, Dàozhěng (道整), decided to stay in
India. The favourable conditions in India and the good _Vinaya_ standards of the Indian monks had made such a strong impression on
Dàozhěng that he decided to settle in India instead of returning to

China; in fact he even formulated the aspiration to never be reborn
in a border country (like China) until his eventual attainment of
Buddhahood. [17] For Fǎxiǎn, however, the call of his original mission to bring the _Vinaya_ to his home country was a strong motivating force, [62] which made him decide that he would continue his
journey alone. [18]

Until his arrival in Pāṭaliputta, the chief purpose of Fǎxiǎn's
pilgrimage had not found fulfilment, as he had been unable to obtain manuscripts that could be taken back to China for translation.
A central reason for his difficulties was that oral transmission still
continued alongside writing. [19] In the case of his search for _Vinaya_
manuscripts in particular, another contributing factor would have
been that it was apparently considered inappropriate to divulge
_Vinaya_ material to outsiders, making it less likely that a foreigner
would easily come across _Vinaya_ manuscripts that he could copy. [20]

On arriving in Pāṭaliputta, however, Fǎxiǎn finally found what
he had been searching for, as in a local monastery he was able to
procure several texts that he could copy. [63] According to the list

ing given in his travel records, among these texts were two _Vinaya_ s,
namely a Mahāsāṅghika _Vinaya_ and a Sarvāstivāda _Vinaya_, [21] the
second of which was still transmitted by way of oral recitation.

After his three-year period of study and copying of texts in
Pāṭaliputta, Fǎxiǎn continued to the east coast to the mouth of the
Ganges, where he stayed another two years to copy _sūtra_ s and
draw pictures of statues. From there he embarked for Ceylon,[64]
where he remained for another two years, staying at the Abhayagiri monastery. During his stay, Fǎxiǎn was able to further extend
his manuscript collection, as he obtained a Mahīśāsaka _Vinaya_
and other texts. [22]

With his collection of manuscripts, Fǎxiǎn finally embarked
for China by boat. His return proved to be as adventurous as his
earlier journey overland, since he twice faced near shipwreck. [23]
On the first of these two occasions the other passengers, most of
whom were merchants, threw all kinds of goods into the sea in
order to prevent the ship from sinking. Thus Fǎxiǎn faced the dire
prospect of having to throw his precious manuscripts as well into
the water. Fortunately, however, the ship reached an island where
it could be repaired, so that the manuscripts that Fǎxiǎn had col

lected with so much effort were saved from being thrown into the
sea.

To complete his journey he embarked on another ship, which
went off course during a storm. Brahmin passengers believed the
presence of a Buddhist monk on board to be inauspicious and,
had it not been for the timely intervention of another passenger,
Fǎxiǎn would have been marooned on some desert island along
the way, together with his manuscripts. When after all these adventures Fǎxiǎn finally arrived in China, [65] together with his
precious manuscripts, he had been away for fifteen years. [24]


**Fǎxiǎn's** _**Vinaya**_ **manuscripts**

From the perspective of his principal quest for _Vinaya_ manuscripts, Fǎxiǎn's journey had been quite successful, since he had
brought copies of altogether three _Vinaya_ s to China. [25] Fǎxiǎn
himself translated the Mahāsāṅghika _Vinaya_ he had obtained in
Pāṭaliputta, a translation undertaken in collaboration with the
Indian Buddhabhadra during the period 416 to 418 CE. [26] The
Mahīśāsaka _Vinaya_ he had brought from Ceylon was translated
after he had passed away, during the period 423 to 424 CE by a
team under Buddhajīva, a monk from Kashmir, in collaboration
with the Khotanese monk Zhìshèng (智勝). [27]

322  _Vinaya_ Studies


The manuscript of the Sarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ that Fǎxiǎn had
also brought from Pāṭaliputta was not translated. [66] The reason
was that during the period 404 to 409 CE a translation of a Sarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ had already been undertaken in China. [28] The
famous Kumārajīva had begun to translate this _Vinaya_, based on a
text recited from memory by *Puṇyatarā. But when the translation was still far from being completed, *Puṇyatarā passed away.
Kumārajīva was able to take up the translation again when a written copy of the Sarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ was brought to China by
*Dharmaruci. Before the revision of the translation had been
completed, however, Kumārajīva also passed away.

During the time of the rather eventful translation of this Sarvāstivāda _Vinaya_, Fǎxiǎn was still on his pilgrimage, so that he
could not have known that a version of the _Vinaya_ he was busily
copying in Pāṭaliputta was already being translated in China. [67/84]

In sum, Fǎxiǎn's travels reveal an intriguing aspect of the
transmission of Buddhism via the Silk Road, which involved the
adventurous journeys of Indians, Central Asians, and Chinese for
the sake of the spread and propagation of the Dharma. Among
these undertakings, the pilgrimage by Fǎxiǎn in quest of _Vinaya_
texts for the monastic communities in China is a remarkable testimony to the difficulties and the success of the transmission of
Buddhism from India to China. At the same time, his efforts help to
appreciate the background of the early stages in the growth of Chinese monasticism. [85]

## **Appendix 3: Āsava**

**Introduction**

In the context of elaborating on the first _pārājika_, the different
_Vinaya_ s offer a succinct indication regarding the purposes that
motivate the promulgation of monastic rules. According to this
indication, the restraint and eventual removal of the _āsava_ s form a
guiding principle in this respect. [1]

Although in the case of the _Vinaya_ rules this is not immediately evident with each and every case, and I would not want to
claim that every rule, as it has come down to us, invariably fulfils
this purpose, it does seem that tradition considers the overarching
purpose of the _Vinaya_ rules to be countering the influxes and that
this is the principle that underpins them. [2] This in turn makes an

contains only an extract from the original article.
1 [61] The pronouncement of the first _pārājika_ regulation is preceded in Vin III

21,19 by an indication that two of its ten purposes are to restrain present influxes
and prevent future ones, _diṭṭhadhammikānaṃ āsavānaṃ saṃvarāya, sampa_ _rāyikānaṃ āsavānaṃ paṭighātāya_ . Similar formulations can be found in the

the influxes", _āsavaṭṭhāniyā dhammā_, as the reason for the promulgation of

appreciation of the significance of the term _āsava_ a meaningful
consideration for understanding the normative motivation associated with Buddhist monastic law.


**The Destruction of the Influxes**

The destruction of the influxes, _āsavakkhaya_, is a recurrent expression in the early discourses to denote the attainment of the final goal of full liberation. A standard presentation distinguishes
the influxes to be eradicated into three types:

  - the influx of sensuality,

  - the influx of becoming,

  - the influx of ignorance. [3]
More information for appreciating the practical implications
and the significance of the term _āsava_ can be gathered from the
_Sabbāsava-sutta_ and its parallels which, with minor variations, [4]
present seven methods for overcoming the influxes. In the Pāli
listing these are:

  - seeing ( _dassana_ ),

  - restraining ( _saṃvara_ ),

  - using ( _paṭisevana_ ), [81]

  - enduring ( _adhivāsana_ ),

  - avoiding ( _parivajjana_ ),

  - removing ( _vinodana_ ),

  - developing ( _bhāvanā_ ).
The main implications of these seven methods are:

  - seeing the four noble truths instead of useless speculation,

  - guarding the sense-doors,

rules; on the reading in the parallel [[MA194]] at T I 749a14 cf. Anālayo 2011b:

3 [55] The notion of a fourth _āsava_ of views appears to be a later addition to the

threefold presentation; cf. in more detail Anālayo 2011b: 382 note 217.

Appendix 3: _Āsava_  327


  - using one’s requisites properly,

  - enduring various hardships,

  - avoiding what is dangerous and unsuitable,

  - removing what is unwholesome,

  - developing the awakening factors.
The circumstance that each of these activities is explicitly and
directly related to the removal of the influxes reflects a notion of
the _āsava_ s that has a more general sense than the enumeration of
three influxes mentioned above. This thereby helps to relate the
idea of overcoming the influxes to the type of monastic life situations usually depicted in _Vinaya_ literature.

Another noteworthy aspect of the present exposition relates to
an understanding of the significance of the term _āsava_ . In a passage in the _Aṅguttara-nikāya_, _āsava_ stands for the discharge from
a festering sore and thus for something that flows out. [5] But this
does not seem to be the sense appropriate for the activities listed
above, which appear to be about something flowing in, if one can
speak of a flow at all.

The notion of an inflow becomes particularly evident with the
practice of sense-restraint, which according to the standard exposition in the Pāli discourses is concerned with avoiding the
"flowing in", _anvāssavati_, of what is detrimental. [6] The close relationship of this expression to the term _āsava_ is obvious, wherefore the practice of "restraining" the senses in the _Sabbāsava-_
_sutta_ and its parallel is clearly not a case where _āsava_ has the
meaning of an "outflow" and therefore does not stand in contrast

5 [57] [[AN3.26]] at AN I 124,8 uses the expression _āsavaṃ deti_ .
6 [58] Cf., e.g. [[MN27]] at MN I 180,30: _pāpakā akusalā dhammā anvāssaveyyuṃ_ .

[[MN2]] at MN I 10,3 and its parallel [[MA10]] at T I 432b13 then reckon sense-restraint to be how "influxes should be removed through restraint", _āsavā saṃ_  _varā pahātabbā_, 漏從護斷, clear evidence for the close relationship between
_anvāssavati_ and _āsava_ .


328  _Vinaya_ Studies


to the sense of "inflow" with which the same term is invested in
Jain usage.

Rather, sense-restraint appears to be concerned with avoiding
the 'influence', as a psychologically conceived 'flowing in' that
need not involve a material substance, of external detrimental factors on the mind. Such avoiding of detrimental influences on the
mind would be very much in line with a general tendency of early
Buddhist soteriology not to approach the notion of purification in
a material sense, [82] but rather to give overall importance to purity
of the mind. There seems therefore to be no real need to assume
that the term _āsava_ must be a maladapted borrowing of Jain terminology. [7] Schmithausen (1992: 125f) explains that


_ās(r)ava_ may, in Buddhist texts … also denote annoyances,
trouble, suffering … in the case of _ās(r)ava_ the most archaic
meaning is 'dangers' or 'disturbances' rushing or intruding
upon the ascetic. [8]


According to Tatia (1993: 5), in Jain usage


the expression _āsava_ is used in the sense of hardship to be
borne by an ascetic … this is also exactly the meaning of the
――――――
7 [59] Jacobi 1914: 472 argues that "the Buddhists have borrowed … the most sig
nificant term _āsrava_ … from the Jains." Norman 1997: 34 reasons that "the
etymology of this word (the preposition _ā_ 'towards' + the root _sru-_ 'to flow')
implies something flowing in, and this suits the Jain usage well, since there the
_āsavas_ are influences which flow into a person and discolour his soul"; but this
sense "does not suit the Buddhist idea, where the _āsavas_ are not attributes which
are capable of flowing into a person". Gombrich 2009: 56 comments that "the
Pali word _āsava_ corresponds to Sanskrit _āsrava_, a noun from the verb _ā-sru_, 'to
flow in' … but the term makes no sense, as in Buddhism there is nothing which
'flows in' on one. On the other hand, that is precisely how the Jains envisage the
operation of karma."
8 [60] My ignorance of Japanese has prevented me from benefitting from the re
search by Fumio Enomoto on _āsava_, listed in Schmithausen 1992: 145f.


Appendix 3: _Āsava_  329


Pāli word _āsava_ in the phrase _adhivāsanā pahātabbā āsavā_
(the hardships which are to be got rid of through endurance).


The range of activities described in the _Sabbāsava-sutta_ and
its parallels show the central function that the overcoming of the
_āsava_ s and their 'influence' on the mind can have for various aspects of the Buddhist monastic scheme of training. In this way,
the notion of purifying the mind from the 'influence' of the _āsava_ s
can be seen to span the whole range of monastic practice from
such activities as guarding the sense-doors, using one's requisites
properly, enduring hardship, and avoiding what is dangerous and
unsuitable, to removing what is unwholesome, establishing a vision of the four noble truths, and developing the awakening factors,
a development whose successful implementation culminates in
the destruction of the influxes with full awakening. [83]

This indication could provide an answer to a problem raised by
Keown in a paper entitled "Buddhism: Morality without Ethics?"
Keown (2006: 47) reasons that "while Buddhism has a good deal
to say about morality, it has little or nothing to say about ethics"
(here he uses the term "ethics" as a referent to "moral theory" or
"normative ethics"). Keown (2006: 50) comments on


the Five Precepts and the rules of the _Vinaya_, these are
typically presented simply as injunctions, rather than as conclusions logically deduced from explicitly stated values and
principles. In other words, the Precepts are simply announced,
and one is left to figure out the invisible superstructure from
which they are derived. Thus although Buddhism has normative teachings, it does not have normative ethics.


Yet, as the foregoing discussion would have shown, the rules
of the _Vinaya_ (and by implication also the precepts for lay followers) are considered to be derived from an explicit value or principle, namely the removal of the _āsava_ s. Therefore the early Bud

330  _Vinaya_ Studies


dhist counterpart to normative ethics could be found precisely in
the notion of freeing the mind from the influxes. Preventing and
overcoming the _āsava_ s appears to be what, from the _Vinaya_ standpoint forms the determining principle that guides and regulates
monastic conduct.

Restraining and removing the _āsava_ s thereby seems to constitute the Buddhist counterpart to normative ethics. This can be seen
as setting the goal and the parameters for moral injunctions. In
fact the _Samaṇamaṇḍika-sutta_ and its parallel indicate that moral
conduct, or its opposite of immoral forms of behaviour, has its
origin in the mind. [9] Hence purifying the mind from the influxes
would be what provides Buddhist morality with its rationale, and
at the same time forms its culmination point. [84]

The significance of purification of the mind and its relation to
moral restraint can perhaps best be captured in a stanza found in
the different _Dharmapada_ s, which several _Vinaya_ s have as part of
the conclusion of their code of rules ( _pātimokkha_ ):


Not doing any evil,
undertaking what is wholesome,
cleansing one's mind,
this is the teaching of Buddhas. [10]

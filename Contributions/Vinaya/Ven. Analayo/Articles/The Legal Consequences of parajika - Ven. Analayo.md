## _Bhikkhu Anālayo_



In this article I explore the legal consequences a fully ordained monk (and by implication a fully ordained nun) incurs on violating a _pārājika_ rule. I begin with the
relevant indications given in the code of rules ( _prātimokṣa_ / _pātimokkha_ ) itself,
before turning to the story of a monk who had apparently violated such a rule and
still tried to participate in the _uposatha_ observance, the fortnightly recital of the
code of rules.


Next I take up the difference between being no longer considered part of the
community of fully ordained monks and the residential right to live in a particular
monastery, since I believe that keeping in mind this distinction can avoid possible
confusions about the significance of being “in communion”, _saṃvāsa_ . [1] Based on
this distinction, I then examine which of these two meanings corresponds to the
legal consequences of a breach of a _pārājika_ regulation and evaluate the _śikṣādat_ _taka_ observance mentioned in a range of _Vinaya_ s, together with the conclusions that
can be drawn from its absence in the Theravāda _Vinaya_ .


**Reciting the Code of Rules**


In what follows I take as my example the case of a fully ordained monk who voluntarily engages in sexual intercourse without having beforehand given up his
ordained status. According to a stipulation that forms part of the formulation of the
first _pārājika_ in the code of rules of the different Buddhist monastic traditions,
acting in this way turns a monk into one who is “not in communion”, _asaṃvāsa_ . [2]


The idea of a monk who is not in communion can be illustrated with an episode that
depicts an immoral monk seated in a gathering of monks assembled for the recital of
the code of rules. [3] Below I translate one of two similar _Madhyama-āgama_ accounts
of this episode.


Versions of this event can be found in several discourses from different
transmission lineages, among them also two discourses in the _Aṅguttara-nikāya_ and
the _Udāna_ respectively, and as well in various _Vinaya_ s, including the Theravāda
_Vinaya_ . This situation exemplifies a general overlap between discourse and _Vinaya_
texts in the Theravāda tradition and elsewhere, which makes it advisable not to
consider _Vinaya_ literature on its own as the only source for supposed in-house
information on what took place on the ground in the Indian Buddhist monastic
traditions. [4] Instead, both types of text are best read in conjunction.


In the present case, the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ in fact does not report the episode
and instead refers to the _Poṣadha-sūtra_ of the (Mūlasarvāstivāda) _Madhyama-_
_āgama_ for the full story. [5]


Again, whereas Buddhaghosa’s _Manorathapūraṇī_ and Dhammapāla’s _Paramattha_ _dīpanī_ offer detailed information on this episode, this is not the case for the _Vinaya_
commentary _Samantapāsādikā_ . [6] This implies that the reciters both of the Mūlasar

vāstivāda _Vinaya_ and of the Pāli commentaries expected their audience or
readership to use _Vinaya_ material alongside discourse material, rather than in
isolation.


**Translation (1)**


At that time, it being the fifteenth of the month and the time to recite
the code of rules, the Blessed One sat in front of the community of
monks on a prepared seat. Having sat down, the Blessed One in turn
entered concentration and with the knowledge of the mind of others
he surveyed the minds in the community. Having surveyed the
minds in the community, he sat silently until the end of the first
watch of the night.


Then one monk got up from his seat, arranged his robes over one
shoulder and said, with his hands held together towards the Buddha:
“Blessed One, the first watch of the night has already come to an
end. The Buddha and the community of monks have been sitting
together for a long time. May the Blessed One recite the code of
rules.”


Then the Blessed One remained silent and did not reply. Thereupon
the Blessed One kept sitting silently further through the middle
watch of the night.


Then that one monk got up again from his seat, arranged his robes
over one shoulder and said, with his hands held together towards the
Buddha: “Blessed One, the first watch of the night has passed and
the middle watch of the night is about to end. The Buddha and the
community of monks have been sitting together for a long time.
May the Blessed One recite the code of rules.”


The Blessed One again remained silent and did not reply. Thereupon
the Blessed One kept sitting silently further through the last watch
of the night.


Then that one monk got up from his seat for a third time, arranged
his robes over one shoulder and said, with his hands held together
towards the Buddha: “Blessed One, the first watch of the night has
passed, the middle watch of the night has also come to an end, and
the last watch of the night is about to end. It is near dawn and soon
the dawn will arise. The Buddha and the community of monks have
been sitting together for a very long time. May the Blessed One
recite the code of rules.”


Then the Blessed One said to that monk: “One monk in this community has become impure.”


At that time the venerable Mahāmoggallāna was also among the
community. Thereupon the venerable Mahāmoggallāna thought in


3


Bhikkhu Anālayo


turn: ‘Of which monk does the Blessed One say that one monk in
this community has become impure? Let me enter an appropriate
type of concentration so that, by way of that appropriate type of
concentration, by knowing the minds of others, I will survey the
minds in the community.’


The venerable Mahāmoggallāna entered an appropriate type of concentration so that, by way of that appropriate type of concentration,
by knowing the minds of others, he surveyed the minds in the community. The venerable Mahāmoggallāna in turn knew of which
monk the Blessed One had said that one monk in this community
had become impure.


Thereupon the venerable Mahāmoggallāna rose from concentration
and went in front of that monk, took him by the arm and led him out,
opening the door and placing him outside [with the words]: “Foolish
man, go far away, do not stay in here. You are no longer in
communion with the community of monks, since you have now
already left it, no [longer] being a monk.” He closed the door and
locked it.


**Study (1)**


After Mahāmoggallāna has taken the culprit out, the Buddha explains that he will no
longer recite the code of rules for the monks and, in the version translated above,
describes how someone might falsely pretend to be a true monk until his companions recognize him for who he truly is. [7] In most of the versions that I will be
considering below, the Buddha instead delivers a comparison of qualities of the
monastic community with those of the ocean.


Except for the _Madhyama-āgama_ tradition, an individually translated discourse, and
the Sarvāstivāda _Vinaya_, [8] other accounts of this episode do not mention that the
Buddha had surveyed the minds of the monks in the community, information that is
found, however, in the Pāli commentaries. [9] This concords with a general pattern of
a commentarial type of information making its way into some canonical texts during
the course of transmission until these texts reach a point of closure. [10]


The two Pāli discourse versions that report this episode, together with several parallels preserved as individual translations, a discourse quotation in the _Abhidharma_ _kośopāyikā-ṭīkā_, as well as the Mahīśāsaka, Mahāsāṅghika, Dharmaguptaka, and
Theravāda _Vinaya_ s, identify the monk who requested the Buddha three times to
recite the code of rules as having been Ānanda. [11]


According to the _Aṅguttara-nikāya_ version (together with the _Udāna_ discourse and
the Theravāda _Vinaya_ ), an _Ekottarika-āgama_ parallel, and a version preserved as an
individual translation, Mahāmoggallāna had first told the monk to leave, and only
when the culprit did not take any action did Mahāmoggallāna put him outside forcefully. [12]

SIJBS Volume V


In a version preserved as an individual translation the Buddha himself encourages
Mahāmoggallāna to survey the assembly in order to identify the culprit, [13] and in
another individually preserved discourse the Buddha even asks Mahāmoggallāna to
take the immoral monk out. [14]


Alongside such variations, however, the parallel versions agree on the basic denouement of events. In spite of repeated requests, the Buddha does not recite the code of
rules because an immoral monk is present in the community. Mahāmoggallāna spots
the culprit and puts him outside of the building in which the _uposatha_ ceremony
was to be held. The fact that in all versions the immoral monk is removed from the
location where the code of rules is to be recited makes it clear that he must have
committed a breach of a _pārājika_ rule. In fact the Pāli versions, for example, qualify
him as one who pretended to be celibate but did not practise celibacy. [15]


The account of this episode in the _Aṅguttara-nikāya_ version has been taken by JuoHsüeh Shih (2000: 144 and 148) to convey the sense that the guilty monk “remained
in the community”, a supposed inconsistency that then leads her to the assumption
that perhaps


at the very outset of Buddhist monasticism, even the gravest offence
may not have incurred expulsion from the _Saṅgha_ in the sense of
permanent excommunication involving loss of monastic status.


The passage from the _Aṅguttara-nikāya_ version on which she bases this conclusion
describes that the ocean washes any corpse ashore, comparable to how the monastic
community does not associate with an immoral person. [16] The relevant passage states
that


even though he is seated in the midst of the community of monks,
yet he is far from the community and the community is far from him.


The idea that this implies some sort of leniency for even the gravest offence appears
to be based on a misunderstanding of this passage. It simply reflects the situation
that prevailed throughout the night before Mahāmoggallāna took action. In fact the
previous part of the discourse employs the same expression “seated in the midst of
the community of monks” to refer to the immoral monk spotted by Mahāmoggallāna. [17]


Even though this immoral monk was seated among the community of monks, due to
his moral failure he was already not in communion and for this reason was far from
the monastic community already at that time.


Instead of implying some sort of leniency, the passage rather helps to clarify that
not being in communion does not depend on an action taken by others to expulse an
immoral monk, but is something that happens as soon as the _pārājika_ rule is broken.
From that moment onwards, the monk is _de facto_ no longer a fully ordained monk
and _de facto_ no longer in communion, even if he pretends otherwise and goes so far
as to seat himself among a congregation of monks at the time of the recital of the
code of rules. [18]

Bhikkhu Anālayo


This is in fact self-evident from the formulation in the different versions of the
_pārājika_ rule quoted at the outset of this article. The condition of _asaṃvāsa_ is
incurred right at the time of the moral breach. The principle behind this is that
communion obtains only for the morally pure with others who are also pure. [19]


An additional argument by Shih (2000: 141) involves another discourse in the
_Aṅguttara-nikāya_, which according to her assessment implies that “one can make
good by atonement even for an offence of Defeat.”


The passage in question states that “one who has committed a _pārājika_ offence will
‘ _paṭikaroti_ ’ according to the Dharma.” [20] The key for understanding this passage is
the term _paṭikaroti_, which I have on purpose not translated in order to leave room
for first ascertaining its meaning. Another occurrence of the term _paṭikaroti_,
together with the same qualification of being done “according to the Dharma”, can
be found in the _Sāmaññaphala-sutta_, after King Ajātasattu had just confessed that
he had killed his father. The Buddha replies that in this way the king has performed
an action described as _paṭikaroti_ “according to the Dharma”. [21]


Although this verb on its own can at times convey meanings like “make amendment
for”, “redress”, or “atone”, since the king was not a monastic (in fact previous to
this visit not even a lay follower of the Buddha), in the present context the whole
phrase cannot stand for making amendments for a breach of a monastic rule. Nor
does it seem to imply a successful atoning for the evil done, since as soon as the
king has left the Buddha tells the assembled monks that, due to being a patricide,
Ajātasattu had become unable to realize even the first of the four levels of
awakening. [22] Instead, in the _Sāmaññaphala-sutta_ the phrase _paṭikaroti_ “according to
the Dharma” has the simple sense of a confession. [23]


The same sense is also appropriate for the _Aṅguttara-nikāya_ passage, which on this
understanding describes that “one who has committed a _pārājika_ offence will confess it according to the Dharma.” This fits the context well, since the immediately
preceding part speaks of not even committing a _pārājika_ offence. Thus the remainder of the passage conveys the sense that, if such persons should nevertheless commit a _pārājika_, at least they will confess the moral breach according to the Dharma.


Besides, the same _Aṅguttara-nikāya_ discourse uses the identical expression also in
relation to one who has committed a _pācittiya_ or else a _pāṭidesanīya_ offence. Since
committing a simple _pācittiya_ offence only requires confession, as is the case for a
_pāṭidesanīya_ offence, the phrase _paṭikaroti_ “according to the Dharma” here must
mean precisely that, namely that the breach is being confessed.


Such confession then marks the difference compared to the monk in the _Madhyama-_
_āgama_ passage translated above, who did not confess and instead pretended to be
still in communion by joining the community for the recital of the code of rules. In
such a case an “expulsion” is required, as quite vividly exemplified by the course of
action undertaken by Mahāmoggallāna. The same is not the case for one who confesses “according to the Dharma” a breach of a _pārājika_ rule. In other words, such a
breach invariably entails loss of communion, but does not necessarily require expulsion. [24] As explained by Hüsken (1997: 93),


6


SIJBS Volume V


if an offender is aware of his _pārājika_ offence and leaves the order on
his own initiative, the _Vinaya_ describes no concrete act of expulsion.


The commentary on the _Aṅguttara-nikāya_ discourse explains that a monk who confesses according to the Dharma in this way will be able to continue the monastic life
by establishing himself in the condition of being a novice. [25] The commentary does
not mention other alternatives, giving the impression that this was considered the
appropriate course of action in such a situation.


In sum, the suggestions by Shih are not convincing. Contrary to her presentation, a
monk who has committed a breach of a _pārājika_ rule is indeed “not in communion”,
as indicated explicitly in the various codes of rules, and such loss of communion has
been incurred at the very moment of the breach of morality. Even if such a monk
should be seated among the community, as in the passage translated above, in actual
fact he is far away from it in the sense of no longer being in communion with them.
The question of expulsion is relevant to such a case, not to one who honestly
confesses and in this way acts “according to the Dharma”.


The idea that a breach of a _pārājika_ rule somehow should have only limited consequences has also inspired Kovan (2013: 794), who proposes that “the _pārājika_ rules
(initiated in and) structured around a communal body are attenuated in solitude.”
Kovan (2013: 794 note 27) bases this suggestion on contrasting individual suicides
of monks like Channa to a mass suicide of monks disgusted with their own bodies. [26]
In the case of the mass suicide, according to his assessment


in that communal monastic context the Buddha’s condemnation of
suicide is unequivocal and suggests nothing of the ‘particularism’ of
the responses he appears to bring to the solitary monks in the other
cases.


Now the _pārājika_ rule common to the different _Vinaya_ s concerns killing someone
else as well as inciting someone else to commit suicide or actively assisting in it,
and this sets the context for the story of the mass suicide of monks and their
receiving assistance in killing themselves. In contrast, Channa as an example of “the
solitary monks in the other cases” only killed himself. Thus cases like Channa
cannot reflect a restricted scope of _pārājika_ rules, simply because what he did was
not a breach of a _pārājika_ offence in the first place. Kovan’s idea turns out to be as
groundless as the suggestions by Shih.


**The Community of the Four Directions**


The idea that somehow the _pārājika_ rules must have a more limited scope than usually believed leads me on to a suggestion made by Clarke (2009b), according to
which committing a _pārājika_ offence might only result in a loss of communion with
a specific local community. [27]


His main case study is a tale from the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ about a matricide
whose status as a fully ordained monk is revoked by the Buddha when this becomes
known. The matricide decides not to return to lay life, but goes instead to a remote


7


Bhikkhu Anālayo


place, where a lay supporter builds a dwelling for him that is subsequently also used
by other monks. [28]


Clarke (2009b: 135) interprets this story as implying that the matricide monk was
only


no longer a member of the Buddha’s local monastic community. His
membership in the Community of the Four Quarters, however,
seems not to have been revoked. Accordingly, he was able to go
down the road and join (or even start) another (local) monastic
community, a place in which he would be ‘in communion’.


When evaluating such stories, it needs to be kept in mind, as pointed out by Silk
(2007: 277) in his study of this tale, that


caution would suggest that such stories be read and interpreted in
terms other than as reports of actual incidents which historically led
to the promulgation of particular rules of the Buddhist monastic codes.


This pertinent observation reflects a basic requirement when studying _Vinaya_ narrative, namely a clear recognition of the type of information that such literature can
and cannot yield. As I have argued elsewhere, _Vinaya_ narrative is not comparable to
a record of case-law precedents in modern judicial proceedings, but much rather
serves teaching purposes in the context of legal education in a monastic setting. [29]
Keeping this function in mind helps appreciate why in _Vinaya_ literature legal
discussions and _jātaka_ tales go hand in hand. [30]


This in turn implies, however, that caution is indeed required before taking such
tales as reliable records of what actually happened on the ground and then drawing
far-reaching conclusions, based on them, regarding the significance of being in
communion.


Moreover, it seems preferable not to base any conclusions on what is found in a
single _Vinaya_ only. As succinctly formulated in a different context by Kieffer-Pülz
(2014: 62), “general statements on the basis of only one Vinaya should belong to
the past” of the academic field of Buddhist Studies.


Besides the need for caution when drawing conclusions based on a single _Vinaya_
narrative, even taking the tale of the matricide at face value does not give the impression that it was acceptable for a monk who had lost communion to settle this by
just proceeding to another local community. The point rather seems to be that the
matricide on his own and without any explicitly mentioned precedent or permission
decided to go to a distant place, quite probably just because nobody there would
know him as a matricide. That a lay supporter builds a _vihāra_ for him has no implications regarding the matricide’s status as a fully ordained monk, nor does it imply
that he is truly in communion with other fully ordained monks.


The same holds for the circumstance that other monks come to dwell in that _vihāra_ .
All this could equally well have happened if he simply pretended to be a regular
monk in front of his supporter and the visiting monks, similar to the monk in the


8


SIJBS Volume V


passage from the _Madhyama-āgama_ translated above, who pretended to be still in
communion. [31]


If loss of communion had indeed applied only to a local community, one would
expect stories reflecting this understanding to be reported in the different _Vinaya_ s.
Take for example a monk obsessed with seducing women, who could continue
having sex with any women he is able to approach as a monk by simply moving
from one local community to the next, as soon as he is discovered. Records of such
monks, together with the vexation their behaviour caused to well-behaved monks
and the outraged reaction of the husbands in particular and the laity in general
would surely have stood good chances of inspiring the narrative imagination of the
reciters of the different _Vinaya_ s.


Moreover, given the peregrination of monks from one monastery to another, the
idea of communion with a local community would not be particularly practicable. In
concrete terms it would mean that the culprit would be barred from staying at the
monastery in which he was dwelling when committing his breach of conduct. A
ruling which envisages only loss of residential rights in the local monastery for one
who has committed a _pārājika_ offence would have failed to fulfil its purposes,
which the _Vinaya_ s indicate to be restraining badly behaved monks and protecting
well-behaved monks, inspiring non-Buddhists and increasing the faith of
Buddhists. [32]


In sum, the consequences that Clarke’s suggestion entails on a practical level make
it safe to conclude that the idea that a _pārājika_ offence only entails loss of
communion with a local community is unconvincing.


Besides, the present tale is not even a case of having committed a _pārājika_ offence,
as noted by Clarke (2009b: 126) himself. The killing of the mother took place when
the protagonist of the tale was still a lay person. Therefore he had not committed an
infraction of any _pārājika_ rule, which only applies to fully ordained monastics. The
present case thereby seems similar in this respect to the suggestion by Kovan, which
was also based on drawing conclusions about the scope of _pārājika_ based on stories
that do not involve a breach of a _pārājika_ rule.


In the present case, as a matricide the monk was held unfit for higher ordination,
presumably due to not standing a chance of realizing awakening (comparable to
Ajātasattu as a patricide). This leaves hardly any room for considering this story as
hinting at loss of communion being only relevant to a local community.


Instead of the approach taken by Clarke, it seems to me that a proper appreciation of
the significance of loss of communion for a monk who has committed a _pārājika_
offence lies in the opposite direction, namely by setting aside as irrelevant to this
topic the issue of being allowed to live in a particular monastery. This has no direct
bearing on the question of being considered a full member of the community of the
four directions, since these two are distinct matters. As explained by Nolot (1999:
59f note 9),


9


Bhikkhu Anālayo


absolute _a-saṃvāsa_ is incurred by monks and nuns who have committed a Pār[ājika] offence and are, as a consequence, deprived of
their very status: they are said not to belong to the (universal) Saṃgha
anymore.


When Clarke (2009b: 132) reasons: “whether or not one can be expelled from the
Community of the Four Quarters is not clear, at least to me”, then perhaps a simile
from the modern living situation of an academic might help to clarify the situation.
Suppose someone passes his PhD exam and starts teaching as an assistant professor,
but then is found out to have plagiarized his thesis, whereupon he loses degree and
position. Expressed in _Vinaya_ terminology, he is not in communion with the community of PhD holders of the four directions. He no longer has the right to apply for
a teaching or research position at a university anywhere in the world, claiming to
hold a PhD degree, not only at the university where he originally received his
degree.


Nevertheless, this does not mean he is forbidden to enter the university grounds.
Even at his own university he could still use the library or listen to lectures; if the
university has a hostel he might stay overnight or even live there for an extended
period of time. But he will not be recognized as holding a PhD degree. Conversely,
someone else can be barred from entering the university grounds for a variety of
reasons that need not be related at all to undertaking PhD research or to the degree
to be obtained on properly carrying out such research.


The rather distinct situation of residential rights in a local monastery can be further
illustrated with an excerpt from another discourse in the _Madhyama-āgama_, which I
translate below as a complement to the passage rendered in the first part of this
article. [33] Whereas the first discourse showcases loss of communion with the universal community of the four directions, the present passage rather concerns loss of
residential rights in a local community.


**Translation (2)**


At that time the venerable Dhammika was an elder in his native
region, being in charge of the _stūpa_ and in a position of seniority
towards others. He was fierce, impatient, and very coarse, cursing
and condemning other monks. Because of this, all the monks of his
native region left and went away; they did not enjoy staying there.


Thereupon the male lay disciples of his native region, seeing that all
the monks of his native region left and went away, that they did not
enjoy staying there, thought in turn: ‘What is the reason that all the
monks of this native region leave and go away, that they do not enjoy staying here?’


The male lay disciples of his native region heard that the venerable
Dhammika, who was an elder in this native region, being in charge
of the _stūpa_ and in a position of seniority towards others, was fierce,
impatient, and very coarse, cursing and condemning other monks.


10


SIJBS Volume V


Because of this the monks of his native region all left and went
away; they did not enjoy staying there. Having heard it, the male lay
disciples of his native region together approached the venerable
Dhammika and expelled him. They evicted Dhammika from all
monasteries in his native region and made him depart.


Then the venerable Dhammika, having been expelled by the male
lay disciples of his native region, having been evicted from all
monasteries in his native region and made to depart, took his robes
and bowl and went travelling.


**Study (2)**


A parallel to this discourse preserved in the _Aṅguttara-nikāya_ differs in so far as
Dhammika is first told by the lay disciples to go to another monastery still within
his native district. [34] Once he is there, he behaves as earlier, so that the same happens
again and again, and this eventually results in him being expelled from all monasteries in his native region. Another difference is that the _Aṅguttara-nikāya_ version
does not refer to _stūpa_ s, a topic to which I will return at the end of this article.


Although Dhammika had been expelled from all monasteries of his native region,
he remained a fully ordained monk. Expressed in _Vinaya_ legal terminology, he
remained “in communion”. In whatever monastery outside of his native region he
went to stay next, he had the right to act as a fully ordained monk and would have
been not only allowed, but even expected to participate in the recitation of the code
of rules. Although what he had done led to his expulsion from the monasteries of his
native region, his behaviour as such did not involve a breach of any _pārājika_ rule.


Another noteworthy feature of this case is that those who expelled the monk Dhammika were laymen. In other words, not only are residential rights in a local monastery quite different from loss of communion, but decisions regarding such residential rights need not even be taken by monks, as according to the present episode the
laity can do so as well.


In fact, dwelling in a monastery is not an exclusive privilege of fully ordained
monks (or fully ordained nuns in the case of a nunnery). Monasteries can also serve
as a residence for novices, for example, and at times lay people also live in a monastery. Due to the restrictions placed on fully ordained monastics by their rules, they
require the assistance of the laity for certain tasks that they cannot perform themselves, which makes it convenient if such a lay helper also stays in the same monastery. [35]


Thus a fully ordained monk who has lost his status of being in communion can still
continue to live at the very same monastery in which he was staying when his
breach of morality happened. His being no longer in communion only refers to his
inability to function any longer as a fully fledged member of the monastic
community in legal matters, such as participating in the recital of the code of rules, to
stay with the earlier example. Having lost the right to consider himself a fully
ordained monk, he can either live at the monastery as a lay disciple or else, [[BU-AS11]]


Bhikkhu Anālayo


mentioned in the commentary on the _Aṅguttara-nikāya_ passage related to the phrase
_paṭikaroti_ “according to the Dharma”, he can do so having become a novice.


Clarifying the basic distinction between residential permit in a particular monastery
and legal permit to perform legal actions as a fully ordained monk also helps to put
into perspective the _śikṣādattaka_ observance, a provision found in the Dharmaguptaka, Mahāsāṅghika, Mahīśāsaka, Mūlasarvāstivāda, and Sarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ s
applicable to the case under discussion in this paper, namely a monk who has
committed a breach of the _pārājika_ rule on celibacy. [36]


Clarke (2009a: 27), to whom we are indebted for a detailed study of this topic, reports that the “ _śikṣādattaka_ is effectively reduced to a position of subservience and
humility”. In several _Vinaya_ s, such


relegation to a lowly, but still clearly monastic, position is likewise
evident in the requirement that he sit below the most junior of the
monks, and above the novices … he is not to take charge of a novice,
ordain a monk, or admonish nuns … [or else] not permitted to discuss the _Vinaya_, recite or listen to recitations of the _Prātimokṣa_ .


If this is the case, then it is not clear why Clarke (2009a: 8) concludes that the _śik_ _ṣādattaka_ “is most certainly not expelled (or ‘no longer in communion’ [ _asaṃvāsa_ ])”.
As I hope my earlier discussion would have clarified, being expelled needs to be
differentiated from being no longer in communion. The former only applies to
certain cases, the latter to all instances of a breach of a _pārājika_ rule. Regarding the
latter, restrictions of the type mentioned in the quote above do imply that the
_śikṣādattaka_ is no longer in communion, _asaṃvāsa_ . [37]


Since the status of being _śikṣādattaka_ does imply a loss of communion and a demotion in status, this in turn means that, if a fully ordained monk voluntarily engages
in sexual intercourse, this still results in his loss of being in communion. Such loss
in turn affects the institutional reality of Buddhist monasticism in its internal and
external dimensions, inasmuch as he can no longer legitimately perform the
function of perpetuating this monastic institution by conferring valid ordination on
others and would also no longer be reckoned a meritorious recipient of individual
gifts by lay donors comparable to the way in which this was the case before he had
broken a _pārājika_ rule.


Now as Clarke (2009b: 116) rightly notes, “a monk who has sex does not _neces-_
_sarily_ commit a _pārājika_ offence.” An example would be when a monk is mentally
deranged or possessed and therefore not considered accountable for what he does.
But when Clarke backs up his statement in his note 6 by stating: “Take, for instance,
the case of the _pārājika_ penitent or _śikṣādattaka_ ”, followed by reference to his paper
on this topic, then this does not seem to work as a case of sexual intercourse not
being considered a breach of the respective _pārājika_ rule.


The _śikṣādattaka_ observance, in the way summarized by Clarke based on what is
common among the different _Vinaya_ s that recognize this procedure, only institutionalizes the way in which a monk who has offended against a _pārājika_ rule can

continue to live in robes at a monastery in a position situated between novices and
fully ordained monks. It does not change the nature of the _pārājika_ offence itself. [38]
One who has actually committed a _pārājika_ offence is still no longer considered a
fully ordained monk according to these _Vinaya_ s. In fact, if these _Vinaya_ s did not
recognize that having sex, etc., entails a breach of the _pārājika_ rule, there would
hardly have been any need for them to get into devising the _śikṣādattaka_ option in
the first place.


The institution of the _śikṣādattaka_ is in this respect comparable to the option of
becoming a novice, mentioned in the Pāli commentary, by confessing that one has
lost one’s status as a fully ordained monk. In its treatment of the first _pārājika_, the
Pāli _Vinaya_ mentions that one of several ways a fully ordained monk can disavow
his status is by declaring himself to be a novice. [39] Since at the time of ordination he
had received first the going forth, corresponding to novice ordination, and then the
higher ordination as a monk, this means he is giving up only the higher ordination,
not the going forth. This straightforward option does not appear to have been felt to
be in need of further legislation.


The same option is found in the Dharmaguptaka, Mahāsāṅghika, Mahīśāsaka, Mūlasarvāstivāda, and Sarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ s. [40] All of these _Vinaya_ s recognize that a fully
ordained monk, if he wishes to disavow his higher ordination, can do so simply by
declaring himself to be a novice from now on.


This is similar to what can happen when a fully ordained monk confesses according
to the Dharma that he has violated a _pārājika_ rule. The main difference is that when
a monk just decides to become a novice, for whatever reason, he can in principle at
a later time take full ordination again and thereby become once more one who is in
communion. If he becomes a novice after having committed a breach of a _pārājika_
rule, however, the option of becoming a fully ordained monk again is not open to
him. He will no longer be able to become one who is fully in communion.


Thus what happened with the _śikṣādattaka_ observance appears to be that some
_Vinaya_ s carved out a more institutionalized version of the basic option of remaining
in robes at a level below that of a fully ordained monk. This might have occurred in
response to an increase in the number of such cases, leading to a felt need for more
explicit legislation that also ensures that one who is willing to confess and thereby
incur the resultant loss of status as a fully ordained monk can ensure that, following
his demotion in status, at least he will be placed within the monastic hierarchy
above the level of a novice. In several _Vinaya_ s the attractiveness of admitting a
breach of a _pārājika_ seems in fact to have been increased by offering a few
additional privileges, while at the same time keeping the _śikṣādattaka_ observance
still clearly distinct from the condition of being fully in communion.


This in turn gives the impression that the difference between the Theravāda _Vinaya_,
which does not know the _śikṣādattaka_ observance, and the other _Vinaya_ s, which do
contain this option, is mainly one of increasing degrees of institutionalization. It
does not appear to be a difference in principle.

Bhikkhu Anālayo


Therefore Clarke (2009a: 26) is probably right when he envisages, as one of several
possibilities, that


the Pāli _Vinaya_ ’s apparent ignorance of this ecclesiastical provision
may, in this case, reinforce the premise that it represents an older
tradition, one which was transmitted to Sri Lanka prior [to the
arising of the _śikṣādattaka_ observance].


Clarke (2009a: 31) compares the case of the _śikṣādattaka_ observance to that of
monastic regulations related to _stūpa_ s. Similarly to the discourse on Dhammika
translated above, where the Pāli version did not mention the role of its monk protagonist in relation to _stūpa_ s, the Pāli _Vinaya_ also has no reference to regulations in
this respect. This has led Schopen (1989: 95) to the proposal that


the total absence of rules regarding _stūpa_ s in the Pāli _Vinaya_ would
seem to make sense only if they had been systematically removed.


This suggestion earned him immediate criticism. [41] Instead, the absence of any such
reference rather shows that the Theravāda _Vinaya_ was already closed by the time
_stūpa_ s acquired sufficient importance to require monastic legislation. The same
suggests itself for the _śikṣādattaka_ observance, in that the move to institutionalize
the monastic status of a monk who has broken a _pārājika_ rule would have occurred
only at a time when the Theravāda _Vinaya_ was already closed. [42]


Lest I be misunderstood, with the foregoing suggestion I do not intend to promote
the attitude of considering the Pāli _Vinaya_ as invariably earlier than its parallels. In
fact in my comparative studies of the narratives related to the first and third _pārājika_ s
I have argued that the Theravāda account has incorporated later elements and is
therefore definitely not the earliest version at our disposal. [43]


However, these are narratives shared by the different _Vinaya_ s, which thus stand
good chances of representing a common early core, unlike stories found only in
some _Vinaya_ s. [44] Such instances show that the Theravāda _Vinaya_ is as much a
product of the appropriation of later ideas and the embellishment of stories as the
other _Vinaya_ s. Yet, due to the idiosyncrasies of its transmission, in the case of this
particular _Vinaya_ the process of incorporation appears to have come to a comparatively earlier point of closure than in the case of its Indian brethren.


This in turn is significant for evaluating material not found in the Theravāda _Vinaya_
at all, such as regulations concerning _stūpa_ s and the _śikṣādattaka_ observance. Recognizing the significance of such absence makes it possible to construct a
reasonable chronology of developments in Indian Buddhist monasticism.


In other words, it seems fair to conclude that rules on _stūpa_ s and the _śikṣādattaka_
observance are not found in the Theravāda _Vinaya_ quite probably because they
reflect comparatively later concerns. They can certainly be considered as later
concerns than, for example, the notion that committing a _pārājika_ offence equals
immediate and definite loss of communion with the community of fully ordained
monastics in the four directions, a notion reflected explicitly already in the code of
rules of the different _Vinaya_ traditions.

**Conclusions**


A fully ordained monk who willingly engages in sexual intercourse, without having
given up his ordained status, is no longer in communion. Such being no longer in
communion happens right at the time of the moral breach and does not have a
necessary relationship to the monk’s residential rights in a particular monastery. It is
only when the distinction between residential rights and membership in the
community of the four directions is lost sight of that the clear-cut connection
between a breach of a _pārājika_ and the ensuing loss of communion becomes blurred.


The _Aṅguttara-nikāya_ does not recognize a form of atonement for _pārājika_, just as
the _śikṣādattaka_ observance does not imply a re-evaluation of the nature of a _pārā_ _jika_ offence. Instead, the latter only involves an institutionalization of an option already available earlier, namely to continue to live at a monastery in robes but without all the privileges that come with full ordination.


Similarly to the case of _stūpa_ regulations, the absence of references to the _śikṣādat_ _taka_ observance in the Theravāda _Vinaya_ points to the relatively later date of the
corresponding legislations.

Dutt 1984: 107,2 and its Tibetan counterpart in [[DN1]] _ga_ 182a3 or Q 1030 _nge_ 174b5; Chung and

Fukita 2011: 18 report that this Mūlasarvāstivāda discourse version is “not yet known to exist in any
language”. Dhirasekera 1982/2007: 300f seems to have misunderstood this reference in the Sanskrit
version, leading him to conflate it with the ensuing text that concerns another episode and then to
conclude that the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ account differs substantially from the other versions. Shih
2000: 142 note 40 repeats these mistaken conclusions, even though p. 146 note 49 she shows
awareness of the fact that the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ does not report the episode.

that, “though attributed to Buddhaghosa, his authorship can be safely ruled out. The form and content
of the introductory verses are quite different from the beginning of both the _Sumaṅgalavilāsinī_ and
the _Atthasālinī_, and so is the method followed in this commentary”; cf. also Kieffer-Pülz 2015: 431.

23 Rhys Davids 1899: 94 translates the phrase as “confess it according to what is right” and Walshe

1987: 108 as “confessed it as is right”; cf. also Radich 2011: 19. In his detailed study of the present
episode in relation to the significance of confession, Derrett 1997: 59 explains that those in front of
whom such _paṭikaroti_ according to the Dharma takes place “do not forgive or pardon him, nor is the
offence atoned for, or washed away. No ‘amends’ are made … [even] condonation is not in point
here … [but] an acceptance occurs like a creditor’s issuing a receipt.”

24 This goes to show that there is no need to consider the lack of explicit reference to expulsion in

_pārājika_ rules problematic, as done by Shih 2000: 132ff, in reply to which Heirman 2002: 439
clarifies that “the idea of an exclusion is prominently present … [which] the use of the image [of]
‘decapitation’ further points to as being … permanent”; as noted by Ñāṇatusita 2014: cv, the image
of decapitation indeed conveys the gravity of a _pārājika_ breach.

31 In fact Silk 2007: 281 reports that the story continues with one of the disciples, after the death of this

monk, trying to ascertain through supernormal powers where his teacher “has been reborn. Using his
supernatural sight he is able to survey the realms of transmigration ( _saṃsāra_ ), beginning with that of
the gods and, when he does not locate him there, descending through the realms of humans, animals
and hungry ghosts. It is only when he examines the lowest realm, that of hell, that he discovers his
teacher in the great Avīci hell, and upon seeking the cause of his fate learns of his master’s earlier
crime of matricide.” This denouement of the narrative makes it fair to assume that the monk hid his
matricide and pretended to be a fully ordained monk.

35 One example, discussed in Silk 2008: 42ff, is the accepting of donations.
36 On the _śikṣādattaka_ observance cf. also Greene 2017.
37 This has already been pointed out by Sujato 2009: 122 note 192: “the _sikṣādattaka_ ( _sic_ ) is not, contra

Clarke, ‘in communion’.” Wood 2012: 157f and Kaplan 2016: 261, however, unreservedly accept
Clarke’s conclusions.
38 This would also hold for the case story related to the _śikṣādattaka_ observance in the Mūlasar
vāstivāda _Vinaya_ where, according to the detailed study by Clarke 2009a: 16, the narrative unfolds
in such a way that the monk is not considered to have committed a full breach of the _pārājika_ in the
first place. Therefore his being depicted as eventually becoming an arhat and with such attainment
then being reinstated from the _śikṣādattaka_ level to that of a fully ordained monk would have no
consequences for our understanding of what an actual _pārājika_ breach implies, comparable in this
respect to the matricide story from the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ discussed earlier. Since neither
involves a breach of a _pārājika_, they have no direct bearing on what such a breach entails. The
present story only implies that in the Mūlasarvāstivāda _Vinaya_ the _śikṣādattaka_ observance could

also be conferred on those who, due to the circumstances of their deed, were not reckoned as having
committed a full breach of the _pārājika_ rule prohibiting sexual intercourse.
39 Vin III 27,7: _sāmaṇero ti maṃ dhārehī ti_, preceded at Vin III 24,28 by the expression _sāmaṇera_ 
_bhāvaṃ patthayamāno_ . Thanks to the discussion by Kieffer-Pülz 2015/2016 of the different
situation for nuns in this respect, I became aware of the proposal by Paṇḍita 2016 of two modes of
disavowal of one’s higher ordination, of which the supposedly earlier one did not involve any of the
ways described in the passage under discussion. Now the function of a word explanation ( _pada-_
_bhājanīya_ ) in the _Vinaya_ is to explain and define, not necessarily to promulgate something new.
Thus the present word explanation only implies that the listed ways of disavowal of one’s higher
ordination are from now on those considered legally valid from the viewpoint of _pārājika_ casuistic.
It does not imply that these ways had never been in use earlier and only came into existence with the
arising of this commentary. Besides, the two examples Paṇḍita 2016: 2f gives for the supposedly
earlier mode of disavowal concern a monk who mistakenly believes he has lost communion and a
nun who has lost communion and concealed it; neither is a case of a successful disavowal of the
higher ordination.

41 Gombrich 1990, Hallisey 1990, and von Hinüber 1990; cf. also Dhammadinnā 2016: 44ff for a

critical appraisal of a to some extent related suggestion by Schopen 1996 on the supposed absence
of references to _stūpa_ s for nuns.
42 Sujato 2009: 234–237 comes to the same conclusion regarding _stūpa_ regulations and the _śikṣā_ 
_dattaka_ training. However, he also brings in the _sikkhamānā_ training in this conclusion, where I find
his overall treatment of this topic unconvincing; for two points of disagreement cf. Anālayo 2015:
412 note 11 and 2016a: 97f note 23.
43 Cf. Anālayo 2012a and 2014.
44 On the principle that parallelism points to a common early core, contrary to the position taken by

Schopen 1985, cf. Anālayo 2012b.
